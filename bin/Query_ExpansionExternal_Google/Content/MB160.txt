However, social media offers plenty of opportunities for learning and interactivity, and if you take a moment to think about it, it’s not too hard to see how students benefit from using social media. As younger generations use such technology in the classroom, they remake the educational landscape. Students are experiencing the world through more than just books and assignments; they are learning and adapting to the world using a relatively new form of communication. In a world where connections are important, graduates are coming into the workplace with a lot to offer. But what exactly are they learning? Read on to find out. Connections Social media networks are designed for the purpose of communal connections. Today’s students are accessing Facebook, Twitterand even Instagram to connect and share with those around them. One of the most interesting things about social media is that users can interact and engage with each other solely through a Web presence, perhaps never even meeting in person. Web engagement Whether they are sharing personal pictures, links to other sites or even commenting on someone’s post, students engage, stretching beyond social interaction purposes alone. Students use social media day in and day out to interact with their peers and even teachers about class-related subjects. In a world where online engagement is important for businesses, these students are becoming experts at developing a sense of Internet presence. Not only do they know how to interact with others on the internet, they know how to use basic and even complex functions in order to do so. Knowledge Social media users share among themselves day in and day out, giving and receiving information at rapid speeds. This information is more than funny cat videos; they share views and opinions; tips, tricks, and even DIY projects; and, among students, helpful information for classes. Their ability to assess, analyze, retain and share information is skyrocketing and they often don’t even realize they’re developing these skills. Only people born before the Internet was invented are likely to understand the magnitude of this new style of communication. Social Media Marketing The advent and dominance of social media has created a new breed of marketing, which has required professionals to build and further the field. As social media users join the workforce, they bring their skills to their careers. Social media prepares young workers to become great marketers. It has become essential for major businesses to include a social media marketing strategy and students today are the people filling these positions. While older generations might not completely understand or agree with the amount of social media activity by today’s student population, they will quickly benefit from it. As technology advances, so does the way the world works with it. Members of the young workforce are keeping up to speed with many forms of social media. Once you get a proper social media marketing strategy locked in, you’ll be grateful for the recent graduate you’ve hired to carry out the details.

Which Universities Are Effectively Using Social Media? 4 TED Talks That Will Make You Want To Explore The World 3 Ways EdTech Is Moving Beyond the Classroom 4 Comments Stan Dura February 12, 2013 at 11:31 am These are certainly worthy and hopeful outcomes, but unfortunately there is little data to back them up. In some cases, actually, data suggest some negative possible outcomes. 2007 data from HERI (http://heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/pubs/briefs/brief-091107-SocialNetworking.pdf) shows that students who engage social media more often also engage in more frequent and problematic drinking habits, have trouble managing their time, and have trouble developing effective study habits. The social nature of social media may engage less professional thought and behavior than we might think or want. Professionals need to be able to manage their time well and know how to learn on their own if they are going to succeed in a rapidly changing professional landscape. So use of social media may not result in all positive outcomes, and the “sum” of its influence on any particular student is likely complex. I think it important then to be cautious and diligent when considering and reporting the impact of social media on college students, and I believe we should be very thoughtful and deliberate when we utilize it as an educational tool as many educators are indeed doing. Otherwise we are essentially assuming students are learning exactly what we would want them to learn simply by chance, and that is improbable. James Wilson February 16, 2013 at 10:38 am Stan is correct in asking for data to support the claims that social media is indeed beneficial. However the link between social media and “frequent and problematic drinking habits”.. and less ” professional thought and behavior” needs to be unpacked with some concrete evidence. I, like the author Joseph Baker, see social media as an unprecedented boon to education. I believe anyone who has creatively and meaningfully employed social media in the classroom would agree. Joseph, social media develops skills that we have not yet fully articulated, but skills that will nonetheless define the contours of literacy in the coming future. We are being asked to define success in terms of standardized tests, as this is the “data” requested by Stan. In this realm, social media remains silent. Let’s first take possession of the criterion of success (a massive undertaking), by re-imagining success in analytical form but beyond the scope of standardized tests, and the rest will be breezy… Colette Bennett February 17, 2013 at 7:21 am This is a great resource to argue for acceptable use policies at school that allow for Internet access to social media websites. I just completed professional development at a large suburban high school where blocked access to the Internet left teachers frustrated. “All these wonderful tools,” they sighed, “and we can’t use any of them in class.” My own school unblocked access to the Internet except Facebook (which the students can access anyway), and we are not frustrated. I wrote the following post as testimony to eliminating Internet filters that blocked websites that allow for the kinds of engagement you list above. I also believe access provides educators the opportunity to teach good digital citizenship and use of the Internet for productivity in order to address the concerns of commenters Stan and James: http://wp.me/p1FPEO-1cH rick ackerly February 19, 2013 at 6:02 pm An important message. It is of course rather obvious, but there are still plenty of people wasting their breath on how bad it is, even as they use it.

Previous Page Next Page Issue 36 > Contents > Page 3 of 17 Social Media who needs it? Last summer, Kingston Grammar School ICT teacher Matt Britland opened up the debate about the benefits and risks of using social media in teaching and learning in an article for the Guardian Teacher Network. Here, Jisc Inform looks at how universities and colleges are tackling those issues and asks – do we really need to bother? Matt surveyed a small sample of school teachers to uncover their attitudes to social networking as an educational tool and to identify concerns that were stopping more extensive use. Their responses made it clear that, while more than half of the schools use Twitter and nearly a third use Facebook to reach out to students, senior managers had serious concerns focusing on the possibility of cyber bullying and potential invasion of personal space, as well as worries over whether staff had the technical ability to manage social media properly. Those same concerns will be familiar to many managers in higher and further education and they continue to hamper more widespread use of social media as a tool to support teaching and learning. But colleges and universities need to embrace social media because it is now one of the main ways that young adults communicate, along with texting and instant messaging. Matt argued in his article that forcing students down the email route because we think it makes our lives easier is likely to be a mistake and that, in his experience, institutions that use Facebook groups to communicate with students report that they pick up their Facebook messages far quicker than their emails.   “In my experience of using Facebook groups with students they pick up communications far quicker than email.” Matt Britland ICT teacher, Kingston Grammar School   So what do the students think? Lila Rasche, age 18, studying Performing Arts at Shrewsbury College of Arts and Technology tells us about the student's perspective of using social media to access educational materials (01:45). play pause     At the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) the Information Team has been using Twitter for the last two years as a highly effective way to update students on exam timetables, grant information, housing benefits, opportunities and events. Information team member Lee Hoskinson said: “Twitter is such a fast way to get important information out to staff and students, even more so now that we’ve learned a few tricks such as how to schedule tweets in advance. There is lots of help available to users on the Twitter site and we’ve learned how to improve it as we have gone along.” That’s not to say social media is always the best way to communicate – just that sometimes it could be. Matt believes it is worth asking students if they would like to have a way of communicating via social media and what platform they would prefer to use. Concerns about how to ‘do it’ are certainly not insurmountable. Many people already know how to use Facebook and Twitter, and both are very easy to learn via helpful hints and tips on the sites themselves. Once you have decided on a strategy and set the wheels in motion, it’s unlikely that staff or students will need much of an induction to get them started. Matt comments: “At its simplest, social media can be used to broadcast information. Using Twitter simply to push out information or to share links related to teaching and learning is the ‘safe’ first step for many, and if a broadcast account is linked to the department’s RSS feed, it reduces the need to keep tweeting news items. It can still be used for bespoke tweets when necessary – and if the profile states clearly that the account is for broadcasting information only, it will not look unprofessional or rude if you don’t respond to tweets.” One important concern for staff, which Matt understands, is that using social networks could encroach on personal space. He feels that students worry less about this and are happier for their private and academic lives to merge, but for staff, the simple answer is not to use a personal profile for whichever social network you choose. Having a second, professional profile gives the staff members some space. It’s about setting up ground rules that everyone in the department or group is comfortable with.     Boosting staff and student engagement Biting the bullet and using social media to engage staff and students is a great way to encourage feedback, both good and bad. Some of the world’s largest and most successful corporations are finding that social media is an increasingly popular way for customers to offer both praise and criticism, and universities and colleges can harness it in the same way. Social media specialist Charlie Pownall offers some useful pointers for turning criticism to your advantage. His top 6 tips:    Respond quickly (within hours)    Be accurate    Be flexible    Be transparent    Be sincere    Be human Last academic year, when Shrewsbury College wanted to trial the use of Facebook in its sports department, information and learning technology and digital marketing developer Richard Booth set up the account in accordance with his own guidance documentation to ensure both efficiency and the safety of group members. His approach was to: Create a separate, dedicated account Manage the settings so that no-one outside the intended group members could become a friend Personally set up the groups Appoint two staff moderators to manage posts Make the groups private once the intended members had joined, so they were invisible to outsiders The college’s sports pilot was so successful in bringing students back to the college’s Moodle site that Facebook and Twitter are now routinely used in marketing for around 34 groups across the curriculum and Richard says that there have been no cases of bullying via the college’s social media networks. The only negative issue to date, according to Richard, has been that “a handful of tutors report that it is causing distractions in lessons. This is, I think, a longer discussion about classroom management and course delivery. Overall social media is proving to be a great tool to keep the students engaged. My remit is to help staff and students to realise that these are valuable tools that are really easy for anyone to use.”   “My remit is to help people realise these are valuable tools that are really easy for anyone to use.” Richard Booth Information and learning technology and digital marketing developer, Shrewsbury College   More info… You can follow Matt Britland on Twitter.   You might like… If you liked this article you might also find these of interest: Jisc’s advice on engaging with students by embracing mobile.

Below you can find a translated version - happy reading!  I hope you find it interesting - and any questions or feedback is highly appreciated.         Social media is increasingly becoming part of everyday working life. Initial experience has underlined the importance of integrating social media into IT infrastructures and business processes to ensure they become an integral part of the working day. If used properly, social media can help companies run more effectively, including in the area of learning & talent development (L&D) and associated areas such as knowledge management and change management. If done right social media can help to optimize knowledge work tremendously. L&D managers can assume key driving roles here: by using social media in typical personnel development processes, as experts in facilitation, instructional design, or change management, and in their roles as educational experts.         Introduction Social media employ web- and mobile-based technologies to support interactive dialogue. According to Wikipedia, it can “introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between organizations, communities, and individuals.” They involve information, communication, collaboration, knowledge management, multimedia, and entertainment. As new technologies continue to emerge, the area is constantly developing – be it the use of location recognition/GPS, “Big Data”, and of new devices such as tablets, or the introduction of new combinations, such as new business models.   Since the triumph of the smartphone, there is no longer any question about sustainability of social media in the future. “Generation Y” will promote the use of social media in the workplace – and social media will have to be used to recruit and retain particularly talented employees in the face of the increasing shortage of qualified personnel.     These technical innovations will also support more effective learning, knowledge transfer, and talent management. L&D managers need to consider: How they can best use these new media in their areas How this can change their role as personnel development manager   Integrating social media into existing processes has proven to be more effective than simply making the technology available to employees.       Potential Uses of Social Media Using social media changes general communication values. New values include freedom from hierarchy (anyone can contact anyone else) and transparency (all information is accessible within one's own network at least). Career values have also changed. Motivation at work stems more and more from quality of work, lifestyle, development opportunities, and employer branding.   The values associated with social media, and the new career values in which social media also represent a lifestyle tool, must be taken into account when social media are used. Social media such as Facebook fan pages and LinkedIn have been used as job search engines in the area of recruiting for quite some time. How social media can be used in learning and talent development is now also being considered. Let us now look at some possible scenarios.       On-Demand Learning and Knowledge Management Content and experience in wikis, for example, can help optimize knowledge management and accelerate informal learning. Implicit knowledge is made explicit thanks to comments, ratings, user contributions, and discussions – and the highly valued user-generated content that emerges becomes organizational knowledge. Some applications provide features for adding and sharing videos or screenshots directly from social media platforms. This further transforms users into content and media producers. What results is a searchable knowledge base that could never be created with the same scope, up-to-date information, speed, cost-effectiveness, and quality by central departments.     Learning and obtaining information quickly as part of the job, for example, to solve a specific problem, are integral daily tasks in knowledge-intensive jobs. Not everything can be learned in advance nowadays. Wikipedia is a particularly useful and popular problem-solving tool used by many. Such scenarios can also be implemented internally within companies – thereby ensuring data privacy and legal protection. This allows employees to use social networks to find experts who can help them further, for example. Or they can find solutions in user-generated content, such as that available in discussion forums or company wikis.   Social media should ideally be integrated directly into work processes. Forums or wiki pages could be incorporated into product documentation, for example, enabling users to help themselves with support from facilitating experts. Another example would be a forum for every sales order created in which questions or documents could be exchanged as part of customer support. If on-demand learning is made an integral part of the working environment and existing processes, it is no longer learning – but part of the job.     An example from personnel development would be social media features integrated into the learning infrastructure, such as course ratings and comments. This allows learners to obtain valuable information when selecting courses and share their views with other learners based on the comments. Ideally, learners would be able to search for formal content (such as training courses and e-learnings) and use the same search function to find user-generated content (informal content such as wiki contributions and videos).       Communities of Practice (CoP) Communities of practice (CoP) are an established method that has been boosted through the use of social media. These are communities of experts that are interconnected informally and that face similar tasks. Social media platforms can provide the “adhesive glue” within these communities. If an established expert group has reached a certain size and is adequately distributed, the CoP can also function independently via social media without considerable integration effort, assuming it is facilitated and managed appropriately. Its success hinges on the commitment and management of the group, however.   In the area of personnel development, a community for talents or high potentials could be a useful application – although integration into a process, namely the talent management process, would also be beneficial in this case. SAP AG, for example, has set up a talent community for its global talents through which all communication is made –from providing information about new development activities and programs, to subsequent questions and comments from talents. The community is facilitated by the talent program managers.     Another potential use is in the onboarding of new employees: New employees can share their initial experiences and network with others. In addition, formal content such as checklists help to shorten time to full productivity.   Another example – open innovation – is evident in the US-based company UST Global. This IT consulting firm uses a social media tool for asynchronous colloquia for idea generation (jam sessions), in which new products are discussed. The company also sets up communities for each customer project, thereby optimizing internal communication for project business.       Blended Learning 2.0 Social media provide tools that are easy to use and can be integrated into existing learning settings, allowing blended learning to be combined with social learning and taken to the next level. Social learning can be defined as learning from and with others using social media. It can take the form of independent learning, on-demand learning, or informal and collaborative learning.     It can involve: Supporting discussions Submitting questions and answers Working through exercises Sharing documents before, during, or after courses   Again, it is important in this case for integration to take place at a methodological and design level. If forums are merely set up for a course, there is no guarantee they will actually be used.   An SAP example of such an application is the Strategy to Action program in which participants use a social media platform to discuss homework between seminars, access course material, and share their experiences. Integrating the social media platform in the instructional design was a key move. Specifically why and how the platform is to be used was explained during the course, for example.     Yet another example is a training program set up by a midsize German bank, in which working and learning tasks for trainees proved to be particularly successful in the sales community. As part of the trainee program, working and learning tasks were announced on the social network, where documents were made available and subsequently processed by learning groups. Trainees were notified about project changes or updates automatically, could set up personal profiles, see which participants were active at any given time, and create their own groups or activities. Such was the success and enthusiasm of the participants for this new form of learning that management decided to make these learning communities the basis for trainee programs across the entire bank group.       Communication & Information Communication can be made more effective through the use of social media. Social media conveniently replace newsletters, central mail inboxes for specific areas or projects, and help optimize communication including feedback and discussion options, for example. This can serve not only to simplify tasks within personnel development (by having blogs for each project), but also to improve the communication of information to internal customers (by means of podcasts or a social networking group for personnel development).       Team and Change Management The key to successful change processes is to ensure that employees are informed sufficiently, trained, and involved in shaping the change. Social media are valuable tools in each of these three areas of action. Furthermore, the introduction of social media should be accompanied by a change process since the transported values are not always in alignment with corporate values. In companies with strict hierarchies in particular, social media must be used purposefully and managed carefully to ensure employees feel encouraged to use them.   Social media offer an array of potential uses from which team development can also benefit. The objective of the “SAP Marketing Film Festival” was to optimize communication between departments, for example. Departments from the various countries involved in SAP Marketing put together videos introducing themselves. They uploaded their podcast videos to a social media platform, where the best video was then determined using the rating function.       Performance Management Social media can also be incorporated into the performance management process and help define and monitor employee goals and further development depending on what is used. In a simple scenario, communities could be set up specifically for this purpose, allowing managers to learn on-demand during the performance management process and get mentored by HR experts.   Using social media for actual performance management, however, is more revolutionary. A product featuring typical social media functions was developed in a pilot project carried out by SAP.     It featured: Employee profiles with options for status updates, feeds, notifications, requests, and so on An option to share goals – publicly or confidentially with the manager A function to publish activities and tasks for each goal, which can be viewed by people in the network over time Evaluations of goals and activities – from managers and other persons It will undoubtedly take some time before such a radical application sees acceptance for binding areas such as performance management, even if the resonance from the US and younger users is extremely positive.         Internal Talent Markets Transparent employee profiles can make talent management more effective. This means moving toward a more transparent internal talent market in which employees search independently for career options (pull instead of push) and (more or less) present themselves using public profiles. This shifts the primary focus to the individual, since talents are becoming more and scarcer due to demographic changes. Employees want to pursue attractive positions, which they determine according to lifestyle, employer branding, or quality of work. In addition to employee transparency, this also demands a high level of transparency for positions in the internal talent market.     If we consider the current practice, which has a strong focus on processes, target profiles for key positions, the definition of successors, or evaluation of performance management data, there is still some way to go. Needless to say, new approaches for internal talent markets have to be integrated into the processes for filling positions and selecting personnel.       Factors for Success and Lessons Learned In recent years, SAP has gained various insights into ensuring the successful implementation of social media. This section presents these insights as success factors and lessons learned. Where infrastructure is concerned, it is important to strike a balance between a centralized and decentralized approach. One common advantage of decentralized pilots is the bottom-up implementation approach that is applied. Since the “social Web” relies on active user participation, this approach is often more effective than a top-down implementation. A further advantage of decentralized pilots is flexible, rapid success. In contrast, the advantage of a centralized approach is the integrated infrastructure and the close alliance with the IT department.     The long-term objective should always be to integrate new social media tools into the standard IT landscape in a way that allows structured content on the corporate portal to be found, in addition to podcasts, wiki pages, or forum posts. Central user management systems can be used in parallel to facilitate simple, high-quality user management.The technical foundations on which social media are used must be solid: Software performance must be fast and tools must be easy to use. Fundamental issues, such as data privacy and reporting, must first be addressed with the relevant committees and approved by the works council (in countries where this is relevant).     As with all trends driven by technology, it is always important to focus on the value added rather than getting caught up in the technology euphoria. It is crucial to always consider the actual objectives of a measure to ensure the best methods and tools are ultimately used. There are a number of proven nontechnical measures, such as providing coffee corners, peer learning, coaching, and mentoring,, which can also help promote informal learning.   The trend for «social» technologies is shifting from individual tools to corporate social media platforms that merge all relevant functions – from wikis and blogs to groups/rooms and profiles, and even mobile apps. Mobile access via apps or browsers on tablet PCs has become a must.     In some scenarios, such as communities of practice, these platforms can be used independently. Social media can also be integrated into online help for systems – to help users help themselves. It is generally beneficial to integrate social media into business processes and systems used. This integration may automate certain activities (automatic creation of collaboration groups, automatic assignment of participants when courses are booked, and so on) and thereby improve operational efficiency. While free platforms are a good option for pilots, they are not considered sustainable options in the medium term since they are generally financed by advertising and the sale of user data.     As a solution provider, SAP offers its customers a range of predefined integration options, both for existing customers who have already installed SAP products in their corporate infrastructure, and customers who want to subscribe to software via the Internet (cloud software). The SAP social media tools can be integrated into business processes based on the approach deemed most suitable.       Usability Requirements Even if the tools are essentially easy to use, it is important to ensure that users are able to use them – by providing FAQ lists, short multimedia units, demos, instructions, or overviews indicating how each tool is to be used for what, for example.   Social media guidelines can help make requirements for the use of social media transparent. These guidelines should reflect corporate culture and should not be limited to general, socially desirable statements. Should barriers be identified (in the manner in which knowledge is shared, for example), change management measures to adapt the learning and knowledge culture must be initiated.   Special considerations must be made for older employees – since the younger generation who are more familiar with the use of social media tools are just a subset of the workforce. Examples, demonstrations, and specific situations can be used to allay fears. A critical mass of users and a facilitator for the startup phase are required to ensure sufficient activity.     Typical user types and distribution of users are as follows: 70% lurkers: users who are logged on and view content, but do not actively participate in the community 20% commenters: users who comment on or reply to existing articles, blogs, questions, or similar 10% creators: highly active community users who submit articles or create blogs, for example – to set up effective communities some creators need to be available and motivated, ideally in the set-up phase.     Board blogs written by communication departments are rarely successful due to their lack of authenticity. A more successful approach is to use multipliers such as trainees and students as “teachers” and reverse mentors for Web 2.0 tools. Fears about potential tool misuse (such as hidden performance management) should be addressed openly and specifically discussed with committees such as the works council or data security officers.       Processes and Content Social media tools such as communities are not “self-running.” They have to be managed and supported. This requires new roles to be defined or existing roles to be extended, such as those of trainers or personnel development managers. Community facilitators, online mentors, and wiki gardeners are the new roles to be filled. And working hours and resources must be allocated accordingly.     Using early existing available content- whether podcasts or discussions - plays an important role in generating immediate benefit. This can be achieved using instructions at the meta-level or exceptional content, examples of which would be contributions from known persons or valued experts within the company, or articles on relevant topics such as strategic initiatives or new products.     It is crucial to align content with corporate priorities and to avoid limiting the focus only to typical education fields such as languages or management training. However, content that is sensitive or legally binding is less appropriate on social media. It is important to define clearly which content is to be managed and is therefore safeguarded, validated, reliable, binding, and up to date, and hence is not suitable as user-generated content.     Personnel development departments should strive for an instructional design integration to ensure that social media are not an end to themselves, but an integral part of learning arrangements. When social media are introduced, it is important to define success criteria using key figures such as (active) use, contributions, acceptance, and perceived benefit. At SAP, for example, statistics are recorded on the number of podcasts created and used, wiki entries and basic read access, top ratings and top discussions. This information is also channeled back to communities to motivate contributors and draw attention to content of particular interest.       Role of Learning and Talent Development and Management L&D managers in particular can contribute significantly to social media implementations – be this their competence in change processes, or their pedagogic competence. This helps prevent social media implementations from becoming too technology oriented. In addition to including social media in their service portfolio, L&D managers can use social media to position themselves strategically as competent points of contact.   These examples underline the many ways in which social media can support personnel development. And associations such as the American Society of Training & Development highlight their growing relevance, declaring social learning a new “area of expertise” in 2011.     These competencies include: The use of social learning technologie Knowledge of various tools, their areas of application, and their limitations Techniques in overcoming organizational hurdles during implementation   Management will also be faced with new requirements. In an environment in which it is established practice to voice criticism and feedback, they can expect decisions to be called into question more often and become more difficult to enforce. If hierarchies in a company have strongly shaped its decision making to date, the interaction structures on the social Web call for decision-making facilitation rather than decision making. This demands more responsibility and commitment from employees and less governance from managers.       I hope this article was useful and informative.
