This action makes no sense. Private security screeners, under the oversight of TSA, are a perfectly legitimate and secure method for handling the screening of airline passengers. This move—as well as recent changes in the primary screening process, including the extensive deployment of full-body scanners (and/or physical pat-downs), at U.S. airports—raises serious concerns about the Administration’s aviation security strategy. The Screening Partnership Program Currently, 16 airports take advantage of the SPP. Several other airports have applications pending. The program allows airports, upon approval by TSA, to use private security personnel rather than federal workers to perform security screening services. The private companies are required to maintain the same security standards, training, and equipment as government-run security operations and are subject to extensive oversight. Friday’s announcement was that TSA would not approve the application of Springfield-Branson Airport in Missouri. Pistole emphasized that he would not “expand the program beyond the current 16 airports as I do not see any clear or substantial advantage to do so at this time.” Such a move is directly contrary to the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, which statutorily grants this ability to airports through TSA. TSA, on its own Web site, has even touted (and continues to tout) the program as a successful endeavor that maintains security while giving airports flexibility over their security workforces. Security Politics Pistole, for his part, has given little explanation as to why the program would no longer add any additional participants. Several public-sector employee unions, however, praised the measure. These are the same groups that not only have rallied against the SPP but have aggressively lobbied Congress for collective bargaining rights for these same government screeners. On this matter specifically, they have argued that privatization is a threat to security. The insinuation, however, that effective security can be accomplished only through a government-directed and -run operation is ludicrous. Privately run security operates around the country in a variety of sectors and yields excellent results. But more specifically, privatized airports under SPP have had the same success as their government-run counterparts in terms of security operations: A TSA study found that the performance of SPP participants was roughly equivalent to that of their federal counterparts.[1] Politics has no place in the nation’s security policy. If airports want the flexibility to improve their customer service or have additional reasons why they want to privatize in a manner that maintains security, the government should encourage this effort. Realigning Priorities This action is another move by TSA that simply does not make sense. In recent months, it has received tremendous criticism for its extensive deployment of full-body scanners and/or pat-downs in primary inspection lines. This has significantly tarnished the image of TSA with the American public—and Americans are rightfully upset. Requiring more and more passengers to choose one of these screening methods sends a message that everyone is a terrorist risk when, in fact, almost everyone is an innocent traveler. Foiled plots over the past years since 9/11 demonstrate that stopping terrorism does not begin at the airport screening line; instead, efforts need to focus on improving information-sharing and the ability of law enforcement to track down leads. The right next steps for TSA to reset its course would be to: Embrace the SPP. There is no reason why this program should stop—TSA should resume the application and approval process. Reassess the primary inspection process. Previously, full-body scans and pat-downs were reserved for the secondary inspection line. This is the appropriate place to perform these measures, recognizing that most individuals going through the airport screening line are innocent travelers. TSA should of course retain the flexibility to change its security procedures as it needs to in order to respond to changing threats; however, the move toward blanket scanning of every passenger is a waste of resources and will not make Americans safer. Resist collective bargaining for TSA screeners. Current law gives the TSA Administrator discretion over whether to collectively bargain with airport security screeners. However, TSA should resist doing so. TSA screeners already have the opportunity to belong to a union, and the TSA withholds dues for screeners who request it. But collective bargaining would increase bureaucracy in a way that would hurt the agency’s ability to defend Americans. The Politics of Privatization TSA needs to reassess its aviation security policy and invest in what actually works in terms of preventing terrorism. Getting caught up in the politics of privatization is another step backwards.

Airports No Longer Can "Opt Out" By Harriet Baskas View Comments ( ) | Email | Print NEWSLETTERS Receive the latest politics updates in your inbox Privacy Policy | More Newsletters Thank you for signing up! AP The TSA says no private screeners for you. Thursday, Feb 3, 2011  Updated at 2:00 PM PDT The Transportation Security Administration has said it won’t allow any more airports to “opt out” and bring in private security contractors in place of the agency’s federal workers. Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., who in the fall wrote a letter to 100 airports urging them to ditch the TSA, said it is “unimaginable” that TSA would end “the most successfully performing passenger screening program we’ve had over the last decade.” Despite staunch opt-out support from Mica — the new chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee — TSA Administrator John Pistole said Friday that he had reviewed the private contractor screening program as part of a more general review of TSA policies and decided not to expand the program beyond the current 16 airports because he did not see “any clear or substantial advantage to do so at this time.”   In a statement, Mica said, "I intend to launch a full investigation and review of the matter.” Since the TSA was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, federal law has allowed airports the option of using private screeners. But few of the nation's roughly 460 commercial airports have done so. Currently, San Francisco International, Kansas City International and 14 other airports use private contractors to screen airline passengers. Under the program, the private company conducts an airport’s passenger screening according to TSA’s rules and policies and under TSA supervision. “TSA will continue to sustain the program at the current level to compare the effectiveness of federal vs. private screeners,” said TSA spokesperson Greg Soule. “The information we have to date shows the performance of TSA officers and private screeners is comparable.”   ‘Flabbergasted’ Several airports had been pursuing the use of private screeners. Gary Cyr, director of Missouri’s Springfield-Branson National Airport, said he was “flabbergasted” by the two-sentence TSA memo he received Friday letting him know that the airport’s application to “opt out” of the federal passenger screening program had been denied. “We got no response as to why, what for or otherwise,” said Cyr. “It’s the shortest important letter I ever got.” Five other airports — all in Montana — also were looking to use private security screeners and received the same response Friday from the TSA. “Basically it was a form letter saying that our application had been denied because there would be no benefit to TSA,” said Cindi Martin, director of Montana’s Glacier Park International Airport. Some government officials and unions representing TSA workers applauded Pistole's decision. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., a ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement that ending the acceptance of new applications for the program “makes sense from a budgetary and counterterrorism perspective.” “The nation is secure in the sense that the safety of our skies will not be left in the hands of the lowest-bidder contractor, as it was before 9/11,” said John Gage, president of the American Federation of Government Employee, in a statement. The union represents TSA screeners.   Mixed reaction Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which is actively organizing TSA officers at some airports, also thinks Pistole did the right thing. “It keeps this important work in the hands of federal employees, where it belongs,” Kelly said in a statement. But in Washington, D.C., where more than 200 airport staff members were attending a legislative conference, Greg Principato, president of Airports Council International–North America, said his organization opposes the TSA's stance. “Nobody here is happy about Pistole’s decision. Even airports that had no interest in opting out aren’t happy. They thought those airports that want the option should be able to pursue that.” Principato said he is keeping an eye on the 16 airports already in the program. “We didn’t think TSA would make the move to not let anyone else in. We hope they won’t expand on the mistake by shrinking the current program.”   Decisions, decisions In the meantime, several airports that were considering the screening partnership program are contemplating their next moves. “We still plan to opt out,” said Larry Dale, airport director at Orlando Sanford International in Florida, who planned to file his airport’s application this week. “My guess is they’ll send it back saying they’re not taking applications. But we’re taking advantage of something we’re allowed to do. We’re put too much time and investment into researching this not to go forward.” “We’re just not sure what to think at this point,” said Chris Jensen, airport director at Missoula International. “So we’re going to wait and watch.” Martin of Montana’s Glacier Park International Airport said her airport may re-apply. “The program is not dead. The reason our airport authority applied to the screening partnership program was because of TSA staffing cuts at our airport and customer service issue. Those issues still haven’t been resolved.” Information from The Associated Press was included in this report.

﻿ TSA halts private security screener program | Homeland Security News Wire Homeland Security News Wire Home About us Subscribe Advertise Contact RSS Feed BIOMETRICS BORDERS Business Cybersecurity Detection Disasters Government Immigration Infrastructure Public Safety Public health Sci-Tech Sector Reports Surveillance Transportation VC and PE TSA halts private security screener program Published 3 February 2011 Share | In an about face, the TSA has halted its private screening program at airports; last December the TSA declared that it was neutral on the program, however last Friday the TSA denied an airport in Missouri its request for private screeners and declared that it would reject all incoming proposals; Representative John Mica, a vocal advocate for the program, was shocked to hear of TSA’s new plan and promised to launch an investigation into the matter; currently less than twenty airports use private security screeners The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recently announced that it was halting its program that allowed airports to opt out of TSA screeners and use private security contractors instead. This comes as a surprise to many, as the program recently received heightened attention due to increased anger over TSA’s enhanced pat-down procedures. TSA administrator John Pistole said, in statement, that he “examined the contractor screening program and decided not to expand the program beyond the current 16 airports as I do not see any clear or substantial advantage to do so at this time.” A month ago, the agency said that it was “neutral” on the program. Representative John Mica (R- Florida), the new chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has been a particularly vociferous advocate for the private security screening program. Last December Mica sent roughly 200 airports letters encouraging them to switch from TSA screeners to private contractors. In the past, he has also stated that, “The private screening under federal supervision works and performs statistically, significantly better. So our main purpose here is in getting better screening and better performance, not to mention that we can get better cost for the taxpayers.” In response to Mica’s calls for expanded private contractors, a TSA spokesman declared last December that, “If airports chose this route, we are going to work with them to do it.” In an about face, last Friday, the TSA denied a regional airport in Missouri its request for private screeners. Pistole noted that other applications would be similarly rejected. After hearing of the TSA’s new policy, Mica lashed out at the organization promising to launch an investigation into the matter. Mica said “It’s unimaginable that TSA would suspend the most successfully performing passenger screening program we’ve had over the last decade.” He added, “Nearly every positive security innovation since the beginning of TSA has come from the contractor screening program.” While Mica points to the efficacy of the private screening program, government analysis shows similar results from both TSA employees and private contractors. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found that it “did not notice any difference” between the two programs during covert checkpoint testing in 2007. The GAO concluded that both failed to find concealed bomb components. The private screening program is run entirely by the TSA, hiring, training, and paying private contractors. Advocates of the private screening program say that because they are private companies, they can hold their employees accountable thereby improving a passenger’s experience. According to NPR, less than twenty airports around the United States use private security screeners including Kansas City, San Francisco, and Jackson Hole.

As Congress tried to fix airport security after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a debate raged over who could do the job better: government workers or private business. Related News/Archive TSA officials warn of credit card knives at airports 3 Weeks Ago TSA opens new precheck enrollment center at Tampa International 2 Months Ago Tampa International Airport gets stellar marks for quality, service during renovations 5 Months Ago Uncle Sam won with the creation of the Transportation Security Administration in 2001. But a little-known provision of the law opened the door for airports to choose private security companies to screen passengers under TSA oversight. Just as dozens of airports — including Tampa International — were looking into the option, TSA Administrator John Pistole slammed the door shut late Friday. In a brief statement, Pistole said he reviewed the program and decided not to expand it beyond the 16 airports that now use private companies. "I do not see any clear or substantial advantage to do so at this time," he said. Orlando Sanford International Airport was ready to file its application for the agency's Screening Partnership Program, said Diane Crews, vice president of administration for the airport. "We're still planning to do that. If they deny it, we'll deal with that." Tampa International staffers will continue with a detailed review for the airport board, CEO Joe Lopano said. "At this moment, we have not found any operational or customer service benefit for us to go private," he said. At the direction of their boards, staffers at Orlando International and Sarasota-Bradenton International researched the experience of other airports with private contractors at security checkpoints. Orlando officials flew to San Francisco International to observe the largest airport in the program. "Now, we're in a holding pattern," said Orlando International spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell. At St. Petersburg-Clearwater International, director Noah Lagos isn't interested in making a change. "We have a very good relationship with TSA," he said. "They're flexible, courteous and do a good job." One of the TSA's most strident critics, U.S. Rep. John Mica, R-Winter Park, pledged to investigate why the agency abruptly changed positions. In December, a spokesman said the TSA would work with airports interested in the program. "It's unimaginable that TSA would suspend the most successfully performing passenger screening program we've had," he said. "The agency should concentrate on cutting some of the more than 3,700 administrative personnel in Washington … and reduce the army of TSA employees that have ballooned to more than 62,000." Mica, who helped write the law that created the TSA, sent letters to 100 of the busiest U.S. airports in November urging officials to ditch the agency and go with private security companies. The pitch arrived during widespread public criticism of whole-body scanning machines and aggressive new patdown searches at checkpoints. But passengers at airports without TSA screening don't just breeze though checkpoints. Private companies must follow all agency procedures and use the same equipment to look inside bags and underneath clothes for weapons. Airports also don't save money. The TSA hires, manages and pays the contractors. Costs vary, but private screening contracts cost the government 3 to 9 percent more than government workers, the TSA says. Pay for security officers is "very, very close to the feds', " said Gerry Berry, president of Covenant Aviation Security in Winter Springs, located in Mica's congressional district. His company has screening contracts at San Francisco International; Tupelo, Miss.; Sioux Falls, S.D.; and some small Montana airports. So why are airports so interested in turning over the checkpoints to private security companies? While government employees can be hard to fire, private contractors can remove poor performers quickly, Mark Van Loh, director of aviation for the Kansas City (Mo.) Aviation Department, told MSNBC.com. It's easier to reach the private company, too. "Because I'm a client, I get a return call immediately," Van Loh said. Berry said his worker attendance rate is higher and attrition rate lower than at TSA. "You have to come to work wearing a long-sleeve shirt and tie, and you have to be good with the public," he said.

Suspicious items detected by the scanner appear as little boxes outlined in red, showing their location on generic front and back silhouettes on the screen. Passengers who trigger an alert, and anyone who refuses to go through the scanners, will receive the rigorous frisking that has drawn sharp objections. The new software is expected to debut soon at Reagan National Airport and in Atlanta. If it does as well in the field as it has in testing, it could be installed in the 486 scanners now in use at 78 major airports, the Transportation Security Administration said. "We believe it addresses the privacy issues that have been raised," said John Pistole, head of the TSA. "It's basically a software modification to existing equipment, so there's very little cost." Robin Kane, who heads the TSA's technology office, said that once the less-invasive approach is proved effective, then the controversial monitors, on which a TSA officer reviews scans in a private screening room, will be removed from all airports. The images produced by the current software led to an uproar over privacy concerns. Pistole had said in the fall that he wanted to see modifications, but the technology that was being tested yielded too many false positives. Many passengers found the alternative "enhanced" pat-downs by TSA agents even more disturbing. In the demonstration at National on Tuesday, "passengers" filed through the scanner, some of them producing gray silhouettes with green "OK" screens, others producing silhouettes with boxes noting where the machine detected something hidden. Kate Hanni, founder of the California-based group FlyersRights, called the new software "a great step forward." "We're grateful to the TSA for addressing these issues that were of concern to so many people," Hanni said. "But privacy was our secondary issue. Our primary concern about the body scanners is that they are ineffective. We're also concerned about the possibility of surges in radiation." Two types of scanning machines - backscatter and millimeter wave - have been installed at airports. Both machines produce the kind of full-body images that attracted controversy; they work by bouncing X-rays or radio waves off skin or concealed objects.

Photos Deals Search Travel Search USA TODAY GO TSA unveils 'generic' body scans By Roger Yu, USA TODAY Updated Comments Reprints & Permissions The Transportation Security Administration began testing on Tuesday new software that will transmit more modest images of travelers' bodies on some of its controversial airport screening machines.

Enlarge Close By Julie Jacobson, AP A Transportation Security Administration employee is screened using new software Tuesday in Las Vegas. Sponsored Links The new technology, introduced at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport for a 45- to 60-day trial, is designed to detect potential explosives and show them on a blurred "generic outline" of a person projected a monitor that can be seen by screeners and travelers. The outline will be identical for all passengers. The TSA will introduce the software at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International and Ronald Reagan Washington National in the next few days. "Testing this new software will help us confirm test results that indicate it can provide the same high level of security as current advanced imaging technology units while further enhancing the privacy protections already in place," TSA Administrator John Pistole said. Tests on the software — which is only for scanners that use wave technology and not X-ray machines — come after an outcry and a failed boycott last year by travelers who complained the machines present a graphic, naked image of them on a screen viewed by TSA security personnel. MUSLIMS: Body scanners violate Islamic law SCANNER MAKERS: Lobbying cash doubled over 5 years Nearly 500 scanners that can peer through clothing with wave or X-ray technology have been installed at 78 airports nationwide. Travelers who refuse to pass through them must undergo pat-down searches. Body scanners Airports with full-body scanning machines that use wave-imaging technology: Albuquerque Atlanta Baltimore/Washington Cleveland Chicago Midway Denver Dallas/Fort Worth Dayton Detroit Metro Fort Wayne Fresno Harrisburg Honolulu Houston Bush and Hobby Indianapolis Jacksonville Los Angeles/Ontario Las Vegas Melbourne Miami Milwaukee Minneapolis/St. Paul Nashville Newark Liberty New Orleans Palm Beach Palm Springs Philadelphia Raleigh-Durham Richmond Rochester, N.Y. Washington National Sarasota Bradenton St. Petersburg-Clearwater San Francisco Salt Lake City Tampa Toledo Tulsa Source: TSA The wave machines project radio frequency energy in millimeter waves over the body to produce the image. The TSA said it hopes to test similar technology for the machines that use X-ray technology in the near future. The TSA, which has been testing the software internally since fall, said it hopes to placate the public and improve worker efficiency. Currently, a TSA screener has to sit in a booth to watch the private body images. The screener then radios the operator of the machine in the screening line with the scan's findings. If the software works properly, the TSA will be able to remove personnel from the private booths. Travelers identified by the software as carrying potential threats will require additional screening. If no threat items are detected, an "OK" will appear on the monitor. Allowing travelers to see the monitor will give the public "greater confidence" in the system and serve as a deterrent, Pistole said. Pistole told Congress last year TSA has had problems with false-positive alarms in software testing. But he told reporters Tuesday that they've been eliminated at "a sufficient level." "We've applied rigorous standards," he said, without elaborating. Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said the software is "a filtering technique" that does little to eliminate privacy concerns. "The bigger news may be the decision to drop the plan for remote viewing. And keep in mind that filters can be enabled and disabled by the operator. Perhaps TSA will place 'no peeking' signs over the display screen." For more information about reprints & permissions, visit our FAQ's.
