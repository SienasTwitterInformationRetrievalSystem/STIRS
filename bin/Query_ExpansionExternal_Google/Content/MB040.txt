We urge News Corporation to ask Mr. Beck to refrain from a form of demagoguery that not only undermines the free and honest exchange of ideas, but that also threatens Professor Piven's safety. This type of behavior by Mr. Beck, while not new, is especially troubling in the wake of the tragic shootings in Tucson, AZ, where a nine-year-old child and five other individuals were murdered and thirteen others wounded, including a member of the House of Representatives. While the rest of the nation is engaged in a conversation to reduce the violent rhetoric which Mr. Beck's attacks engender, Mr. Beck continues on the attack and even mocks threats made on Dr. Piven's life and other attacks posted on the internet and sent to her via e-mail. No one invites or enjoys spirited debate more than Dr. Piven, but the debate must be honest and responsible, and free from personal attacks, that when launched are typically an indicator that an individual does not have a valid argument; something Mr. Beck lacks in this case. But even if he had a valid argument, the manner in which he is making it should be unacceptable in any free society, let alone by a network that claims to be "fair and balanced." For once, we urge Fox News to live up to its motto.   A. Javier Treviño, SSSP President Wheaton College Hèctor L.

Hess Memorial Scholarship Racial/Ethnic Minority Graduate Scholarship Award & Scholarship Winners Special Problems Divisions The Special Problems Divisions Roles and Responsibilities of Division Chairs Paper Competitions and Scholarship Awards Selected Highlights of the Rightwing Attack on Frances Fox Piven (v.4) January 31, 2011 Lori Minnite This is not a comprehensive guide to the rightwing political attack on Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward.  There are thousands and thousands of hostile blog postings, reader comments, articles, etc. on the Internet that collectively reflect the effectiveness of this attack.  And keep in mind, there is a much longer back-story.  It begins in the beginning, in the 1960s, and was and is significantly shaped by people who started out on the left (i.e., David Horowitz, Ron Radosh, Fred Siegel, Jim Sleeper). First, for a good summary of what’s been going on over the last year, see two stories by Peter Dreier in the Huffington Post.  The first, “The Right’s Conspiracy Theory Attack on Frances Fox Piven,” appeared, March 23, 2010.  Not all the links still work, but check out WorldnetDaily editor Joseph Farah’s diatribe against the so-called “Cloward-Piven Strategy” at the February 2010 Tea Party convention in Nashville. The second piece, “Glenn Beck’s Attacks on Frances Fox Piven Trigger Death Threats,” appeared January 23, 2011, and brings the story up-to-date. If there is any question about Piven being targeted by Tea Party activists, see this video of Kyle Olson trashing teachers’ and public employees’ unions at a Lansing, Michigan Tea Party rally on April 15, 2010, sponsored by David Koch’s Americans for Prosperity.  Olson is the young man who last year deliberately lied to Piven about his identity, claiming to be a college student who had read one of her books and wanted to interview her for a term paper.  She welcomed him into her home while she was recuperating from a car accident – she was alone - he filmed the interview under false pretenses, and then posted snippets along with mocking and hostile commentary on Andrew Breitbart’s website, www.biggovernment.com (see Olson’s postings on February 8th,  February 9th, and February 10th, 2010).  Despite Peter Dreier’s exposure of Olson as a fraud, he continues to attack, harass and mock Piven in his online postings (Olson posted attacks on Piven on Breitbart’s site on April 2, April 28, and September 21, 2010).  The Olson story is detailed in the 2010 Huffington Post article by Dreier cited above.  The current rightwing political attack on Piven is easily traced to David Horowitz, who details what he presents as the nefarious origins of the “Cloward-Piven Strategy” in his 2006 book, written with Richard Poe, The Shadow Party: How George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and Sixties Radicals Seized Control of the Democratic Party.  Don’t waste your money buying the book, you can get a good sense of the arc of the myth by searching the book on Amazon (use “piven” as the search term).  Horowitz offers warmed-over old news, and for most of the last six years, the far Right has only repeated the story over and over again, adding nothing to the myth of the Sixties radicals “collapsing” the system, and paying almost no attention to anything else written by Piven and Cloward.  According to Jim Sleeper, he is the source for Horowitz’s fable about Piven and Cloward bringing New York City to its knees in the 1970s.  The hysteria over the “Cloward-Piven Strategy for Orchestrated Crisis” is evident in the more than 200,000 hits for “cloward-piven” on Google. In other words, the propagandists created a myth and forgot that the central character was alive and well.  That changed with Piven’s January 10/17, 2011 Nation article, “Mobilizing the Jobless,” which outlined the obstacles to organizing the unemployed.  On December 30, 2010, Ron Radosh posted “The Second Time is Farce: Frances Fox Piven Calls for a new Cloward-Piven Strategy for Today” at the Pajamas Media blog.  Radosh’s piece ignited another firestorm of anger and hatred toward Piven.  But this time, the fire is being fanned by a vast and growing base of admirers of Glenn Beck who over the last several years have been indoctrinated by him into believing in the inherent (“Communist”) evil of “Cloward-Piven.”  According to Dreier, over the course of the last two years, Beck has mentioned Piven and Cloward on his Fox News show about 50 times.   Piven and Cloward have long been attacked politically as ideologues working for “system collapse,” such as when Jim Sleeper in his 1990 book, The Closest of Strangers, argued that they promoted racial polarization and a “radical extension of welfare” in the late 1960’s that ultimately “routed” New York City’s “unique civic culture.”  It is important to note that the current escalation of the assault on Piven by Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes’ Fox News coincides with the election of the nation’s first African American president, the collapse of the housing market, and a brutal recession – all of which have been blamed on Piven and her putative strategy for “orchestrated crisis.”  In the acid, vitriolic political environment of the last two years, with people really going off the rails in blind rage and anger at the government, the rhetoric against Piven has now turned deadly. Radosh’s blog got the attention of Jonathon Siedl, an editor of Glenn Beck’s phony news website, The Blaze.  This article is titled, “Frances Fox Piven Rings in The New Year By Calling for Violent Revolution.”  The appendix contains a selection of comments posted to this one story that discuss the various ways Piven should die or be killed.  It was this compendium of recent threats and a January 20, 2010 letter to Roger Ailes from the Center of Constitutional Rights on behalf of Piven demanding that he intervene to stop Beck’s misinformation campaign that brought media attention to Piven’s story.  The appendix also was provided to state and federal law enforcement authorities to ensure Piven’s safety and determine whether crimes have been committed.  Since CCR’s letter, some of the more graphic threats and comments have been removed from Beck’s website. But the rightwing echo chamber hasn’t stopped reverberating and instead, after the January 8, 2011, massacre in Tucson, the campaign against Piven has only ratcheted up violent rhetoric.  Piven herself is now routinely referred to as an “advocate of violence,” and an “enemy of the Constitution.”  For example, Matthew Vadum, an acolyte of Horowitz and chief propagandist in the recent rightwing political campaign to destroy the community organization ACORN, is a frequent promoter of hate toward Piven.  Vadum claims he first brought Piven and Cloward to the attention of Glenn Beck (see the video Vadum uploaded to Youtube of his performance on Glenn Beck’s May 13, 2009 television show at).  His most recent contribution accuses Piven of trying to “[murder] America’s constitutional legacy of limited government,” of “[generating] chaos,” and “[inflicting] a lot of damage on the nation.” In fact, at least one blogger has blamed the Tucson massacre on Piven.  The day after the shootings, in a blog entry title, “Liberals Predictably ‘Alinsky’ the Giffords Shooting,” Angry White Dude wrote, “The blame for yesterday’s violence should be placed at the feet of Frances Fox Piven and not Sarah Palin.” And Glenn Beck is now escalating his campaign of misinformation, exhorting his followers to take a pledge to denounce “violent threats and calls for the destruction of our system – regardless of their underlying ideology – whether they come from the Hutaree Militia or Frances Fox Piven.” On his January 17, 2011 show he called Piven an “enemy of the Constitution” and equated her call for a new social movement to organize the unemployed with “terrorism.” Anti-Semitism has not been a strong theme in the hate-filled vitriol directed at Piven.  Perhaps Beck and his audience do not know that Piven is Jewish.  Perhaps people like Horowitz and Radosh who are also Jewish, do not have the inclination to turn to Anti-Semitism to smear her or whip up the mob against her.   On the other hand, on his January 14, 2011 show, Beck listed ten people who he said were major contributors to the 20th century “era of the big lie.”  Nine of these people, including Frances Fox Piven (for “sowing the seeds of revolution”) are Jewish.  See this MediaMatters report. Nevertheless, I’ve found at least one Anti-Semitic diatribe invoking “Cloward-Piven” titled, “The New Weimar Republic,” and posted by “Joy” on July 25, 2009, on a website called Sojourner of the Cesspit: “At the dawn of the “civil rights” move­ment, and just before the so-called “Sex­ual Rev­o­lu­tion” of the 1960’s, the Jew Alan Gins­burg wrote a col­lec­tion of so-called poetry which was greatly lauded by all of the Jew­ish media and acad­e­mia. It con­tains mate­r­ial such as: “I’m with you Rock­land where you accuse your doc­tors of insan­ity and plot the Hebrew social­ist rev­o­lu­tion against the fas­cist national Gol­go­tha” (from Howl). What garbage is praised by the Jews as art! To Gins­burg, Chris­tian­ity (“Gol­go­tha”) and nation­al­ism are both evil, and these are what he is rail­ing against. A gen­er­a­tion of Jews fol­lowed suit, and the Jew­ish media has praised all of them glow­ingly ever since, openly wor­ship­ping dev­ils while the aver­age Amer­i­can stares blindly at the tele­vi­sion screen, get­ting his daily dose of “enter­tain­ment”. While Gins­burg may appeal to the basest sorts in soci­ety, this same men­tal­ity exists through­out acad­e­mia. For instance: “Barack Obama is Destroy­ing Our Econ­omy on Pur­pose … A pair of rad­i­cal Colum­bia Uni­ver­sity pro­fes­sors by the name of Richard Andrew Cloward and Frances Fox Piven wrote an arti­cle in the rad­i­cal mag­a­zine known as The Nation. The arti­cle was pub­lished on May 2, 1966 and laid out what is now known as the ‘Cloward-Piven Strat­egy’. The plan calls for the destruc­tion of cap­i­tal­ism in Amer­ica by swelling the wel­fare rolls to the point of col­laps­ing our econ­omy and then imple­ment­ing social­ism by nation­al­iz­ing many pri­vate insti­tu­tions. Cloward and Piven stud­ied Saul Alin­sky just like Hillary Clin­ton and … Obama” (Quoted from worldviewradio.com). It should be quite evi­dent why ever since the “Great Soci­ety” speech given by Lyn­don John­son, this nation has sunk deeper and deeper into social­ism, which is noth­ing but a euphemism for Marx­ism. These early state­ments, and the fact that this nation has obvi­ously fol­lowed this path laid out by so many Jews, makes it no coin­ci­dence why we have done so.” Beck’s Anti-Semitism is now receiving attention from the mainstream media (see Dana Milbank, “Glenn Beck vs. the Rabbis” in the Washington Post, January 28, 2011) and Jewish religious leaders from across the political spectrum.

TRENDING For-Profit Colleges Students Legal Leadership The Profession February 1, 2011 by Peter Schmidt AAUP President Says Glenn Beck’s Scholar Bashing Verges on ‘American Fatwa’ Cary Nelson, the University of Illinois professor who is president of the American Association of University Professors, has issued a statement arguing that a City University of New York professor has become the victim of “what nearly amounts to an American Fatwa” as a result of “virulent attacks” directed at her by Glenn Beck, the conservative Fox News commentator. The statement suggests that Mr. Beck’s “relentless tirades” against Frances Fox Piven, whom the TV personality has called “an enemy of the Constitution” and accused of trying to incite violent revolution, have led his followers to direct anonymous threats of violence at the professor of political science and sociology at CUNY’s Graduate Center. The statement calls for those who take issue with Ms. Piven’s writings “to advance their positions in ways that foster responsible criticism and debate.” But Robert Corn-Revere, a leading First Amendment lawyer who advises the Media Institute, on Tuesday said Mr. Nelson’s statement was likely to just add fuel to the fire. There is “a certain irony in complaining about inflammatory rhetoric and then describing it as an American Fatwa,” Mr. Corn-Revere said. Return to Top Bookmark the permalink.

The Reality-Based Community Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts. Home About MJ Legalization News Marijuana Monitor BOTEC Analysis You are here: Home / Frances Fox Piven Frances Fox Piven January 31, 2011 By Harold Pollack Frances Fox Piven has been singled out for taunting by Glenn Beck and others. This vitriol has predictably elicited all manner of violent talk, whose bullying depravity is only magnified by their being directed against a 78-year-old woman. It goes without saying that such things exceed the bounds of Democratic politics. And the sheer disproportion of the right-wing response would be funny if it weren’t so creepy. Piven’s articles in The Nation have as much chance of inciting national unrest as another distinguished professor, Louis DeBranges, did in this incident a quarter-century ago. Yet what about Piven herself, and her Nation essay, “mobilizing the jobless” that prompted such fuss? For five decades, she has sought to address one of the central puzzles and problems of American democratic politics: Why aren’t the jobless and the poor more organized, more angry, and more effective in pressing their claims during fairly catastrophic economic times. And how could one change that? In answering these challenges, did the veteran activist and scholar herself exceed the bounds of democratic politics ? On this, my friends and colleagues seem to disagree. In part, their disagreements reflect ambiguities in Piven’s own writings. These disagreements also reflect real differences among friends in political sensibility and strategy. Piven plants her flag near the boundary that separates liberal reformism and parts further left. Her writings suggest that incremental reformers are too ready to accept the fact that our nation’s nominally democratic political process repeatedly, predictably yield painful defeats for our most marginalized citizens. I’m a committed incrementalist myself. Yet there are moral and political costs to this stance that should be acknowledged. Read her latest article for yourself, and draw your own conclusions. The key offending passage seems to be this one: Local protests have to accumulate and spread—and become more disruptive—to create serious pressures on national politicians. An effective movement of the unemployed will have to look something like the strikes and riots that have spread across Greece in response to the austerity measures forced on the Greek government by the European Union, or like the student protests that recently spread with lightning speed across England in response to the prospect of greatly increased school fees. I don’t read this essay or this passage as advocating violence, or anything close to it. Instead, Piven offers a fairly traditional left analysis of obstacles to collective political action, She notes that apathy, disorganization, ethnic division, and of course poverty itself, pose serious obstacles. It is very hard to mobilize disorganized, diverse, dispirited or disaffected jobless people on behalf of a coherent political agenda. Piven does carelessly include the words “and riots.” She should have supplied some missing sentences to make plain the obvious truth that violence and mayhem are morally and strategically crazy in American democratic politics. That was a mistake. I believe it was an innocent one. Piven claims that we would get better public policy if fifteen million jobless people could wage more effective, perhaps even disruptive protest to ensure that their needs are being met. If one makes explicit the political and moral requirement of nonviolence within this story, this is a respectable position that deserves a seious hearing. Consider, for example, Larry Bartels’ impressive evidence that the voting behavior of American politicians is strikingly unresponsive to poor people’s political preferences. I have no doubt that Representatives and Senators are saddened by the job crisis and by foreclosures. They still demonstrate a striking lack of urgency that mirrors the striking powerless and disorganization of those near the bottom of the income scale. Imagine if individual legislators felt the same immediate and specific pressure to fix (say) foreclosures occurring within the troubled HAMP program or to provide inner-city youth summer jobs that many politicians feel to fix the 1099 problem in health reform or Medicare’s “Doctor fix.” Imagine if Senators voted on whether to extend unemployment insurance knowing that a negative vote might produce angry mass protest, maybe even a sit-down demonstration that delays travelers at Reagan National Airport. This last example of direct action makes many liberals uncomfortable. It should. Its conduct and purposes touch some ambiguities in Piven’s account. If the goal of such action is to create sufficient havoc that politicians surrender to the angry minority, I would oppose it. That kind of vanguard politics is neither safe nor workable in American society. In any event, poor people’s movements lack the power these days to coerce anybody, unless their claims attract broader and more conventional political support. Welfare rights activists of the late 1960s and early 1970s sometimes forgot this reality. Misconceived efforts to mobilize poor people were occasionally de facto Nixon campaign commercials. Piven herself has a checkered record when it comes to anticipating and defusing the powerful backlash politics her recommended strategies surely provoke. This strategic reality provides powerful incentive for restraint. There is no shortcut to winning elections, which means ultimately persuading people near the middle of the American electorate. That’s a good thing, too. I take it as a given that democratic political movements succeed through persuasion, not coercion. I believe that Piven takes this as given, too. As the Nation’s editors observe, she has spent her career organizing voter registration drives, grassroots organizing, and “when necessary,” street protest. In 2011 America, mass protest is no alternative to reformist politics. It is a mechanism to improve this reformist politics: to stiffen the backbones of wavering sympathetic office-holders, to press Democratic politicians hard from their base to do more, to embolden and empower those who feel left out to join organized conventional politics. One might argue that the absence of such a movement has undermined several recent Democratic efforts, and worsened the outcome in last year’s midterms. Such tactics are familiar to Republicans, as the success of the Tea Party movement attests. I oppose the Tea Party’s substantive agenda and some its members’ specific actions and rhetoric. Yet the broad enterprise bears ironic similarity to what Piven seeks. In its way, Piven’s reach to Greece and Italy is telling. No one is quite sure what a successful American movement to mobilize the poor would really look like. I suspect that such a movement would look quite different from what Piven has in mind: probably a little quieter and a little less threatening in its public face. Not by accident, plainspoken Midwesterner Elizabeth Warren is the most successful economic populists these days. Mass protest and civil disobedience inevitably raise tough issues. Democratic citizens cannot regard every unpalatable, misguided, or even unjust policy outcome as illegitimate. Given the reality of disagreement in a pluralist society, everyone is obliged to accept tough political losses that were produced through a flawed but basically legitimate process. We ask the same of others, for example when liberals demand that social conservatives honor legal rulings furthering abortion rights, or when meat eaters and cancer patients demand that animal rights activists not disrupt key activities that harm animals for human benefit. Across the spectrum, there are nasty anti-democratic strains in activist politics that should be resisted. Mobilization through anger at specific policies is often warranted. One must be wary when that anger leads people to demonize specific people. Anti-abortion folks are entitled to show gross fetal pictures or to shout in a bullhorn across the street from an abortion clinic. Activists are not entitled to print the home addresses of abortion clinic staff, or, for that matter, the address of some tobacco company executive or the CEO of a crooked military contractor. Which brings us back to Piven’s tormentors, and to the journalists who would channel such rage Piven’s way. Whatever the alleged sins in her writings, there is no excuse for the way she has been taunted and singled out. There is equally no excuse for a national network that continues to give people airtime to spread this stuff. Filed Under: Uncategorized Tagged With: Income distribution, Liberalism, Rhetoric and Framing Comments Mark Kleiman says January 31, 2011 at 3:32 pm If Piven added the words "and riots" carelessly, rather than advisedly, it would be nice to hear her say so. When someone who writes for a living writes in praise of rioting, the natural assumption is that she intends to praise rioting. If she did so intend, neither her age nor her sex ought to immunize her from criticism. Of course Beck's rants are over the top. Aren't they always? And of course threats of violence directed at Piven are cowardly and inexcusable. But those of us who would like to see poor people get a better break, and who nevertheless think that rioting is a bad way to go about it, shouldn't act as if opposing Beckism requires supporting Piven when the plain meaning of her words is an endorsement of political violence. Curmudgeon says January 31, 2011 at 4:16 pm Given the reality of disagreement in a pluralist society, everyone is obliged to accept tough political losses that were produced through a flawed but basically legitimate process. For many decades in America, slavery and segregation was the law of the land as the specific result of legislation passed by a governmental system that the majority of the US population considered legitimate. Were slaves and black American citizens obliged to accept the 'tough political losses' in the 3/5ths compromise or the ex-confederate states' segregation laws because these instruments were enacted according to a largely legitimate political process? If you answer 'yes,' then you are endorsing some form of legal authoritarianism completely divorced from any moral basis. If you answer 'no,' then you are accepting that the substantive content–and not just the process of enactment–of political decisions has a role in determining whether they are legitimate. There are definite limits to the moral validity of arguments based on legal positivism in the context of procedurally valid political decisions that abridge–by acts of commission or omission–the ability of all citizens to participate in a pluralist society. The obligation upon a class to abide by the decisions of the polity at large is conditional on having a voice in making those decisions. It is a social contract that imposes requirements both upon individual classes (and individuals) and the remainder of the polity. Any class that has been systemically denied its political voice has been defrauded by the polity at large and is under no obligation to fulfill its half of the social contract. It is very hard to justify an argument that classes–such as slaves and the working poor–which are systemically exploited and systemically denied all redress are under any obligation to abide by the political rules of their oppressors. Bruce Wilder says January 31, 2011 at 5:15 pm "Activists are not entitled to print the home addresses of abortion clinic staff, or, for that matter, the address of some tobacco company executive or the CEO of a crooked military contractor." I can see why we might like to have a kind of mutually observed truce, where everyone considers this kind of behavior out of bounds, but we do not, actually, have such a truce in American politics. In the absence of such a truce, activists are "entitled" to print home addresses of abortion clinic staff and crooked contractors. It's not an "ironic symmetry" — it is an unfortunate fact of political life, circa 2011. "Of course Beck’s rants are over the top. Aren’t they always? And of course threats of violence directed at Piven are cowardly and inexcusable." Of course. Of course. I thought Harold Pollack's essay quite thoughful, but he doesn't seem to want to think the thoughts he's clearing thinking. Me, too. Brett Bellmore says January 31, 2011 at 8:31 pm "I don’t read this essay or this passage as advocating violence, or anything close to it." Given the nature of the Greek riots she writes approvingly of, I'm at a loss for why you don't. "Piven does carelessly include the words “and riots.” She should have supplied some missing sentences to make plain the obvious truth that violence and mayhem are morally and strategically crazy in American democratic politics. That was a mistake. I believe it was an innocent one." Her writings don't mean what she actually wrote, because she should have written something different? Seriously, that's your defense? "Such tactics are familiar to Republicans, as the success of the Tea Party movement attests. I oppose the Tea Party’s substantive agenda and some its members’ specific actions and rhetoric. Yet the broad enterprise bears ironic similarity to what Piven seeks." Except, you know, for the overturning and setting fire to cars part, and that junk. I'm with Mark, doesn't happen often, but there you are. She wrote what she wrote, she's not being misinterpreted, she's just unhappy the wrong people read it, and shared it with the wrong people. Ebenezer Scrooge says January 31, 2011 at 8:43 pm If Piven is being prescriptive, I have to agree with Mark and Brett: riots are wrong, and should not be advocated. If Piven is being descriptive–eh. I'm old enough to remember the riots of the mid-late 1960's. They actually did make the politicians pay attention to the problem of of the poor. I'm a bit surprised that Brett is anti-riot. He is strongly pro-gun, and I think supports a right to revolution (or some form of armed self-defense against a repressive state). The '60's riots were soft-core revolution. EB says January 31, 2011 at 10:38 pm The working poor (I've been one of them) do have redress; we just don't use it as effectively as the rich use theirs. Let's face it, those whom we elected for the past dozen years did not see, and did not protect us from, the dangers of an overheated housing market and financial wrongdoing on Wall Street. Those on the bottom are bearing the brunt of the fallout. That said, Frances Fox Piven (whose efforts to encourage organizing and involvement of the poor and working poor I totally admire and support) is something of a romantic. Riots do get the attention of elected officials (and everyone else) in the US. But the results have not been substantial, and partly because the rioters are not usually an organized group that persists in its efforts. They have not had significant redistributive effects, and in fact the mass demonstrations that have had an impact on US policy have almost all been about civil rights or war, not about economic issues. Bux says January 31, 2011 at 10:57 pm Speaking of attacking old ladies, remember the kind words that we are treated to via the Huffington Post upon Nancy Reagan's hospitalization for a fall? We heard such peaceful phrases such as "Like her evil husband she has lived far too long..Here's hoping the Hag suffers for several weeks then croaks in the tub." JO'N says January 31, 2011 at 11:27 pm So, Bux, do you have a link to the Huffington Post for that comment? In any case, Bux, are you seriously comparing a single crank comment (probably by a wingnut provocateur, if it's even a real quote at all) on the Huffington Post website to Glenn Back's nightly hour-long news network show? Ebenezer Scrooge says January 31, 2011 at 11:47 pm JO'N: You're right, of course. But please do not feed the trolls. Benjamin says February 1, 2011 at 12:06 am Piven's theories are largely discredited among contemporary (non-78-year-old) sociologists, which puts them in a strange position when having to defend her against Beck's lynch mobs. She wrote what she wrote not because she was careless but because she was wrong, which she's entitled to be without receiving death threats. drkrick says February 1, 2011 at 12:50 am I'm not really interested in hearing whining about Piven's (foolish) use of "and riots" from anyone who didn't loudly denounce the actual physical intimidation of vote counters in the "Brooks Brothers riot." Intimidation, it's worth noting, not by the otherwise disenfranchised but by a good number of people destined for Federal appointments in the administration they put into office. Bruce Wilder says February 1, 2011 at 2:05 am Of course, if you've lost your job, your pension and your house to the the pro-genitors of the global financial crisis, none of that was "violent" or politically illegitimate. Only your potential protest is an issue. And, of course, it has all been exclusively, a Republican plot; the Obama whose response to the foreclosure crisis was HAMP, a program to aid banks in stringing the victims along — well, he's a Democrat, so his viciousness doesn't count. Brett Bellmore says February 1, 2011 at 3:39 pm Well, Bruce, unless you lost your job at the hands of somebody wielding a lead pipe, or something of that nature, it wasn’t violent. “Violence” actually has a meaning, you know; Not everything you find objectionable is “violent”, and doubtless many things you approve of ARE violent. Bruce Wilder says February 1, 2011 at 8:22 pm @Brett Was there something ambiguous in my statement, “none of that was violent”? If you think something I approve of on this blog is violent, please bring it to my attention. Brett Bellmore says February 2, 2011 at 3:45 am “Was there something ambiguous in my statement, “none of that was violent”?” Just my mistaking that for sarcasm. “If you think something I approve of on this blog is violent, please bring it to my attention.” Ah, you’re an anarchist? Not really in favor of laws which will be enforced by dudes carrying truncheons and firearms, and not afraid to use them on folks who don’t go along with the policies you advocate? Well, then, you have my apology, you’re not approving of violence. Bruce Wilder says February 2, 2011 at 11:12 am @Brett I am not an anarchist, nor am I a pacifist. Anarchists are not, generally, pacifists, either, to my certain knowledge. “Not really in favor of laws which will be enforced by dudes carrying truncheons and firearms . . .” The contingent potential of state violence was an implicit condition in my earlier statements regarding the contrast between losing one’s job, pension and house, and protesting the same. The potential of state violence hangs over the loss of job, pension and house, just as much as it does over political protest. I believe the legitimacy of the state’s monopoly on violence rests on keeping state policy within both procedural and substantive boundaries. I took Professor Pollack’s post to be a meditation on what those boundaries are, and how those boundaries should be policed in a democratic society. Danny Adams says February 2, 2011 at 6:57 pm >>“Like her evil husband she has lived far too long..Here’s hoping the Hag suffers for several weeks then croaks in the tub.”<< When Bill O'Reilly singled this quote out on his show, I think he failed to point out that this came from a commenter, not a Huffington author. There are plenty of equally vicious comments on Fox News' site pages. As for supporting riots or not, I keep flashing back to Donald Rumsfeld saying "Democracy is messy".

In America, the artifact, Mark Sumner painted an incredible picture of a little-known failed expeditionary force in early America and what the cultures of native Americans were like before Europeans arrived. In Turning back Glenn Beck's attacks on Frances Fox Piven, Laura Clawson gave an overview of the academic's work, which has focused for decades on mobilizing the jobless and economic justice, clearly a threat to the Beck crowd. In Polling and Political Wrap, Steve Singiser restarted his round-up, this time in weekly format, to look at House races, the Senate picture, trends and Obama's current standing. In Bristol Palin, the wingnut welfare queen, Dante Atkins examined the hypocrisy of offering high speaker fees to America's most famous single teenage mother … to tell college students about the virtues of abstinence. In On gray hair and life, brooklynbadboy looked at the right-wing obsession with President Obama's hair color and used the topic as a springboard to discuss attitudes about aging and models of coping with the "halo" of gray.

Separate multiple keywords with commas. Tagging tips - Search For Tags - Browse For Tags ? More Tagging tips: A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find? Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office. If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race. Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful. Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: Civil Rights, Community, Congress, Culture, Economy, Education, Elections, Energy, Environment, Health Care, International, Labor, Law, Media, Meta, National Security, Science, Transportation, or White House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state (California, Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries that don't fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't. You can add a private note to this diary when hotlisting it: Are you sure you want to remove this diary from your hotlist? Are you sure you want to remove your recommendation?

Monday afternoon the Internet giant introduced a speak-to-tweet service that allows callers to tweet by calling one of three numbers and leaving a voicemail. The project is a collaboration between Google, Twitter and SayNow, which Google acquired just last week, according to the Google blog. The three numbers to call are +16504194196 or +390662207294 or +97316199855. The service instantly tweets what's said in the voicemail, and adds the hashtag #egypt. There's no internet connection necessary, and people can listen to the messages by dialing the same numbers or visiting twitter.com/speak2tweet. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...

Bush and his courageous invasion of Iraq.  Didn't the neocons predict that once we inplant Democracy in Iraq, democracy will spread throughout the Middle East?  (I remember Charles Krauthammer calling the Iraq invasion "our democracy project"). But if the Muslim brotherhood and Islamic radicals take over in a new dictatorship, and they break the peace treaty with Israel and start a war with Israel, then it will be just like Iran, when the fall of the Shah was all Jimmy Carter's fault, this will all be Obama's fault. When the Soviet Union was falling apart, they were denying it was happening, each Sunday we heard George Will intone how the Soviet Union is still a danger, the so-called changes are only surface deep, but when they couldn't deny any longer that the USSR had fallen apart, they took credit for it, and take credit for it to this day.
