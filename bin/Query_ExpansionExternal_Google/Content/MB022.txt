Feb. 1, 2011 | 10:30 a.m. EST + More By Nina Mandell DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER President Obama's health care overhaul took what could be another judicial blow Monday when a federal judge in Florida ruled a key part of it unconstitutional. The ruling applies mainly to the part of the legislation that requires people to buy health insurance by 2014 or face fines. With the ruling, Judge Roger Vinson, a Republican appointee, accepted the argument from the 26 states that filed the suit. The law, according to Vinson, was "outside Congress' Commerce Clause power and it cannot be otherwise authorized by an assertion of power under the Necessary and Proper Clause," the Wall Street Journal reported. [See a slide show of 10 ways the GOP can take down Obamacare.] While it's a small - and perhaps one of the most controversial parts of the legislation -the clause makes the entire law void, according to Vinson. The White house slammed the ruling as judicial overreach as the Justice Department said it would appeal. "We strongly disagree with the court's ruling today and continue to believe -- as other federal courts have found -- that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional," Stephanie Cutter, a senior advisor to the President, posted in a statement on the White House website. The ruling, which is considered the most high-profile in the numerous lawsuits filed against the new legislation, may not ever matter. The case is widely expected to go the Supreme Court. The Obama administration, however, did not have a complete washout day in court. [See a roundup of political cartoons on healthcare.] The states have also argued that the law's mandatory expansion of the Medicaid program commandeered states into federal service, but Vinson ruled with the federal government on that, arguing that states can leave Medicaid, Politico reported. The ruling isn't the end of the world for supporters of the legislation, according to experts. Even if that federal mandate is ruled unconstitutional in the likely Supreme Court case, states themselves could enforce a mandate on their own. In Massachusetts, a mandate stemming from Mitt Romney-led health care insurance has not been overturned by the courts. The Obama administration might not even have to go that route. Constitutional scholars have also argued that the individual mandate falls under the same powers that Congress uses to enforce taxation. While any effect from the latest court ruling, if any, will not go be seen for a long time, opponents of the health care act are lauding Vinson’s decision as a major victory. Sen. Orrin Hatch praised the ruling, saying "Congress does not have the legal authority to tell Utahns and other Americans that they must buy health insurance or else."

By Ron Bonjean Feb. 1, 2011 | 7:45 a.m. EST + More The Florida court’s ruling against Obamacare could be America’s new “Sputnik Moment.” First a federal judge in Virginia courts ruled in December that the individual mandate was unconstitutional. But when a Florida judge ruled that the entire healthcare law was unconstitutional, the confirmation came for millions of Americans and thousands of small businesses who employ them that they were justified in believing it had all gone too far. [See a slide show of 10 ways the GOP can take down Obamacare.] Politicians usually don’t know when they overreach until it happens. The Obama administration is still trying to define the law, writing the thousands of regulations that will soon be imposed on our nation. Americans voted for a Republican majority in November as a message that this madness should stop. Spending money that America doesn’t have, placing more burdens on employers who create jobs and requiring individuals to have insurance is not what the voters thought would happen after the 2008 election. Corporations, businesses, and associations are receiving special waivers so they won’t have to suffer the economic consequences from healthcare mandates. Even the AARP received special exemptions for the work it did to promote passage of the healthcare plan through Congress. [Check out a roundup of political cartoons on healthcare.] After Democrats lost the majority and President Obama shook up his staff, we thought he understood what America wanted from its elected officials. But we only had to wait a couple of months to see that the president hasn’t received the message. Before Obama delivered his State of the Union, I was providing commentary on C-SPAN’s pre-show, describing the pomp and circumstance around the affair. This was the Oscars of Washington. And at such a critical time in our nation’s history, he was expected to live up to delivering substantial positive changes. [Read the U.S. News debate: Should the healthcare law be repealed?] Like many political strategists, I pontificated that the president would politically move to the center on cutting spending and regulations, and emphasizing job creation. Instead, we heard more of the same tired spending rhetoric masked in creative language like spending on “investments.” He masked more energy regulations and a cap-and-trade scheme by talking of “clean energy.” Obama spoke of America being a place of innovation and that this was our Sputnik moment. [See editorial cartoons about Obama.] But our Sputnik moment isn’t something that America must create once again. Maybe it’s a moment when we stop the direction that we are dangerously headed towards. It could be an awakening by the other side that Obamacare must not only be changed, but be entirely eliminated. It could be the opportunity to tear up the government credit cards that House Speaker John Boehner says must be done. Many of us were disappointed that the State of the Union Address wasn’t the first step towards this, but now the Florida ruling against Obamacare could be the game changer.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size – + WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Florida said in a sweeping ruling yesterday that President Obama’s health care overhaul is unconstitutional because the government cannot force individuals to buy health insurance. The ruling, which backs a lawsuit brought by 26 states seeking to overturn the 2010 law, had been expected, and it represents the second ruling against the individual mandate. However, unlike a previous ruling in Virginia, which focused narrowly on the legality of the mandate, Judge Roger Vinson yesterday declared that the entire law should be struck down if higher courts confirm his opinion. “The act, like a defectively designed watch, needs to be redesigned and reconstructed by the watchmaker,’’ Vinson wrote. He ruled, however, that the law could remain in effect until appeals from the Obama administration are finished. That process is expected to take up to two years; most specialists anticipate that the US Supreme Court will be the final arbitrator. Vinson’s ruling was not a surprise. The judge, nominated for the federal bench in 1983 by President Reagan, a Republican, had hinted in earlier writings that the individual mandate has no precedent in US law. But the breadth of his ruling and the scope of the case, representing governors and attorneys general from more than half of the states, bolster its political significance. The ruling is a political setback for the Obama administration, which has been rolling out elements of the law even as it aggressively defends the overall package from a repeal attempt by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The House passed a repeal bill last month; Democratic leaders in the Senate have said they will let the repeal bill die without action. House Speaker John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, seized on the Florida ruling to pressure Democrats to act on the repeal legislation. “The House has passed legislation to do just that, and I hope Senate Democratic leaders will bring up the measure for an up-or-down vote,’’ Boehner said in a statement. The Tea Party movement, which made a priority of repealing the health care overhaul dubbed “Obamacare,’’ looked at the ruling as a positive step on the road to the Supreme Court. “We’ll be happy to see this law go and we look forward to the Supreme Court siding with the Constitution,’’ said Shelby Blakely, a spokeswoman for the national Tea Party Patriots , in an interview yesterday. The individual mandate, which will require most Americans to have medical insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty, is the heart of the health reform package, which is known as the Affordable Care Act. The mandate is designed to bring more young and healthy people into the insurance pool to help offset the costs of requiring insurance companies to cover everyone, even people with preexisting medical conditions. The judge ruled yesterday that the broadly interpreted commerce clause of the Constitution does not allow the Congress to require people to buy a specific product, in this case medical insurance. The ruling, like the one in Virginia, does not threaten the Massachusetts health care law, which also requires that residents buy health insurance. The ability of individual states to regulate commerce and impose tax penalties within their own borders is not in dispute. The Obama administration kicked into high gear to downplay the ruling. Senior administration officials called it an “outlier’’ riddled with weak reasoning that will not withstand appeal. The Department of Justice will appeal the ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, according to spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. “We strongly disagree with the court’s ruling . . . and continue to believe — as other federal courts have found — that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional.’’ Supporters of the health care law blasted the ruling. “This is judicial activism on steroids,’’ said Ethan Rome, director of Health Care for America Now, in a statement. “Fortunately, the US Supreme Court will have the final say . . . and it has corrected such lower-court mistakes when other major laws like Social Security, the minimum wage law, and the Voting Rights Act were passed.’’ Not all specialists believe the law is destined for the Supreme Court if the appeals courts side with the president. “I think that the court may be reluctant to interfere with a statute that will be so far implemented’’ by the time the circuit court appeals are done, said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor.

As the judge ruled in the Virginia case, Vinson held that Congress overstepped its authority by compelling nearly all Americans to be insured or pay a fine. But Vinson went further: Likening the law to "a finely crafted watch" in which "one essential piece is defective and must be removed," he ruled that the insurance mandate cannot be separated from the rest of the statute and therefore the entire law must be voided. "There are simply too many moving parts ... for me to try and dissect out ... the able-to-stand-alone from the unable-to-stand alone," he wrote. Even as he struck down the statute as a whole, Vinson rejected the plaintiffs' arguments against the part of the law that will expand Medicaid, the public insurance program for the poor and disabled that is jointly funded by the states and the federal government. The states contended that the expansion, to begin in 2014, infringes on their sovereignty. Vincent sided with the federal government, which argued that there is no infringement because states have the choice whether to participate in Medicaid. The Virginia case did not address the Medicaid issue. Still, the decision bolsters Republican efforts to overturn the law through the courts. All but one of the state officials who brought the suit are Republican. The case is one of 25 challenges that have been filed in federal courts since the law was enacted last March. Four suits have now been decided on their merits - two rulings upholding the law and, with Monday's decision, two finding all or part of it unconstitutional. The law's constitutionality is widely expected to ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. Vinson stopped short of granting an injunction, as the plaintiffs requested, to prevent the law from going forward while the case is appealed. He said such a step was unnecessary because of a "long-standing presumption" that the federal government adheres to rulings of this type. That part of Vinson's ruling triggered an immediate dispute about the practical effects of the opinion. David Rivkin, a conservative lawyer in Washington who represents the plaintiffs, said that the 26 states that are party to the lawsuit are no longer subject to any of the law's requirements - unless the federal government obtains a stay of Vinson's order from an appeals court. White House officials firmly rejected that view. "Implementation will proceed apace," one senior White House official said in a background briefing for reporters. If the plaintiffs prove right, the provisions that could be thrown in doubt at least temporarily include some that are already in effect, such as one prohibiting states from saving money by tightening their eligibility standards for Medicaid. The law's requirement that individuals purchase health insurance - the issue at the center of the lawsuit - will not take effect until 2014; nor will other important elements of the law, including the requirement that states set up "exchanges," or marketplaces, through which individuals and small businesses will be able purchase private insurance with federal subsidies. "All of that is dead with regard to these 26 states," Rivkin said. White House aides declined to discuss the opinion for attribution. But two senior officials, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity, disparaged the judge's ruling, repeatedly calling it an "outlier." One of the officials said, "The analysis on the whole is, to put it charitably, very unconventional." Asked by several reporters whether the ruling could give states that oppose the law permission to stop work on putting it into practice, the officials were adamant that it would not. "He is one court," one of the officials said. "I don't think you should view this as the opening of the government shutting down implementation." The Justice Department immediately announced that it plans to appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. A Justice spokeswoman, Tracy Schmaler, also said in a statement, "We are analyzing this opinion to determine what steps, if any - including seeking a stay - are necessary while the appeal is pending" in order to continue implementing the law. David Engstrom, a Stanford Law School faculty member, said that he does not interpret the opinion as preventing the law from going forward. "The issue that the court has ruled on has been specifically contradicted by two other district courts," he said. "So, the idea that the Obama administration should somehow stand down from implementing the act, based on a fourth district court, doesn't have any basis in law." In his 78-page opinion, Vinson, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, offered the most lengthy consideration to date of the legal questions at issue. Specifically, he agreed with the states' argument that a person's refusal to buy health insurance does not amount to economic activity and is therefore beyond Congress's power to regulate under the Constitution's commerce clause. Attorneys for the government have argued that since virtually everyone will need health care at some point and that, because hospitals cannot turn away patients who cannot pay for emergency care, people who do not obtain insurance are effectively making an economic decision about how and when they will pay for that care. Instead of paying now through insurance premiums, they are choosing to pay later, either out of their own pocket, or by passing the cost on to hospitals, governments or paying patients. Because this decision, when taken in the aggregate, has enormous impact on the health-care and insurance markets, the government contends that Congress is entitled to regulate it. But Vinson held that this line of reasoning "is without logical limitations." "Every person throughout the course of his or her life makes hundreds or even thousands of decisions that involve the same general thought process that the defendants maintain is 'economic activity,' " he wrote. Vinson also rejected the government's argument that Congress also was justified in imposing the insurance mandate under the clause empowering Congress to make all laws "necessary and proper" to carrying out its enumerated constitutional powers. The government maintains that, without the insurance mandate, many of the law's regulations on insurers would not be feasible - most notably its prohibition against insurers denying insurance or charging higher rates to those with preexisting conditions. If individuals could wait until they were on their way to a hospital before buying insurance, and insurers were forced to accept them, the companies would go bankrupt or be forced to raise their rates to unsustainable levels. Once again, Vinson found no logical limit to the government's argument. "Rather than being used to implement or facilitate enforcement of the Act's insurance industry reforms, the individual mandate is actually being used as the means to avoid the adverse consequences of the Act itself," Vinson wrote.

Monday's sweeping ruling came in the most closely watched of the two dozen separate challenges to the law. Florida along with 25 states had filed a lawsuit last spring, seeking to dismiss a law critics had labeled "Obamacare." U.S. District Judge Robert Vinson declared unconstitutional the key provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- the so-called "individual mandate" requiring most Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 or face penalties. Vinson also declared unconstitutional the section of the act that withholds Medicare funds from states that refuse to participate. But unlike another federal judge who ruled the individual mandate unconstitutional last month, Vinson ruled that the unconstitutionality voided the entire act. "I must reluctantly conclude that Congress exceeded the bounds of its authority in passing the Act with the individual mandate. That is not to say, of course, that Congress is without power to address the problems and inequities in our health care system," wrote Vinson. Health care headed to Supreme Court Gov. 'happy' about health care ruling RELATED TOPICS Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Barack Obama Florida "Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable, the entire Act must be declared void. This has been a difficult decision to reach, and I am aware that it will have indeterminable implications," Vinson wrote, adding, "At a time when there is virtually unanimous agreement that health care reform is needed in this country, it is hard to invalidate and strike down a statute titled "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act." The Justice Department declared its intentions to appeal the ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. "We strongly disagree with the court's ruling today and continue to believe -- as other federal courts have found -- that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional," said department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. "This is one of a number of cases pending before courts around the country, including several that the government has won in the district courts that are now before the courts of appeals. There is clear and well-established legal precedent that Congress acted within its constitutional authority in passing this law and we are confident that we will ultimately prevail on appeal." Schmaler added that the department is determining what other steps to take "including seeking a stay ... while the appeal is pending to continue our progress toward ensuring that Americans do not lose out on the important protections this law provides, that the millions of children and adults who depend on Medicaid programs receive the care the law requires, and that the millions of seniors on Medicare receive the benefits they need." Sen. Marco Rubio, the Republican freshman senator from Florida, praised the ruling and called on the Senate to take up the recently approved House bill repealing the act. "ObamaCare was a mistake," he said. "However, we cannot leave this decision in the hands of judges alone. The Senate Democrat leadership should follow the House's lead and hold an up-or-down vote to repeal ObamaCare. The optimal outcome for Florida and the American people is to repeal the federal health care law and replace it with common-sense reforms that will lower health care costs and get more Americans insured." House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, agreed that the Senate should take up the repeal bill, saying it was "the easiest way to protect the American people." "Today's decision affirms the view, held by most of the states and a majority of the American people, that the federal government should not be in the business of forcing you to buy health insurance and punishing you if you don't," he said. "It's not only unconstitutional, it's also unaffordable. This health care law remains a major source of uncertainty for small businesses, which is why all parties involved should request that this case be sent to the U.S. Supreme Court for a swift and fair resolution." Newly elected Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus joined the call for the Senate to vote on repeal -- after Senate Republicans noted earlier in the day that all of them would vote in favor. "The new Republican House majority has already fulfilled its promise to the American people and voted to repeal this unaffordable, unconstitutional legislation and it is time for the Senate to follow suit," he said. "Senate Democrats cannot continue to defend the indefensible and keep a law on the books that is not only opposed by the American people but also raises clear constitutional concerns." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, however, disagreed that Americans want the act repealed. "This lawsuit is nothing more than an attempt by those who want to raise taxes on small businesses, increase prescription prices for seniors and allow insurance companies to once again deny sick children medical care," he said. "Health care reform is the law of the land and, now that Americans see its benefits, a majority of them oppose Republicans' dangerous plans to repeal a law that put patients in control of their own health care. Rather than focusing obsessively on the past and pushing a plan that will add $1 trillion to the deficit, Republicans should join Democrats in working to create jobs and strengthen the middle class." And Rep. Pete Stark, D-California, and ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, pointed out that Vinson's 78-page ruling went against several other district court rulings. "Republicans have no problems with activist judges as long as they're taking rights away from the American people," he said. "Several other judges across the country have ruled that health reform is clearly constitutional, a viewpoint that will win the day at the end of all this partisan posturing." The states bringing suit in this appeal are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Virginia and Oklahoma have filed separate challenges, along with other groups and individuals opposed to the law. A federal judge in eastern Virginia has also found the health care law unconstitutional, while two other federal judges, one in western Virginia and one in Michigan, have ruled just the opposite. Additionally, according to the White House, 12 other federal judges have dismissed challenges to the law. The two judges who ruled against the law were appointed by Republican presidents; the two who ruled in favor of the law were appointed by Democratic presidents. Such disagreements almost ensure the high court will take up the issue. The various cases will likely have to go separate federal appeals courts before the justices would take up one or more of the cases. There was no indication when the Supreme Court would take the case, although it could be as soon as later this year. In the Florida case, opponents were targeting not only that individual mandate, but also the law's requirement that each state expand Medicaid to cover more of the low-income uninsured. "It's an enormous burden on the states that they never agreed to," then-Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum said last month after oral arguments. The Medicaid expansion, he said, amounts to "the compulsion and coercion of the states, in violation of the 10th Amendment." Under the law, the federal government is supposed to pay states for most of the cost of the Medicaid expansion -- an estimated 95 percent over the first five years, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott estimated the expansion could cost his state up to $25 billion over 10 years. In his ruling Vinson seemed almost apologetic that he had to rule against the government on an issue he repeatedly referred to as monumental. But he said forcing Americans to buy a product like health care insurance that they may not want or need clearly violates the Constitution. "I will simply observe, once again, that my conclusion in this case is based on an application of the Commerce Clause law as it exists pursuant to the Supreme Court's current interpretation and definition," he wrote. "Only the Supreme Court (or a Constitutional amendment) can expand that." President Barack Obama has said the requirement is justified for the overall good. "All we've said is, everybody has to get some basic insurance, so that we're not paying for you when you get sick," he said in an interview last month. "It's the right thing to do, and I'm confident that the courts will uphold it." The mandate on individuals to buy insurance is not scheduled to go into effect until 2014. But if that portion of the law is ultimately struck down, analysts say it would make it difficult to pay for the law's other, more popular provisions. In the meantime, the public will already benefit from several other provisions of the law, according to White House health care policy director Nancy-Ann DeParle. Those include requirements that insurers offer coverage to children of beneficiaries until age 26, not deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and not place a lifetime cap on benefits. The case is Florida v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (3:10-cv-91-RV/EMT).

The ruling is the most sweeping blow yet to President Obama's signature domestic achievement. February 01, 2011 | By Noam N. Levey and David G. Savage, Washington Bureau President Obama's administration said it would appeal the healthcare… (Larry Downing, Reuters ) Reporting from Washington — A federal judge in Florida dealt President Obama's healthcare overhaul a sweeping blow Monday, ruling the law unconstitutional because of its requirement that Americans have health insurance starting in 2014. U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson declined to suspend the law but said the government should abide by his ruling, potentially complicating implementation in some states. DOCUMENTS: Read Judge Vinson's decision The Washington lawyer who represented the 26 states in the lawsuit said the ruling freed them from complying with its provisions, including requirements not to cut people from their Medicaid programs, as some governors say they want to do. "For the 26 states that were parties to this suit, the entire statute is dead," said David B. Rivkin Jr. "The decision has immediate force, and it means all the new Medicaid stuff is gone." Obama administration officials disputed Rivkin's analysis and indicated they would appeal Vinson's decision. "We don't believe this kind of judicial activism will be upheld and we are confident that the Affordable Care Act will ultimately be declared constitutional," Assistant to the President Stephanie Cutter said in a White House blog post. With lower federal courts divided, the fate of Obama's signature domestic achievement will probably be decided by the Supreme Court, which could rule as soon as next year. In separate lawsuits, two other federal courts have ruled that the law's insurance mandate is permissible under the so-called Commerce Clause of the Constitution. A third federal judge in Virginia ruled in December that the mandate was unconstitutional, but stopped short of invalidating the whole law. Parts of the law have already taken effect, including drug discounts for seniors, tax credits for small businesses and insurance regulations that prevent insurers from denying coverage to sick children. In Arizona, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, who is pressing the Obama administration for permission to cut people from its Medicaid rolls to save money, said the state would not abandon that effort. "We are not going to act unilaterally," spokesman Matthew Benson said. Arizona is among the states that joined Florida in its lawsuit. Vinson's rejection of the mandate as an overextension of government power appears certain to further energize Republican efforts to dismantle the law. In often colorful language that invoked the Boston Tea Party, Vinson, an appointee of President Reagan, rejected the administration's argument that Congress' broad powers to regulate commerce allowed lawmakers to require Americans to buy health insurance. "The existing problems in our national healthcare system are recognized," Vinson wrote in his 78-page decision. "There is widespread sentiment for positive improvements that will reduce costs, improve the quality of care, and expand availability in a way that the nation can afford. Regardless of how laudable its attempts may have been to accomplish these goals in passing the act, Congress must operate within the bounds established by the Constitution." Vinson warned that if Congress could require health insurance, it could also decide for Americans "whether and when (or not) to buy a house, a car, a television, a dinner or even a morning cup of coffee." "It is difficult to imagine," Vinson said, "that a nation which began, at least in part, as the result of opposition to a British mandate giving the East India Company a monopoly and imposing a nominal tax on all tea sold in America would have set out to create a government with the power to force people to buy tea in the first place." The insurance mandate in the healthcare law was designed to spread risk more broadly and control insurance premiums, enabling the federal government to offer consumers other protections — such as prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to those with preexisting medical conditions. Without a mandate, healthy Americans can avoid buying insurance until they get sick. Those who do buy insurance tend to be sicker than the general population. That phenomenon, which has occurred in several states that have guaranteed the right to coverage without any insurance requirement, has helped drive up premiums. "People who make an economic decision to forgo health insurance do not opt out of the healthcare market," said Cutter of the White House. "As Congress found, every year millions of people without insurance obtain healthcare they cannot pay for, shifting tens of billions of dollars in added cost onto those who have insurance and onto taxpayers." But the mandate remains the most unpopular feature of the healthcare overhaul and has helped galvanize a nationwide Republican attack on the law. Nineteen states joined Florida in the suit last year: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington. In January, six more states joined the suit after new GOP governors took office: Ohio, Kansas, Wyoming, Wisconsin, Maine and Iowa. Except for Louisiana, which is represented in the suit by its Democratic attorney general, the states are represented by Republican governors or attorneys general. Several dozen leading consumer groups, medical associations and patient advocates joined the Obama administration in defending the law. They include the American Medical Assn., the American Hospital Assn., the Consumers Union and the March of Dimes Foundation. noam.levey@latimes.com david.savage@latimes.com FEATURED Death of Scott Sterling, son of Clippers owner, ruled accidental The frequent fliers who flew too much How not to say the wrong thing MORE: Mayor feels a `sense of failure' in marital split Seizure Led to FloJo's Death His 104 scores make his case Brutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons' Shock Advertisement &lt;a href=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=339767&amp;cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=339767&amp;cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; FROM THE ARCHIVES Federal court backs healthcare law November 10, 2011 In a surprise, D.C. appeals court upholds healthcare law November 8, 2011 Ruling won't stand in way of healthcare reform...
