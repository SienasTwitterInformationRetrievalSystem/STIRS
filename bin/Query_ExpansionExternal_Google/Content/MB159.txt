Foundation launches global business alliance: the Circular Economy 100 6th February 2013 By: Editorial team Tweet 100 companies to create $10b economic value over three year period through commitment to circular economy initiatives The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has today launched the Circular Economy 100, a three year programme aimed at bringing together a network of 100 leading companies globally to facilitate development and commitment to new circular economy projects. The CE100 will provide executive education on key themes and emerging trends, share knowledge and new learnings, and identify and develop solutions to common challenges. The objective is that by 2015 participating companies will have triggered circular initiatives that will result in an aggregated economic benefit of $10b for the businesses involved. The circular economy represents a clear and proven opportunity for businesses around the world. Our new initiative brings cohesion and focus to this opportunity and allows businesses to share experiences, learn from best practice and to work together to achieve real business benefits. Each of the members of the CE100 has made a commitment to a circular economy initiative. In total we anticipate that this has a value of more than $10 billion, encouraging innovation, investment and job creation. Dame Ellen MacArthur, initiator of the Foundation The launch comes as a result of the exceptional response from business to the publication of two reports by the Foundation, launched during the World Economic Forum in Davos, with analysis by McKinsey, which demonstrate over $1trillion of opportunities posed by circular economy innovation. The creation of the new alliance is supported by the Foundation’s founding partners, Cisco, BT, National Grid, B&Q and Renault. Twenty companies have already confirmed their membership of the programme, which officially opens today, including Coca-Cola, M&S, IKEA Group, Morrisons, Tarkett, FLOOW2, Heights, iFixit, Ricoh, Vestas, WRAP, Turntoo, and Desso. The programme will seek its remaining membership from industry sectors believed to be fundamental to the evolution of the circular economy. In addition to working with some of the world’s biggest businesses the programme will include a parallel group of ‘emerging innovators’ in the form of new tech businesses believed to hold the key to unlocking innovation barriers to circular progress. The CE100 is based on the principle that a global alliance across the business community can realise greater value, and faster, than companies operating individually and in isolation. Membership of the CE100 allows companies to benefit from: privileged access to a library of best practice guidance and application tools access to an online executive education programme access to a series of acceleration workshops aimed at stimulating circular economy innovation an annual summit which will expose members to latest thinking, offer an opportunity to showcase success stories and network with other CE100 members We’re very proud to be involved in the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE100 Programme. Plan A is driving M&S to deliver restorative, circular systems for our products and services because we believe it’s crucial for the future of our company as the world faces up to the challenge of resource scarcity. We already have circular models in place like our clothes recycling initiative Shwopping but it is very early days and joining the CE100 Programme will help us learn more and share our experience with others. Richard Gillies, Director of Plan A at Marks & Spencer Our linear economy has failed us. We’re facing a future of resource scarcity, and it’s critical that we take steps now to prepare for a new economic reality. I anticipate tremendous growth opportunities for businesses involved in repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing. We are looking forward to partnering with companies in the Circular Economy 100 to develop new, repair-driven business models.

These new realities have galvanized an international community of academia, NGOs, governments and corporate interests to promote new principles to guide future economic decision-making. Circular economic thinking is one key outcome of these exchanges and applies the principles of industrial ecology to economic development to foster the conditions necessary to make economic activities more resource efficient and environmentally benign. A primary goal of the circular economy is waste prevention; a successful transition would virtually eliminate material leakage and disposal by treating waste as a feedstock for new processes. Policies that require producers to be directly involved in the recovery of products at their end-of-life are therefore inextricably linked to the goals of the circular economy. Producers of an increasingly wide range of consumer products are now obligated in more than 50 countries to design, implement and fund the end-of-life management of the products that they supply into the market — a policy approach known broadly as product stewardship and in some countries as extended producer responsibility. However, many of today’s models for resource recovery, reuse and recycling fall short of maximizing innovation and social benefits due to poor program design and the fact that product stewardship programs are generally managed at a sub-national level; this results in reduced economic efficiency through significant revenue loss as large volumes of high-value materials cannot be leveraged in a patchwork system. Major multinational companies are now required to participate in hundreds of individually regulated recycling programs around the globe, each with differing rules and responsibilities. Innovation is stymied and resources wasted due to a lack of scale and poorly conceived public policies. The design and implementation of industry-led product stewardship programs, therefore, has major implications for our collective ability to jumpstart the transition to a circular economy. Large multinationals require stable, large-volume supplies of high-value material to meet the demands of a growing global marketplace. With resource reserves dwindling, this is becoming increasingly difficult and more expensive to achieve. For packaging specifically, the transition to a circular economy is difficult because producers face supply challenges in the form of inconsistent quality and volume and have to compete against global commodity markets for feedstock. Coca-Cola, for example, has established a growing number of bottle-to-bottle facilities and is in need of significant supplies of collected PET to create new bottles for their beverages. With sales anticipated to increase in the future, Coca-Cola’s sustainability commitments are dependent on the dramatic expansion of plastics collection in all markets in order to secure a sufficient supply of quality materials. The current inability of many product stewardship programs to deliver in this regard comes down essentially to financing and scale. Financing models such as product taxes and shared financial responsibility focus primarily on extending the lifespan of existing landfills and reducing financial demands on the limited property tax base. These approaches are worthwhile but have proven insufficient in achieving the far-reaching changes needed to transition to a circular economy. A more direct feedback mechanism is needed that incents major brands to break the “cradle-to-gate" mindset that guides the vast majority of business decisions. Financing models that allocate the full costs of end-of-life management to producers can contribute to this end; however, a shift in mindset commensurate with the scale of the challenge itself is required and this will need to be led from the inside out. Internalizing the costs of end-of-life management within the price of the product will empower designers, managers, engineers and executives to bring products to market that have been designed for disassembly, collection, recycling and ultimately reintegration into the supply chain. Finding value at end-of-life simply becomes another component of this financial equation. A holistic approach that entails the thoughtful design and harmonization of stewardship programs coupled with a radical shift in internal corporate decision-making will produce the scale of change needed to feed the supply chains of the future. To maintain a social license to operate within the emerging circular economy, corporate leaders will also need to ask themselves: Is my supply chain something I can be proud of? The transition to a sustainable circular material flow cannot be achieved without the integration of the millions of workers (perhaps as much as 2% of the world’s population makes its living scavenging recyclable wastes) who collect, sort and process consumer waste — a sector that in many emerging markets is informal and does not enjoy any of the benefits and protection afforded to the workers in the “formal” material supply chain. In Brazil, Johnson & Johnson has launched Project Phoenix to address this issue directly by creating the business conditions necessary to transform the recycling supply chain and build a supplier base that upholds high standards for feedstock and labour conditions. To operate sustainably, multinationals will not only need to secure stable supplies of high-volume, high-quality feedstock but will also need to do so in a manner that provides acceptable working conditions for all. A circular economy is restorative and that applies to both people and planet. The impending resource crunch is a problem of such magnitude that micro-level, uncoordinated efforts will simply not suffice. The leading 100 multinational companies, however, can have a bold impact on circular material flows. Not only do the world’s largest companies control a large share of materials (according to the WWF, 100 companies control 25% of trade of “commodities of concern”), their operations and decision-making is not restricted by political boundaries. Further, their supply chains often overlap — a future disruption for one company is a disruption for many. With some primary resources rapidly depleting, these disruptions will become increasingly common if the status quo continues. Working together, therefore, is not at odds with competition but rather is a necessary precondition for it. By joining forces, market leaders can ensure conditions exist that require all producers to take responsibility for their products throughout the entire lifecycle on a level playing field. They can leverage their collective experience and share investment costs to accelerate the transition. Perhaps most importantly, when the world’s largest companies begin to change their mindset — when their decisions internalize the costs traditionally borne by society and the environment — other players will follow suit. The outcome will be a competitive landscape that provides more for customers while costing less for society and for the environment on which we all depend. [1] McKinsey Global Institute.

WRAP at heart of new circular economy initiative 6th February 2013 • WRAP  joins Ellen MacArthur CE100 Circular Economy programme (CE100) • New WRAP report on new business models for clothing sector shows potential of circular economy WRAP is to be a “pioneer member” of the Circular Economy 100 (CE100) programme, the global alliance announced today by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to accelerate progress towards a circular economy. Dr Liz Goodwin, CEO of WRAP, said: “I am delighted WRAP will be at the heart of this business-critical initiative. We will bring a combination of technical expertise combined with proven experience as a catalyst for change, to this important new learning collaboration.” WRAP has, and continues to play, a significant role in the circular economy through its work in areas such as food waste prevention, resource efficiency in products, plastic packaging and textiles. WRAP’s work on resource efficiency and waste prevention make it ideally placed to make a key contribution to the group’s work. To showcase the business potential of the circular economy, WRAP today launched a video for businesses outlining the four stages of a circular economy: design, make and sell, re-use and recycling products. WRAP sector specialist Gerrard Fisher explains the practical steps businesses can take, and outlines WRAP’s role in helping businesses achieve the move to a circular economy. To coincide with the launch of the CE100, WRAP unveiled a new report today that highlights innovative new business models for the clothing sector which could help deliver the circular economy. WRAP’s report - Evaluating the financial viability and resource implications for new business models in the clothing sector - looks at the commercial viability of a number of alternatives to traditional make-buy-use-dispose business models. It takes into account realistic estimates of the required investment, operating costs and sales value. One option was found to offer great commercial benefits including payback in just over two years. The models show how the life of clothes can be extended, helping to prevent them being prematurely discarded. The options range from large scale hiring of designer clothes to retailers offering re-sale of pre-owned garments.  Each model was assessed on the opportunity to build turnover as well as deliver a commercially attractive margin and return on investment.  Dr Liz Goodwin added: “To stay ahead in today’s competitive markets, companies need to reconsider the way they do business. The traditional consumption model of buy-use-dispose is rightly being challenged. You can see why when you consider the significant commercial value that can be realised from used clothes, as well as the water and material resources used in their production.” Notes to editors: • For information on the Circular Economy 100 visit www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/business/ce100 • For more information on Evaluating the financial viability and resource implications for new business models in the clothing sector, visit http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/innovative-business-models-clothing • Doing Good Business – The commercial benefits of a circular economy, http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/how-wrap-supports-circular-economy • As well as outlining practical examples to drive the circular economy, WRAP recently published its vision for the UK circular economy to 2020.

As part of the programme, companies will identify ways in which to promote a circular economy and result in ‘an aggregated economic benefit of $10 billion (£6.4 billion) by 2015'. Twenty companies have already confirmed their membership of the programme, which officially opens today, including WRAP, Coca-Cola, M&S, IKEA Group and Morrisons. The programme will seek its remaining membership from industry sectors in the hopes of creating a conglomerate of bodies which ‘will provide the opportunity for companies to stimulate circular economy innovation, foster collaboration, build capacity and unlock the economic opportunity through accelerator workshops, distance learning modules and an annual summit’. According to CE100, membership includes:  access to a library of best practice guidance and application tools; access to an online executive education programme; access to a series of acceleration workshops aimed at stimulating circular economy innovation; an annual summit which will expose members to latest thinking, offer an opportunity to showcase success stories and network with other CE100 members. Speaking of the launch of CE100, Dame Ellen MacArthur said: “The circular economy represents a clear and proven opportunity for businesses around the world.

The video for businesses outlines the four stages of a circular economy: how we design, make and sell, reuse and recycle products. ‘Doing Good Business: The commercial benefits of a circular economy’ sees WRAP sector specialist Gerrard Fisher explain the practical steps businesses can take, as well as the services WRAP offers to help interested companies. And the ‘Evaluating the financial viability and resource implications for new business models in the clothing sector’ report looks at the commercial viability of five alternatives to traditional make-buy-use-dispose business models. WRAP claims the report ‘takes into account realistic estimates of the required investment, operating costs and sales value’ for each alternative model. The models show how the life of clothes can be extended, helping to prevent them being prematurely discarded. The options examined are: repair and upgrading services; large-scale leasing of baby clothes; large-scale hiring of designer clothes; resale of pre-owned garments; and an online platform for peer-to-peer clothing exchange. Each model was assessed on the opportunity to build turnover as well as deliver a commercially attractive margin and return on investment.  Goodwin added: “To stay ahead in today’s competitive markets, companies need to reconsider the way they do business. The traditional consumption model of buy-use-dispose is rightly being challenged. You can see why when you consider the significant commercial value that can be realised from used clothes, as well as the water and material resources used in their production.” Read more information about Circular Economy 100 and WRAP’s work on the circular economy.

For latest news click here> For advice and guidance click here > Home | News & Updates ‘Circular economy’ alliance aims to trigger £6.4bn of economic benefit to business Resource efficiency news - by GreenWise Staff 6th February 2013 An alliance of leading businesses, led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, has today launched an initiative with the aim of creating £6.4 billion ($10 billion) of economic benefit through the reuse and repurposing of industrial waste. Circular Economy 100 (CE100) is looking to bring together a network of 100 companies globally over the next three years that are seeking to move to a more sustainable business model through 'circular’ projects. Over a dozen leading businesses have already signed up to the project, including M&S, Coca-Cola, IKEA and Cisco. Most current economic models take resources to make a product and then dispose of the industrial waste. But in a circular economy, the components of production stay in the economic system rather than becoming waste products. Examples of the circular economy include the 'closed loop' system now used for turning old plastic bottles into new ones. A recent report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, highlighted a £402 billion opportunity for companies transitioning into a circular economy, while analysis by McKinsey demonstrates circular economy innovation could trigger over £64 billion of opportunities. "The circular economy represents a clear and proven opportunity for businesses around the world," Dame Ellen MacArthur, the former record-breaking round the world yachtswoman and founder of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, said. "Our new initiative brings cohesion and focus to this opportunity and allows businesses to share experiences, learn from best practice and to work together to achieve real business benefits. Each of the members of the CE100 has made a commitment to a circular economy initiative. In total we anticipate that this have a value of more than $10 billion, encouraging innovation, investment and job creation." Collaborative approach The CE100 will provide membership companies with best practice guidance and application tools, online training, workshops and forum to share knowledge and new learnings, and identify and develop solutions to common challenges. It will also help technology start-ups with promising innovations to break down the barriers to circular progress. Research by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs shows UK businesses consume 600 million tonnes of materials a year. Around one-third of this ends up as waste, even much of it could be used productively with benefits of up to £18 billion. Changing consumption models The Government’s waste advisory body, WRAP, is one of the founding members of the CE100 and will lend its technical expertise to the initiative. WRAP chief executive Liz Goodwin, said businesses need to realise the full value of materials through resource management in order to remain competitive. "To stay ahead in today’s competitive markets, companies need to reconsider the way they do business. The traditional consumption model of buy-use-dispose is rightly being challenged." Commenting on the new programme, Richard Gillies, director of Plan A at Marks & Spencer, said: "Plan A is driving M&S to deliver restorative, circular systems for our products and services because we believe it’s crucial for the future of our company as the world faces up to the challenge of resource scarcity. We already have circular models in place like our clothes recycling initiative Shwopping but it is very early days and joining the CE100 Programme will help us learn more and share our experience with others." There are currently 18 companies who have confirmed participation in the initiative including: The Coca-Cola Company, Desso, FLOOW2, Heights, iFixit, Ikea Groups, M&S, Morrisons, Ricoh, Vestas, WRAP, Turntoo, Renault, National Grid, B&Q, Cisco, BT, Tarkett. Ellen MacArthur launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation just over two years ago to "re-think" the entire way we run our economies. Like this story?

Ricoh has a long history of adopting a greener ethos and instills this across its entire business from manufacturing, distribution and workforce and partner initiatives to ensure a sustainable attitude and place a greater importance on lowering its environmental impact. In January 2013 Ricoh was announced as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations  for the ninth year in a row and is committed to reducing its CO2 emissions by 87.5 per cent by 2050, compared to 2000 levels.  Through its 'Total Green Office Solutions' , a range of products and services for large and small businesses, Ricoh ensures it delivers efficient, cost effective document management services which lead to better knowledge sharing, customer responsiveness and business agility. Phil Keoghan, CEO at Ricoh UK, was always keen to work with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation: “We are delighted to be one of the pioneer members of the Circular Economy 100.  As an organisation, we have been committed to reducing our environmental impact since 1976 and together with the other CE100 members we are optimistic that the power of our collective imagination can inspire a generation to think differently, and create a sustainable legacy for many years to come.” As part of its mission to accelerate the transition to the circular economy, The Ellen MacArthur Foundation commissioned a series of reports highlighting the economic rationale for the transition to a circular economy and outlined an opportunity in excess of $2 trillion for the global economy. Last month in Davos, the Foundation launched a new report showcasing that the consumer goods industry could save $700bn a year if they start taking action, such as introducing the anaerobic digestion of household waste. Dame Ellen MacArthur established the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 2010 and works with business and education organisations to accelerate the transition of a regenerative circular economy. Along with Ricoh, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation believes that business innovation sits at the heart of any transition to the circular economy and can enable the analysis and communication of its broad economic potential for businesses to re-think current working practices as well as future ones.
