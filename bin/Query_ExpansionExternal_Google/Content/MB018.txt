A Buckingham Palace courtier told the British newspaper, "Faxes have been used before for large-scale events. They are an efficient and polite way to inform people as quickly as possible." But it's not totally the dark ages over in London. Of note: the Royal Engagement was announced on Twitter and the Queen has both Facebook and Flickr pages. Gold-embossed and handwritten invitations will be sent out to the 1,800 guests next month, according to the Mail, but thanks to the fax, some attendees are already confirmed for the nuptials of the year -- like Greece's King Constantine, his wife Queen Anne-Marie and their eldest son Crown Prince Pavlov, Serbia's Crown Prince Alexander and his wife Crown Princess Katherine and members of the Romanian monarchy.

Yvonne Yorke: Royal Wedding Facts vs. Fiction & More Dress Designer Hints I've just returned last week from one of my regular trips to London, and I was astonished to hear some of the media stories that have been circulating -- many of which a Buckingham Palace spokesperson I spoke to declare to be "entertaining but untrue." In fact, there's so much misinformation out there that it's become a joke within royal circles.

The preliminary invites came as faxes from Buckingham Palace, with a spokeswoman for King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece confirming to People: 'I cannot give you any further details other than that but they have received a sort of save the date fax.' A royal source added that the Palace has put out 'heads-ups' to key families and guests in Britain, to ensure the 29th April is kept free for William and Kate's nuptials. The guest list is yet to be confirmed, with the couple reportedly still finalising the details. As she gears up for the big day, it has been revealed this week that Kate has quit the family business, ready to prepare for her new life.

Mario Testino/Clarence House Press Office via Getty Images Shares Tweets Stumble Email More + Prince William and Kate Middleton pose in the Cornwall Room in St James's Palace in London on Nov. 25, 2010, in one of their two official engagement portraits. Mario Testino/Clarence House/Getty NEW YORK (CBS) Prince William and Kate Middleton have started sending out save-the-dates for their upcoming wedding - but don't expect to get one if you're not a member of a royal family, or if you don't own a fax machine. Europe's major royal families have received faxes from Buckingham Palace asking them to keep April 29 open for the British prince's wedding. PICTURES: Prince William and Kate Middleton SPECIAL SECTION: The Royal Wedding Britain's Daily Mail reports that while more traditional invitations will be sent to 1,800 guests by the Lord Chamberlain's Office next month, protocol dictates that sovereigns are given earlier warning than foreign heads of state and non-VIP guests. Courtiers told the paper that the faxes were the most "efficient" way of informing people and have been used before for "large-scale" events. King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece received one of those save-the-dates, and will attend the event with their eldest son Crown Prince Pavlov. A spokesman told the Mail: "They received a fax in the last few days." Prince Alexander and Princess Katherine of Serbia will also be there. They released a statement on their website as their RSVP, writing that they will be "delighted to attend." Other royal houses, including Spain, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Belgium, are expected to be invited. Royal spokesmen told the paper that the guest list was still being finalized. © 2011 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Prince William and his fiancee Kate Middleton  Photo: AP By Andy Bloxham 8:05AM GMT 26 Jan 2011 Follow The save-the-date warnings were sent to the major sovereigns in Europe because protocol dictates that they are given earlier notice than foreign heads of state and non-VIP guests. However, the full handwritten invitations to the royal wedding, embossed in gold, will be sent to all 1,800 guests by the Lord Chamberlain's Office next month. Courtiers told the Daily Mail that this was the most “efficient” way of passing on information about “large-scale” events. Some of the guests have already confirmed they will be at Westminster Abbey on April 29. King Constantine, Greece’s former monarch, his wife Queen Anne-Marie, 64, and their eldest son Crown Prince Pavlov, 43, are to attend.

View Profile William & Kate to wed April 29 Share Tweet Pin Share Stumble Tumble Saved In this day and age, it was not surprising that Prince William and Kate Middleton announced their engagement via the Internet. The Queen of England faxing out save-the-dates for April 29 seems a little strange, but Evite does seem a bit lowbrow for the royals. Queen Elizabeth joined the modern age last year with Facebook and Flickr pages and Twitter's @BritishMonarchy has over 99,000 followers; but the royal wedding save-the-date shout-out was only for the elite. If you didn't get your fax, you may still be in the running. With the guest list still being paired down, 1,800 handwritten, gold-embossed invites will go out to the rest of the wedding riffraff later, but with a big event like the crown prince's wedding, it's important to get the date out to the rest of the royal court early. "The Lord Chamberlain's office does give a heads-up to royal families first, in line with protocol," a St. James's Palace aide told the Daily Mail. To that end, Buckingham Palace sent out faxes to Europe's highest ranking royals, asking them to keep April 29 free for Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding. "Faxes have been used before for large-scale events," a Buckingham Palace courtier told the Daily Mail. "They are an efficient and polite way to inform people as quickly as possible." The story goes on to reveal that RSVPs for the Westminster Abbey wedding ceremony of Prince William and Kate Middleton have already come in from Greece's King Constantine, his wife Queen Anne-Marie and their eldest son Crown Prince Pavlov; Serbia's Crown Prince Alexander and his wife Crown Princess Katherine, and members of the Romanian monarchy. Stay tuned for word from the royals of Spain, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Belgium. This new round of wedding news, just a day after the announcement that Middleton quit her job, makes it appear that Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding plans will stay in the news until they tie the knot on April 29. Then it will be time for honeymoon sneak peeks and baby watch!

Incoming Fax From Prince William & His Future Princess: Save-The-Date! 1/26/2011 12:20 PM ET | Filed under: Royals Royce • Silly! Really? Faxes? We imagine the royal family could’ve sprung for something a bit grander than that! According to sources, the royal families of Europe have all received their save-the-date notices for Prince William and Kate Middleton’s upcoming April nuptials – via fax! A spokeswoman for King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece confirmed the strange news, revealing that her majesties received their “sort of save the date fax” earlier this week. Times they are a-changin’! Maybe they’re trying to start a new trend! Maybe their wedding invitations will be Evites! Ha!

See All 9 Comments 9 comments to “Incoming Fax From Prince William & His Future Princess: Save-The-Date!” Paulie says – reply to this 1 This is news? This is stupid. Its a save the date…who cares if they faxed it. Its not like its the actual invite. DSummerfan says – reply to this 2 Are those two still fornicating ? Kimberbunny says – reply to this 3 Who still faxes anything? Gata Negra says – reply to this 4 Greece does not have a king since 1973, you idiotic asshole. lemonbird says – reply to this 5 They're modern, Perez. It's the 21st century. It's what people do. A lot of people use e-vites instead of invites thru snail mail, too. But this is a formal occasion and I bet the invitation itself will be a collector's item. Sending a fax is less expensive then snail mail. Plus it lets all the people know they are going to be invited in case they were wondering. In a way it is a kindness. Because if you are famous and you didn't get a "save the dat" fax, you know you aren't on the guest list so you can make plans to be in Dafur helping orphans since it will be embarrassing if you sit home and people know you weren't invited. Gilbert Bumpucker says – reply to this 6 They sent me an email since Bill noticed I didn't have a fax machine. I've never met Kate, only chatted through IM. Good Karma says – reply to this 7 She looks like she could be his mother in that photo. Marrying his mother per chance? Good Karma says – reply to this 8 Re: Kimberbunny – Listen techno wizard…it is possible to fax to a computer and bypass the scan email steps. ohmeow says – reply to this 9 I got a "Save the date" magnet from my niece….
