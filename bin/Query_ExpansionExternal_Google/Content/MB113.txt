Douglas Ernst Bareknuckled Commentary mixed with Pop Culture. Main menu Skip to content Home About Douglas Ernst Search for: February 20, 2013 Kal Penn confirms: ‘Harold and Kumar Get Droned’ in production 14 Satire • Tags: Drones, entertainment, Harold and Kumar, Hollywood, Kal Penn, Movies, Obama Administration, Satire In 2008, Kal Penn “exposed” the Bush administration for its war crimes with in ‘Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.’ Although Penn was a staunch supporter of President Obama’s reelection campaign, he assures fans that targeting American civilians with drone strikes (a step beyond anything Bush ever did) has prompted him to begin production of ‘Harold and Kumar get Droned.’ Filming along the border between India and Pakistan starts in late spring or early summer. Fans of the Harold and Kumar movies can rejoice: Kal Penn announced shortly after NBC dropped news of the Obama administration “white papers” that “Harold and Kumar get Droned” is already underway. The Hollywood Reporter is preparing a piece to run in the coming weeks, which details how Kal Penn (who previously took a break from acting to become Associate Director in the White House Office of Public Engagement) was furious when the news broke of Justice Department memos spelling out the legal justification for assassinating American citizens. “In 2008, Jon Hurwitz wrote one hell of a script for ‘Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay,'” said Penn. “Warner Bros. and New Line put millions of dollars on the table so myself and John [Cho] could expose the Bush administration for what it was — a bunch of war criminals. It would be hypocritical of me to sit back on the sidelines as President Obama, a man I worked for, took the Bush Doctrine to a whole new level.” When pressed for details, Penn admitted that the plot will involve Harold and Kumar traveling to India, a location where a gold mine of religion, sex and drug-fueled comedy exists. While trekking along the border between Pakistan and India, the Obama administration will target Harold and Kumar for assassination, mistaking them both for American terrorists attempting to make their first connection with regional terror cells. Responding to fans on his Facebook page, Penn said that he does not regret making an ‘Obama for America’ video in the run up to the 2012 election or hosting the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, because details of the white paper were not known at the time. “Back then, I only new that President Obama was killing men and women from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen. The rest is all news to me. Now that I know the truth, I’m going to do my part to set this right. I will. I promise. And come hell or high water, Neil Patrick Harris will be along for the ride!” While no release date has been set for “Harold and Kumar Get Droned,” the director of ‘A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas,’Todd Strauss-Schulson, recently Tweeted: “Get the red carpet ready for Christmas 2013, Hollywood.” Producer Greg Shapiro replied “Let’s do this.” It looks like 2013 is going to be a great year for Harold and Kumar fans, even if it’s at the expense of President Obama. Update: Production on ‘Harold and Kumar Get Droned’ has been delayed due to rising tensions in the Middle East. Mr. Penn notes that the man he worked for, President Obama, escalated those tensions with his recent PR campaign to bomb Syria. A tentative deal has been reached on Syria’s chemical weapons with Russia, but Greg Shapiro has been tight-lipped on when, or if, production will resume.

Reply Douglas Ernst says: September 24, 2013 at 8:33 am Sir, the point of this piece — tagged and categorized as satire — is to put a spotlight on Kal Penn’s hypocrisy. If he was intellectually honest, he would take the Obama administration to task just as he took Bush to task. Many of the same things that inspired him to make the second Harold and Kumar movie are still happening — and some things, like the use of drones, Obama has taken to a whole new level. Next time Kal Penn (who worked for Obama) tells you what a swell guy he is, remember that Mr. Penn only gets livid about drones and NSA surveillance when his guy isn’t in office. Reply Jim Z says: September 24, 2013 at 9:17 am You’re joking, right? Did you read past the first paragraph? Douglas Ernst says: September 24, 2013 at 9:24 am Jim, This piece has been getting good traffic for months, and now people are Googling “Hard and Kumar Get Droned” to get to the site. It’s taken on a life of it’s own. I wish I could show you the WordPress stats. It’s tagged as satire and I even highlighted the central premise — that Penn is incredibly hypocritical. He got up on his moral pedestal when ‘W’ was president and complained, but the guy he worked and made cheesy pitches for during the 20112 election goes drone-crazy, bomb-Syria crazy and NSA-spying crazy … and silence. Dave says: September 24, 2013 at 10:15 am Doug Drones work for me. We wipe out a bunch of piece of crap terrorists without the loss of american life. Whats not to like? Normal Americans don’t really have a problem with NSA Spying. If your not doing anything wrong it won’t be an issue. They would get bored pretty quickly listening to the conversations coming from me. Reply Douglas Ernst says: September 24, 2013 at 10:27 am Dave, you’ll notice that this piece is about Kal Penn’s hypocrisy — not my stance on national defense issues. My personal preferences on national security matters, particularly when it comes to dealing with terrorism, are much more nuanced. Regardless, I find it rather frightening how you have no qualms with the federal government spying on the phone conversations of millions of innocent Americans. You seem to have not thought about the repercussions beyond your own life. Reply Jay says: September 24, 2013 at 10:43 am The problem people have with the drones is that they do NOT always hit only terrorists. Many women, children, and non-militant men above the age of 13 (it seems that any male over the age of 13 who is killed by a drone is automatically classified as a combatant, whether that is true or not) have been killed by drones, at their homes, and even in funerals and weddings. Even a few Americans have been targeted, including a 16 year old boy. Two kids playing a field were blown apart by a drone while playing in a field, the official comment being that they were ‘digging,’ just like actual terrorists dig. By that logic, everyone is a target. Reply Douglas Ernst says: September 24, 2013 at 10:48 am Thanks for reading and commenting, Jay. Yes, your very valid points have added a dimension to the subject Dave’s lacked. In regards to NSA spying, I think Dave would benefit from reading about real police states, where “boring” conversations routinely get people thrown into gulags. ‘Escape from Camp 14′ is an eye-opening book.

Penn was the keynote speaker at the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s Asian Pacific American Heritage Festival. Each year, APASA and its member organizations celebrate their culture with other students and to promote Asian Pacific American awareness as a whole on campus. Penn, known for starring as Kumar Patel in the Harold & Kumar movies and as Dr. Lawrence Kutner on the TV show House, served as an associate director and liaison for Asian American and Pacific Islander policy in the White House Office of Public Engagement between 2009 and 2011, with a break in 2010 to film A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas. He also served as a co-chair for President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign. Penn said while media is beginning to incorporate a more diversified outlook, the stereotypical cultures shown on everyday television shows still contrast what people see, observe and experience in their daily lives. “There are still some pretty big sociological differences between what we see in the media and what we see in real life,” Penn said. “The rest of America doesn’t look like what happens when you turn on the TV.” Though critical of it, Penn acknowledged that the media is slowly evolving to portray diversity in its true forms and dimensions. “If you look at representation and diversity in the media, you’ll notice that, generally speaking, there aren’t a whole lot of characters who look like me,” Penn said. “Historically speaking, it’s been a lack of willingness by big media companies to produce and cast things in a color-blind manner but, recently, the trend has been rapidly changing in the last five to ten years.” As an Asian American and Pacific Islander liaison for the White House, Penn said his job was no different than what million of people do everyday. “It’s not that much different than what a lot of you guys are doing,” Penn said. “Your fraternities and sororities that tutor once a week, or ethnic organizations that organize food drives — all of that was no different than my job of getting every federal agency that had had a program related to the Asian American or Pacific Islander community to regularly meet with a commission from the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.” Andrew Dippel, a senior majoring in business administration, said he enjoyed hearing Penn speak because of Penn’s experience as a public servant. “You hear a lot about the Asian Pacific community, but you don’t really hear too many people that have direct experience working to benefit the community.” Dippel said. “It was refreshing to hear someone who has dealt with the issue personally.” Ke-Lwun Yee, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, said Penn’s story was inspiring and that, though progress needed to be made, it was refreshing to hear Penn deliver the message. “[Asian Americans] aren’t really portrayed in the media that often,” Yee said. “So it’s nice to know that there’s someone on the other side that’s willing to come talk to students about his successful journey as an Asian-American figure in the entertainment industry.” Also in the Daily Trojan: Kip Fulbeck discusses race, identity Penn talks back APASS launches initiative Kal Penn visits USC to raise Democratic support Kiffin declines to comment on reports linking USC to Penn State running back Tags This article is tagged: apasa, Harold & Kumar, Kal Penn, President Barack Obama, white house Comments are closed.

House tortures his own mind trying to understand why because it doesn't make any sense. Begins abusing Vicodin even worse. House eventually drives himself crazy due to Kal Pen's character death and abusing Vicodin and is put into a mental hospital because he disconnects from reality. Over-simplified but that's the ELI5 version. Edit: Forgot vicodin. Double edit side note way too late. It does make complete sense though. Even though we know Kal Pen's character killed himself because Kal Pen went to work at the White House, within the show it made no sense what so ever. And when your main character is OBSESSED with understanding everyone close to him of course he'll drive himself crazy trying to understand a death that happened because of decisions made OUTSIDE the House MD universe.

He was trying to turn out the youth vote (which obviously leans left). Good strategy for Obama. He took a Q and A after the speech. Some people asked about the administration's policies. He said the standard things, "The administration strives to improve blah blah etc." Some people asked him about acting. House was a fantastic experience and Hugh Laurie was a great person, he said. Then some guy in the audience stood up and screamed "WHY HAVE YOU NOT ANSWERED THE QUESTION I SUBMITTED ABOUT THE 9/11 ATTACKS?! HAVE YOU SEEN THE FOOTAGE OF BUILDING SEVEN?? IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A CONTROLLED DEMOLITION!!" Kal just looked at him like "wtf" and then calmly answered as best he could. I went to a few speeches that year and that fucking guy was at every fucking speech asking the same question. I don't know why they kept letting him in.

But I do remember a standup special on comedy central (I used to watch a lot of standup on comedy central) in which he had a joke about how even though he wasn't Mexican everybody in the US considers him to Mexican because of stereotypes and what not. Of course the point of the joke, which was noxious, was that stereotypes are good and we should all love them unconditionally. Then came the trite recitations of various racial and ethnic stereotypes. I'm pretty sure he ends the set up preaching about 9/11. Oh, and he said that he felt no pity for starving people in 3rd world countries because "anyone can come to america" so it's there own fault they're starving for not coming here. It remains amongst the dumbest things I've ever heard, and one of the worst standup special I've ever seen. I think I had a point when I started this post, but it's gone. Carlos Mencia is terrible.
