Pa., during a bus tour of natural-gas drilling sites in northeastern Pennsylvania. Ono and Lennon have formed a group called Artists Against Fracking, which has become the main celebrity driven anti-fracking organization. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) ALBANY, N.Y. — Artists Against Fracking said Monday neither the group nor Yoko Ono or Sean Lennon have been told to register as lobbyists in their campaign against gas drilling in New York, but will if necessary to continue their work. A good-government advocate and two lobbying experts said the state should review whether Artists Against Fracking and its supporter-celebrities should be registered as lobbyists. The group and nearly 200 entertainers connected with it aren't currently registered lobbyists, a search by The Associated Press of the database of the state Joint Commission on Public Ethics shows. Registration would require disclosure of how much money the group has raised and how it's been spent – a measure intended as a way for the public to know who is influencing public policy. David Fenton, a spokesman for the group, said it would have no objection if required to register. "Yoko and Sean, as true with many New Yorkers, have expressed concerns about fracking, participated in the submission of comments to the Department of Environmental Conservation, and visited Albany with their own resources," Fenton said. "As such, neither Yoko, Sean, nor their Artists Against Fracking endeavor have been required to be registered lobbyists. If there is a need to register, of course, that will occur." Over the years, several celebrities or their groups have been required to register as lobbyists. But whether celebrities must register hinges on its specific circumstances. The line between lobbying and free speech isn't bright or clear. Under state law, a lobbyist is defined as any person or organization "employed, retained" in "any attempt to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation ... or approval or disapproval of any legislation by the governor." That can include nonprofit groups and their unpaid advocates. The activists, among them actors Mark Ruffalo and Susan Sarandon, are trying to protect the environment from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The group says forcing water and chemicals deep into shale deposits to extract gas threatens drinking water and the environment. The group's website implores, "Tell Governor Cuomo: Don't Frack New York." "You spend money lobbying, you have to register," said David Grandeau, former executive director of the state lobbying commission and now an attorney representing lobbyists and clients. On Monday, after an AP article appeared on the group, he added: "It's clearly lobbying" and said the commission "missed the boat." A good-government advocate said the lobbying regulator, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, should look into the case. "When someone is trying to influence or change public opinion, there's always a concern if the public doesn't know exactly how much money they are spending to do that," said Barbara Bartoletti, of the League of Women Voters. "I don't know if they are splitting hairs between educating the public or lobbying." The commission can't confirm or deny it will take on any case, spokesman John Milgrim said. Ravi Batra, a former member of the commission board, called it an important issue. "When celebrities get involved in influencing public opinion, it behooves everyone to make sure the law is followed to the letter," he said. There's no public record of how much money Artists Against Fracking has spent, but its website contains links for visitors to make donations, which are directed to the Sustainable Markets Foundation. Although the foundation is an established charitable organization and its donations are recorded publicly, it isn't registered with New York as a lobbying client, either. Under New York law, however, it appears Artists Against Fracking is required to be a registered lobbyist because the law hinges on spending over $5,000. The group hasn't filed lobbying reports, so the amount it has spent and what it was spent on isn't known publicly. Experts in Albany say the website and public events appear to have cost well over $5,000. The widow and son of musician John Lennon recently attended an anti-fracking event in Albany with Ruffalo, actors Zooey Deschanel, Alec Baldwin and Hugh Jackman, and singer Lady Gaga, along with other longtime activists such as David Crosby and Paul McCartney. A week ago, Artists Against Fracking widely released a music video done through Skype from various locations featuring dozens of entertainers singing a Sean Lennon song, "Don't Frack My Mother." In it, Ono sings part of the chorus, "Don't frack me!" Failing to register as a lobbyist is not a criminal offense. Commonly, when a person new to lobbying is believed to have failed to lobby as required by law that person is given a chance to submit a lobbing form and pay a $200 fee. One of the main players supporting fracking, the Independent Oil & Gas Association of New York, is registered. Lobbying is big business in New York. The New York Public Interest Research Group reported that more than $220 million was spent lobbying in 2011 – and that was before the fracking debate really heated up. The biggest penalty for failure to follow the lobbying law resulted in a $250,000 fine against Donald Trump and others over casinos in 2000, and the Philip Morris tobacco company was hit with a $75,000 fine in 1999.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had evidence a gas company's drilling operation contaminated Lipsky's drinking water with explosive methane, and possibly cancer-causing chemicals, but withdrew its enforcement action, leaving the family with no useable water supply, according to a report obtained by The Associated Press. The EPA's decision to roll back its initial claim that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, operations had contaminated the water is the latest case in which the federal agency initially linked drilling to water contamination and then softened its position, drawing criticism from Republicans and industry officials who insisted they proved the agency was inefficient and too quick to draw conclusions.

digg reddit stumble Welcome again to my blog, Toxic Tracks. Please send along any feedback or ideas for environmental health topics via email or Twitter. With only weeks to go until Gov. Andrew Cuomo's Feb. 27 deadline to decide the fate of hydraulic fracturing in New York state, the anti-fracking community is stepping up its game. I reported last week from Binghamton, where activists launched a new campaign and asked to meet with Cuomo -- suggesting he'd already obliged for natural gas companies and warning him that opposition to the industry is mounting. In the new video below, unveiled by Artists Against Fracking and shot by Gasland director Josh Fox, Yoko Ono lays out how she sees the increasingly heated battle. "On one side is the gas companies -- big, big companies -- on the other side there is people," says Ono. "But people are eventually going to win, because people are eventually going to keep on increasing their knowledge, whereas the gas company has to keep on increasing their lies. And that's the big difference." She includes a familiar request for Cuomo: "Please meet us." Ono, fellow artists, and journalists (myself included) got a first-hand look last month at what may be at stake with Cuomo's looming decision. The video chronicles our bus tour of northeastern Pennsylvania, a region that's already accrued years of experience with natural gas operations. Of course, New York is not the only state contemplating whether or not to tap into its large volumes of shale gas -- nor is the U.S. the only country on the verge of such a monumental choice. "It would be so incredible if we can do something in the state of New York," says Ono in the video. "That might just create a precedent." People in favor of expanding natural gas production have shared with me their frustrations with anti-fracking activists, who they say are using "radical scare tactics" to thwart what could be a welcome boon for the country, as well as for struggling families and small businesses.

Artists Against Fracking opposes hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and boasts members including Yoko Ono and actors Mark Ruffalo and Susan Sarandon. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT The group says forcing water and chemicals deep into shale deposits to extract gas threatens drinking water and the environment. The group's website implores, "Tell Governor Cuomo: Don't Frack New York." But the group and nearly 200 entertainers who are gaining attention and support in the dispute, which is splitting New Yorkers, aren't registered lobbyists, according to a search by The Associated Press of the database of the state Joint Commission on Public Ethics. State law is designed to disclose who is trying to influence government action, how much money they are spending and where the money's going. "You spend money lobbying, you have to register," said David Grandeau, former executive director of the state lobbying commission and now an attorney representing lobbyists and clients. There's no public record of how much money Artists Against Fracking has spent, but its website contains links for visitors to make donations, which are directed to the Sustainable Markets Foundation. Although the foundation is an established charitable organization and its donations are recorded publicly, it isn't registered with New York as a lobbying client, either. Under New York law, however, it appears Artists Against Fracking is required to be a registered lobbyist because the law hinges on spending over $5,000. The group hasn't filed lobbying reports, so the amount it has spent and what it was spent on isn't known publicly. Experts in Albany say the website and public events appear to have cost well over $5,000. The group hasn't responded to requests for comment in the past two weeks. The group's account executive at its public relations firm, Fenton of New York City, didn't respond to a request for comment. The group includes Ono and Sean Lennon, the widow and son of musician John Lennon. They recently attended an anti-fracking event in Albany with Ruffalo, actors Zooey Deschanel, Alec Baldwin and Hugh Jackman, and singer Lady Gaga, along with other longtime activists such as David Crosby and Paul McCartney. None of them are registered to lobby in New York. A week ago, Artists Against Fracking widely released a music video done through Skype from various locations featuring dozens of entertainers singing a Sean Lennon song, "Don't Frack My Mother." In it, Ono sings part of the chorus, "Don't frack me!" Failing to register as a lobbyist is not a criminal offense. Commonly, when a person new to lobbying is believed to have failed to lobby as required by law to track the influence of money on public policy, that person is given a chance to submit a lobbing form and pay a $200 fee. One of the main players supporting fracking, the Independent Oil & Gas Association of New York, is registered. Lobbying is big business in New York. The New York Public Interest Research Group reported that more than $220 million was spent lobbying in 2011 — and that was before the fracking debate really heated up. The biggest penalty for failure to follow the lobbying law resulted in a $250,000 fine against Donald Trump and others over casinos in 2000, and the Philip Morris tobacco company was hit with a $75,000 fine in 1999. Over the years, several celebrities or their groups have been required to register as lobbyists. But whether celebrities must register hinges on its specific circumstances. The line between lobbying and free speech isn't bright or clear, and the Joint Commission on Public Ethics wouldn't comment; it referred the AP to the law for clarification. Under state law, a lobbyist is defined as any person or organization "employed, retained" in "any attempt to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation ... or approval or disapproval of any legislation by the governor." That can include nonprofit groups and their unpaid advocates. In the fracking case, the Assembly and the Senate Independent Democratic Conference have introduced laws that would delay a pending decision on drilling by Cuomo. Grandeau was in charge when, in 2005, the lobbying commission accepted a $5,000 payment to settle a case against a coalition that included hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, former NAACP head Benjamin Chavis and the former federal housing secretary — Andrew Cuomo. The commission had insisted The Coalition for Fairness, which aimed at relaxing long sentences for drug offenses, was lobbying, while the coalition said it was exercising its right to free speech. Earlier in 2005, an appellate court ruled Simmons and Chavis had failed to disclose how much they spent on a 2003 rally against the drug laws. The ethics commission "does not comment on or confirm matters that may or may not be before it," said spokesman John Milgrim. "But laws requiring lobbyists and their clients to publicly disclose their lobbying are well known and the commission expects compliance."   + FollowFOX411 on Facebook Advertisement Trending in Entertainment 1 Can you quit a show when you don't like the character? 2 Swim week swimsuit shockers 3 Grande kept big secret 4 Celebrity scale: Skinny or curvy? 5 Hall: The truth shall set you free See all Trends ON OUR RADAR Portia reeling over Ellen affair?

The group will air a winning TV ad from its #DontFrackNY video contest next week. Below, Yoko Ono’s new television spot in response to NY Gov. Cuomo’s silence and his upcoming Feb. 27 deadline for a decision on fracking. The ad features Ono directly addressing the Governor, a response to her unmet requests for meetings. “Gov. Cuomo, since you haven’t met with me about the dangers of fracking, I will show you. PS: Nice to meet you, Governor,” Ono says in the ad. "After visiting with families in Pennsylvania whose water, homes and lives have been hurt by the gas industry, I wanted to show Gov. Cuomo and the public what I saw," she says. "He must know what could happen to New Yorkers -- our air, our water, our climate -- if he allows fracking." <iframe class="embedly-embed" src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Feph0kUgHUNg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Deph0kUgHUNg&image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Feph0kUgHUNg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=cd9e4f06431d4d5cb4fa3e4a1368b789&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube&autoplay=1" width="500" height="281" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe Discuss 28 Responses to “Gimme Some Truth: short doc on fracking, with Artists Against Fracking, and Yoko Ono” bkad says: February 7, 2013 at 10:29 am Thanks for a post on fracking. It’s largely a rural issue so it doesn’t always get much attention. Reply Riff Conner says: February 7, 2013 at 10:54 am I initially parsed that as Artists Against (Fracking and Yoko Ono) and thought it sounded like an odd combination of things for a single organization to be protesting. Reply Joe Gilbert says: February 7, 2013 at 11:27 am What does it say about me that when I first read the sign I saw it as a Battlestar reference? Fracking media…. Reply DJBudSonic says: February 7, 2013 at 12:30 pm I support their attempts to limit or stop hydraulic fracturing in gas and oil wells, simply because the chemicals being injected into the ground will at some point make their way into the water table.  The risks of permanent damage to the earths fresh water supply outweighs the benefits of extending well life and production.  Read some industry publications about the geology and the process of hydraulic fracturing and see if it sounds safe.  Because oil and gas extraction is a lucrative and highly competitive industry the formulas for the fracturing lubricants and abrasives are constantly changing and considered trade secrets. Who knows what is being injected into the rock layers at high pressure?   The Marcellus Shale is enormous, they will go after every last bit of it.  There are great economic pressures in favor of this.  80 trillion cubic feet?  For sale to the highest bidder, foreign or domestic, believe it. But the bottom line is, do you trust Halliburton and the rest to keep our water clean? Reply yoshua says: February 7, 2013 at 12:40 pm The legitimate, documented problems with drinking water supplies have been a result of faulty well casings near the surface, not some issue with the fracking itself. Activists just like to group it all under the label of “fracking” because it sounds sinister. You can run into the exact same problems with conventional wells. The problem isn’t fracking specifically. It is drilling for hydrocarbons in general.

Reply class_enemy says: February 8, 2013 at 5:52 am I have a gas well on my property, about 800 feet from my house, drilled three years ago using fracking.  My drinking water, and that of my neighbors, has been tested and is just fine. But the problem is that since the drop in natural gas prices, I have seen my monthly royalty check drop from almost $2000 to about a third of that. So my wife has suggested that we become environmental activists, opposing not only fracking but demanding the closing of coal mines and coal fired power plants.  I’m considering this.  We sure don’t want to see a continued gas glut! Reply empirechick says: February 7, 2013 at 10:48 am For the 25 families in my little town whose wells went bad ALL AT ONCE when fracking began, I assure you this IS a real issue. Reply CliffordS says: February 7, 2013 at 10:50 am Can you be more specific please about what you mean by real issues?   Reply wysinwyg says: February 7, 2013 at 11:13 am Well you’re currently presented with the opportunity to focus on those issues by mentioning them in your comment but you apparently decided not to do that.  You also decided to poo poo the idea that fracking affects the quality of aquifers without bothering to provide an argument. Yes, we can focus on the real issues.  Why can’t you? Reply Beth Redmond Walsh says: February 7, 2013 at 11:26 am Scare campaign, huh?  As long as the water that comes out of YOUR faucets doesn’t burn I guess everything is just OK, right?  To hell with people who have no power to control what other people are doing to the water THOSE dumbass bumpkins have to drink. Bet you’re thinking ‘thank god I’m not one of them’.  Sure. Enjoy your life.  Reply Isaac Rinke says: February 7, 2013 at 11:27 am The real issue seems to be that the a number of wells are contracted out to poorly managed companies or drilled by speculators who often botch the job. Hydraulic fracturing has been in use since the 1960′s, but we are hearing more about it due to an increase in drilling as a result of the recent boom. While almost all wells are contracted anymore, this little speech from There Will Be Blood does a good job of giving insight into the matter. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho8OObimdtw Reply wysinwyg says: February 7, 2013 at 12:06 pm Is there another alternative – and is that alternative feasible politically and economically? Continuing to live the lifestyles we take for granted in the “first world” isn’t actually feasible economically in the first place.  Since that’s the only reason we “need” energy I simply reject the premises of your argument. We are going to need energy, is it better to have this kind of development in our communities – where we can watch it – or far out in the wilderness where there are no watchful eyes? What an incredibly disingenuous question.  “Watchful eyes” are only useful to the extent that their observations are believed and acted upon.  And yet you make this argument in the context of denying the truth of first-hand observations of the communities in question.  Your reason for joining this argument is to try to get people to shut their “watchful eyes” or at least to try to discredit any observation they make that’s inconvenient for your pre-existing biases. If you really believed this “watchful eyes” nonsense you’d be taking the accounts of affected communities more seriously rather than dismissing them out of hand. Incidentally, pseudonymous accounts by partisans on Reddit does not count as “information about fracking.”  It’s a lot more likely to be “propaganda about fracking”.  Yes, both sides of the issue can issue propaganda.  Fancy that. Reply chenille says: February 7, 2013 at 12:39 pm We are going to need energy… This is at once something that’s true and a huge warning, because you only hear it when people want to ignore environmental or human rights abuses. Solar and wind advocates never say it. People who trully believe in nuclear rarely say it, they’d rather try to persuade us how much safer new plants are. But every time somebody rips up a national park or poisons a coastline, suddenly their apologists need to remind us that “we’re going to need energy”. Look, we all know that, ok? We just don’t believe it should be a catch-all excuse, the way it always seems to be employed. That site might be informed, but it’s wholly unreasonable. The author discusses whether methane coming out of a tap is biogenic or thermogenic, but ignores the question of why it started coming out. They only compare the best case of fracking as cleanly and safely as possible against using coal and nukes with no such efforts – but of course, the only reason there would be such a case is because people are worried about it. And finally, “America is one of the most progressive nations on safety and environmental standards” has nothing to do with whether our safety and environment are being covered, and depends on who you compare them to. Again, we all know China and Arabia are worse, ok? It’s not the point. If you actually wanted a reasonable discussion, this is nothing like the place to start. Reply wysinwyg says: February 7, 2013 at 12:14 pm That’s a really, really stupid argument.  “If you’re against animal cruelty that’s fine.  Just eat vegan and don’t wear any clothes at all since it’s certain that animals were harmed at some point in their manufacture.”  “If you’re against war that’s fine.  Just don’t live in any country whose borders were decided by warfare at some past date.”  “If you’re against rape that’s fine but since you probably have an ancestor who is the product of rape somewhere in your lineage as a matter of probability that would make you an uninformed hypocrite.” Reply wysinwyg says: February 7, 2013 at 12:17 pm But what is your evidence that the gas in that water is caused by fracking? The timing seems awfully suspicious, don’t you think?  Given the possibility of serious harm I would think it would make sense to put some of the burden of evidence on the pro-fracking side to adduce evidence that it’s really as safe as astroturfers advocates such as yourself insist. Reply cegev says: February 7, 2013 at 12:50 pm I think what Kristopher is suggesting here is not that what’s going on has nothing to do with fracking, but that it instead might be a more general issue with the work going on around the fracking. That even if fracking itself were more restricted or banned entirely, the processes it is used to enhance would still cause major environmental impact. By focusing on fracking, environmentalists are therefore not really striking at the base issues, and instead going after something far less important. In that case, the timing is simply that fracking is allowing such work in new areas. And to some extent, I have to agree. Regardless of whether fracking causes environmental damage, large-scale petroleum and natural gas extraction causes significant environmental damage. The burning of those fuels causes significant environmental damage as well: greenhouse-gas induced climate change has a far, far larger potential to cause mass environmental damage than any claimed damage that fracking might cause.  In essence, one could argue that when people are focusing efforts against fracking, it is akin to someone in the 70s focusing efforts against some process used in CFC production. It might be bad, but the processes around it are bad too, and the end results are the biggest environmental problem. Reply wysinwyg says: February 7, 2013 at 12:57 pm I disagree with your reading of Kristopher. The burning of those fuels causes significant environmental damage as well: greenhouse-gas induced climate change has a far, far larger potential to cause mass environmental damage than any claimed damage that fracking might cause. Umm, the purpose of fracking is to produce fuels whose burning generates greenhouse gases.  It absolutely makes sense to take all that environmental damage into account when discussing fracking — both the damage due to extraction and the damage due to burning what was extracted. Edit: @Heather Cristofaro: Yes, I realize natural gas produces fewer emissions per calorie of energy than coal or oil. On the other hand, I think the danger and possibility of unintended consequences involved in fracturing bedrock and pumping the cracks full of toxic chemicals should be somehow addressed before we all get natural gas wells in our backyards. Incidentally, we are not “a world transitioning.” We are a world engaged in the same self-destructive patterns of behavior that we have been for the last century or so. Fracking is about keeping the party going, not about “transitioning” to a new low-energy way of life. Reply Heather Cristofaro says: February 7, 2013 at 2:14 pm  An emission-free energy source is always ideal, but for a world transitioning this should be noted before comparing natural gas to petroleum and coal (wikipedia for a simple quick reference): “For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 30 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum and about 45 per cent less than burning coal.[33][34] Coal-fired electric power generation emits around 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour generated, which is almost double the carbon dioxide released by a natural gas-fired electric plant per megawatt hour generated. Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation, as the fuel mix in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen. Those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992.” Reply chenille says: February 7, 2013 at 1:43 pm I’m not going to engage with you in any substantial way because I have better ways to spend my time… I expected you didn’t really mean the “I’d love to have a conversation with you”, given the dismissive framing, but thank you for clarifying. Reply wysinwyg says: February 7, 2013 at 2:01 pm Serious question, do you believe in other conspiracies? Fake space landing? 9/11 truther? Vaccines cause autism? Fake moon landing is less likely than a real moon landing so no.  (A space landing would seem to be an oxymoron.)  I don’t believe vaccines cause autism because there’s no evidence for and there is evidence against. 9/11 was a conspiracy whether you believe the US government’s account or not — a conspiracy of Islamist extremists to draw the US into an endless war during which civil liberties would be undermined, our military would be exhausted, and our government would become weighed down by debt to the point of default.  If the government’s account is correct, then this is a conspiracy that would seem to have been successfully carried out.  (I don’t think the government’s official story is entirely true but I think the bulk of truther claims are bullshit.) There are plenty of other historical examples of conspiracies.  There was a conspiracy to assassinate Hitler.  There was a conspiracy by wealthy North American colonists to rebel against British rule.  There was a conspiracy to blow up Parliament.  There is a very obvious and well-documented conspiracy by fossil-fuel companies to cast doubt on scientific climate research and downplay the dangers of petroleum extraction, refinement, and use.  That one’s pretty relevant here.  Are you trying to tell me the petroleum industry has no incentive to downplay or hide health and environmental problems that may be caused by their activities?  That’s not even Dunning-Kruger.  That’s straight-up cognitive dissonance. Incidentally, if you reread my comments you’ll notice I didn’t mention the film once.  Because I did not even watch it.  So no, I’m not equating those two things.  I’m pointing out that people who work in or who have worked in the fossil fuel industry may not be entirely honest or informed themselves.  Which is simply obvious if you’re not an ideologue. I suspect you’re “not going to engage” because I pointed out your “watchful eyes” comment was pure Cato Institute PR bullshit. Sorry, man, you can’t shill and expect not to be called on it. Reply Heather Cristofaro says: February 7, 2013 at 2:03 pm Thank you for posting against tons of NIMBY propaganda. My father works in alternative energy (wind, solar, cogeneration and microturbines), and he spent a weekend while we were camping explaining the fracking technology, the actual dangers and why it’s so much better than offshore drilling and importing. He’s been an environmental advocate all his life and the way the technology itself and not the business of drilling has been demonized really takes the focus off the issue. Reply wysinwyg says: February 7, 2013 at 2:04 pm I’m talking about the here and now, where people want iphones, computer and air conditioning. But we don’t need any of those things while we do need arable soil, potable water, and breathable air.  This is the fundamental problem with your argument.  It is entirely premised on the idea that we need to use all the energy we use now.  It’s simply not true. No one should be ripping up parks or poisoning coastlines. That’s not a matter of contention, by anyone. Except your buddies in the energy industry for whom you are doing so much footwork in this thread. If you have a feasable plan to get everyone off oil and gas, right now, I’m all ears. But until then, we need to live in this world. If you’ve got a feasible plan to get people off food, air, and water I’m all ears. But until then we need to live in this world. Reply chenille says: February 7, 2013 at 2:13 pm No one should be ripping up parks or poisoning coastlines. That’s not a matter of contention, by anyone. Actually, it is, because people do defend the practices that cause them every time they happen. And they use exactly the same language you’re using. We need the energy and now, other solutions are hard and this is so close because it’s what we’ve been investing in, the problems aren’t really that bad so you shouldn’t pay attention to them. All these are empty arguments you see for any questionable development. I want something that actually addresses particulars, without the pablum that applies just as well to any energy source we happen to have on hand. You want a feasible plan? All right, here’s one option – we start fracking. We start it on a small scale, and watch it carefully so we can accurately assess the real benefits and damages, the same as other potential energy technologies. And should those damages show up, we take them seriously and try to address them. Then we might be able to make a real case why this is a good way forward. I’d listen to that. Trying to bury potential problems under the standard old dismissals of nimbys and hippies, on the other hand, only insults us both. Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Andrew Cuomo to reject hydrofracking in New York, may not be giving all the truth about its activities. The Associated Press reports that Ono's group, Artists Against Fracking, is not registered as a lobbying group with the state. That means there's no way to track the group's spending and donors. "You spend money lobbying, you have to register," David Grandeau, former executive director of the state lobbying commission and now an attorney representing lobbyists and clients, told the AP. Under state law, groups that lobby state government must register if they spend at least $5,000. The AP says that Artists Against Fracking's website and public events have likely broken the $5,000 barrier. The group includes Ono, widow of the late Beatle John Lennon; their son, Sean Lennon; actors Mark Ruffalo, Zooey Deschanel and Alec Baldwin; and singers Lady Gaga, David Crosby and Paul McCartney. None of them is individually registered to lobby in New York, the AP says. Hydrofracking is still on hold in New York while the state Department of Environmental Conservation awaits the results of study by the state Department of Health.
