At Gettysburg, 20 percent of student education programs would be eliminated this spring. The Blue Ridge Parkway would lose 21 seasonal interpretive ranger programs, resulting in the closure of half of the park’s visitor stations and leaving 80 miles between each one. Mount Rainer would permanently close a key visitor center, and Glacier would delay the opening of a well-visited mountain pass. Five campgrounds and picnics area would close at the Great Smoky Mountains, affecting 54,000 visitors, and the Grand Tetons would close a visitor center, information station and preserve. These are some new details that have emerged this week of how the National Parks Service would implement a 5.1 percent across-the-board reduction if Congress does not avert $85 billion in spending cuts across the federal government. A Park Service memo obtained by park advocates and provided to The Washington Post outlines some of the cuts, which would affect direct services to visitors from grass cutting to access to rangers and mountain passes. The Post reported last Sunday that park advocates are pressuring Congress to avert a $110 million cut to the system, which would affect every park, from the National Mall to Yellowstone.

The National Park Service has to cut $134 million from sites around the country, including Yosemite, due to the lack of a budget deal in Congress. Gosia Wozniacka/AP Hikers walk on the Mist Trail to Vernal Fall at Yosemite National Park in California. The National Park Service has to cut $134 million from sites around the country, including Yosemite, due to the lack of a budget deal in Congress. Gosia Wozniacka/AP Spring has come early to the Yosemite Valley, and the melting snow makes for a spectacular rush of water off the granite face of Yosemite Falls, the tallest in North America. Early March is when park officials would normally be gearing up for the busy tourist season. Instead, they're figuring out how to cut $1.5 million from their budget. Without a budget deal, the sequestration has forced the Park Service to cut a total of $134 million from sites around the country. "Do we close a visitor center for the entire season, or do we just cut back hours?" says Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman. "Do we trim ranger-led programs so there's less programs here in Yosemite Valley, or do we keep the same amount and either have less or none at the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias?" All of these unanswered questions are weighing heavily on the minds of park managers, Gediman says. On a peak summer day, some 2,500 hikers pass through this forest just beneath the park's famed Half Dome. The park has backcountry rangers who patrol the area, provide safety messages, orientation and check for fire rings that are improperly built, among other things, Gediman says, but the park is planning to cut almost all of its backcountry rangers. They'll also hire fewer seasonal rangers and support staff. That means fewer people patrolling the trails and longer response times if there's an emergency. "Right now, we're in a pattern where Yosemite National Park, like all national parks, we're having to make some real difficult decisions," he says. Indeed, it's not just Yosemite feeling the squeeze. Picnic areas and campgrounds are expected to close in the Great Smoky Mountains; the visitor center at Cape Cod National Seashore probably won't open this summer, either. Out West, at Glacier and Yellowstone, the Herculean task of snow plowing the scenic highways that crisscross the mountains could be delayed by almost a month. "Visitors will still be able to enjoy national parks, they just won't have the same experience," says Joan Anzelmo, who spent much of her career at Yellowstone before joining the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees. Anzelmo is also worried that delayed openings and cuts to park services will hurt the tourist-dependent towns outside the parks.

In the Yosemite Valley, a lot of visitors are saying the same thing. "I think it's ridiculous; I think it's a joke," said park visitor Emelia Davern of New York, as she prepared for the long climb up the Upper Yosemite Falls Trail. "Everyone's so headstrong right now, and it's so divided, but I think they don't see the impact that it actually has," she says. Nearby, along the Merced River, Christine Nichols said she understands that the poor economy calls for belt-tightening. But she's not sure parks like this can afford to cut back anymore. "Being in an environment like this, if you keep cutting back, eventually that directly impacts how safely people are going to be in nature," Nichols says. "It's not like you can just cut back and be more efficient when you're trying to cover a huge wild area." And it's a huge wild area that sees on average 4 million visitors a year. But park officials are used to budget cuts, and they plan to lean on extra volunteers and more money from private groups to help them get through the summer.

National Park Service prepares for sequester cuts Chuck Raasch, USA TODAY 9:27 p.m. EDT March 11, 2013 A shuttle boat heads into the dock on Jenny Lake at the base of the Teton Mountains. (Photo: USA TODAY file) Story Highlights Yellowstone will cut back on snow plowing, will hire fewer seasonal workers Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland may close its visitor center Hiring freeze in effect for National Park Service 610 CONNECT 116 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 108 COMMENT EMAIL MORE National park supervisors are preparing to open roads later, close visitor centers, furlough park police and hire fewer seasonal workers to meet the 5% sequestration budget cuts mandated by Congress and President Obama. National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis issued a memo Friday stating that about 1,000 fewer seasonal workers will be hired this year, down from 10,000 last year. In a memo to Park Service employees, he said furloughs should be expected among park police, and that a $12 billion backlog in park maintenance will worsen. There were an estimated 279 million visitors to national parks in 2011, the last year figures were available. Visitors this year are already seeing sequestration-related cuts; at some sites, the 5% reduction will be less obvious right away: -- The National Capital Region, which oversees parks and Civil War battlefields in and around Washington, D.C., is contemplating everything from less lawn-mowing and garbage pickup in Rock Creek Park to limiting hours of, or closing altogether, the visitor center at Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland, according to Park Service spokeswoman Jennifer Mummart. She said the region may hire only half the 400-450 seasonal employees it normally does. -- At the Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts, Superintendent George Price said park oversees are contemplating closing the Province Lands Visitor Center, which was visited by 260,000 tourists during the summer last year. The number of seasonal hires will probably be reduced by 22 from the 150-200 normally hired, Price said. -- At the Grand Tetons National Park in Wyoming, the Park Service is contemplating closing three of five visitor centers, and cutting seasonal hires from 180 last year to about 150 this year. "Intense management meetings" are underway to "nail down what we will have to do without," Grand Tetons spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs said. -- At Yellowstone National Park, where 3.4 million people visited last year, snow-plowing that is necessary to open the park has already been delayed by two weeks, until next Monday. Park officials hope that more snow will melt to save the $10,000 a day it costs to plow the vast park's roads and entrances. "Our goal is to have minimal impacts on visitors," Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash said. But he said that park officials will have to hire fewer seasonal workers, which will mean "fewer maintenance staff, fewer law enforcement rangers, fewer interpretive rangers."

(Photo: Colin Kelly for USA TODAY) -- In Alaska, Denali National Park Superintendent Don Striker, who has been on the job less than two months, said he expects to meet his 5% cuts by freezing hiring. He is not filling positions for park historian and head of information technology and a half dozen in maintenance but said that others, like search and rescue personnel, won't be affected. But Striker said going without IT support can only last so long, and that "you can delay cleaning out gutter for while, but if you do it too long you lose the roof. "We are going to be OK in the short term but less okay as the months stack up," he said. Striker said he is more worried about the prospects of a government shutdown if Congress and Obama can't come to an agreement by March 27, when a temporary budget agreement is set to expire. Late March is when he and superintendents in many parks hire seasonal workers, and Striker said uncertainty then could be far more difficult than dealing with 5% cuts today. Jarvis instituted a travel ban for the Park Service for March, and said a hiring freeze would remain on about 900 unfilled permanent positions. The NPS has about 15,000 permanent employees. "Every activity will be affected" by the 5% cuts, he wrote, from controlling invasive species to police work. The Park Service's $2.86 billion annual budget has remained relatively flat since 2008. 610 CONNECT 116 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 108 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/YekVhA USA NOW Chokehold fury escalates with new video | USA NOW Jul 24, 2014 <% if ((typeof data.image_1_1 !== 'undefined') && data.image_1_1.length > 0) { %><% } %> Recommended for you <%= data.title %>✖ <% if ((typeof image !== 'undefined') && image.length > 0) { %> <% } %> <% if ((typeof section !== 'undefined') && section.length > 0) { %><%= section %><% } %> <% if ((typeof headline !== 'undefined') && headline.length > 0) { %><%= headline %><% } %>

Mandatory spending cuts could affect the number of tours offered in national parks across the country, like this one in Kentucky's Mammoth Cave National Park. Photograph by David S. Boyer and Arlan R. Wiker, National Geographic Kenneth Brower for National Geographic News Published February 28, 2013 Lovers of the United States' landscape, wildlife, and parks will feel the pain of mandatory spending cuts set to take effect this Friday, warn leaders of the nation's land agency. At a press conference just days short of the March 1 deadline, Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, outlined how so-called "sequestration" will hurt the country in general and national parks in particular. (See pictures of the top ten national park landmarks.) 1. Hits to the national wallet. The national parks return more than $10 for every dollar invested by the taxpayer, Salazar pointed out. The park system is a profit center as productive as any in our economy. In 2011, Maine's Acadia National Park drew 2.4 million visitors, contributed $186 million to the state's economy, and supported 3,000 jobs. Yellowstone National Park drew 3.4 million visitors, contributed $333 million, and supported 5,000 jobs. Everglades National Park drew 934,000 visitors, contributed $147 million, and supported 2,400 jobs.  And these are just three of the 398 national parks, monuments, memorials, reserves, preserves, historic sites, seashores, lakeshores, and battlefields across the country. "In 2011," summarized Salazar, "279 million visitors came to our national parks, pumped 30 billion dollars into the economy, and supported 252,000 jobs." The report for 2012, just out, shows that park visitation grew by three million, to 283 million. The park system is also doing its part to address the U.S. trade imbalance. Last year, according to Salazar, the parks drew 62 million international visitors and $152 million in foreign capital. International visitors stay longer in the parks and spend more. Before the specter of sequester rose, the Park Service set a goal of attracting a hundred million foreign visitors by the end of 2021. (See National Geographic's recommendations for the best national park hikes.) The sequester will require a 5 percent cut in the budget of each park.  While this might not seem like a devastating percentage, the secretary said, in fact it would strike at the heart of the limited discretionary funds available to the Park Service. In the context of the Department of Interior as a whole, he said, it would be like closing down the entire Bureau of Land Management. 2. Campground and cave closures in the Southeast. As examples of the belt-tightening required of every park to achieve a 5 percent cut, Director Jarvis picked the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where five campgrounds and picnic areas will be closed; the Blue Ridge Parkway, where seven contact stations will shut down; and Mammoth Cave National Park, where a portion of the cave tours will be eliminated. That may be good news for the bats, but not for the hundreds of thousands of visitors who explore these caverns each year. 3. Unhappy kids in the Northeast. At Cape Cod National Park, the Provincetown Visitor Center will be closed. At Independence National Historical Park, the interpretive program will be cut in half. "And at Gettysburg," said Jarvis, "this year being the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, we'll be reducing our education programs. Twenty-four hundred kids from the towns in the area will not be able to participate."  (See vintage photos of the national parks.) 4.  Empty silos in the Midwest. The Minuteman Missile Site in South Dakota will close all tours, turning away 50,000 annual visitors. The Cold War, in that sense, will grow a little colder. 5.  Snowy park roads in the West. The month of March, just as the sequester would hit, is when many parks open. It's also when the National Park Service hires "seasonals," the men and women who fight fires, provide extra law enforcement for peak months, and do search-and-rescue-hiring that will have to be curtailed. Also in March, water systems are reactivated and snowy roads are plowed. "In the Rocky Mountain region, in Yellowstone and Glacier, we will be delaying plowing of the roads to open those up, sometimes as much as a month," Jarvis said. "That delay will have a direct impact on gateway communities around Cody or Jackson Hole, or up in Glacier at Whitefish. The communities there, they know their season starts the day the roads open and closes the day the roads close. That can be as much as a million dollars a day lost to the local economy." At Grand Teton National Park, the Jenny Lake Visitor Center will close. In Yosemite, plowing of the Tioga Road, a principal route over the Sierra Nevada, will be delayed, affecting 2,000 to 3,000 travelers a day.  Delays in plowing the road to Wonder Lake, in Alaska's Denali National Park, will affect as many as 4,000 visitors a day. 6.  Thistles and pythons and carp and wild boars. Jarvis reminded the press that national parks need constant defending from invasive plants and animals. Funding cuts will compromise control programs throughout the park system, he said, including efforts to remove yellow star thistle from Yosemite, Burmese pythons from the Everglades, and feral pigs from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. People planning to visit national parks in the months ahead are urged to check the National Park Service's website for information on closures.

It makes me sick! C. Duafala 5pts I feel bad for some of the towns associated with these parks/centers. For a lot of the towns, this is the money making industry. Most of the actual towns left where I live are like this and their industry is nature tourism. When this leaves, the town dies for good.  craig Oxford 5pts You know I would like to see what their budget was last year abd compare to the money and budget they get this year.  Let's see if it passes the pinochio test! John C. 5pts The $85 billion so-called spending cut is actually budget authority, not budget outlays. According to the CBO, budget outlays will come down by $44 billion, or one quarter of 1 percent of GDP (GDP is $15.8 trillion). What’s more, that $44 billion outlay reduction is only 1.25 percent of the $3.6 trillion government. Also, these so-called cuts come off a rising budget baseline in most cases. So the sequester would slow the growth of spending. These are not real cuts in the level of spending. So the sequester that Obama insisted be put into law is not the end of the world as we know it, despite the wailing of government bureaucrats far and wide.

For the National Park Service, that means taking five percent, or $134 million, from its budget. While that doesn't seem like a big number to some, the cut comes mid-year (October 1 is the federal government's fiscal year), meaning it may actually feel like a 10 percent cut as most parks head into their busy summer season. Should the sequester happen, each of Park Service's 398 units were tasked with developing budget cut plans, something NPS Director Jon Jarvis in a memo this week described as "a grim reality of how we will have to reduce the level of direct services we provide to the American people in parks and communities across the country." Of course, the sequestration deadline is happening the very week the Park Service released its annual economic impact study. The peer-reviewed report, put together by Michigan State University, found that visitors generated $30.1 billion in economic activity and supported 252,000 jobs nationwide in 2011. More than one-third of that spending -- $13 billion -- went into communities within 60 miles of a park, the report found. In California, home to more national parks than any other state, the numbers crunch down to this: 35 million visitors, $1.4 billion spent, and 21,500 jobs. How sequestration affects this year's economic impact is yet to be seen, but as SoCal Wanderer discovered in discussions with over 10 of the biggest parks in the state, it's likely there will be some. What follows is a detailing of each of those parks' planning in the case of the budget cut. Take note, however: Even if the sequester does occur, the following may change because solutions can be fluid. Story Continues Below Support KCET The bear problem could get worse in Yosemite. | Photo: Ricardo Giaviti/Flickr/ Creative Commons License Yosemite National Park 2012 Visitation: 3.8 Million; 17th most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $379 million The opening of Glacier Point and Tioga roads could be delayed by more than a month as part of budget-cutting plan is to not plow snow so early in the season (the roads traditionally open around Memorial Day weekend). Tioga is a critical artery, serving as the park's only eastern entrance for vehicles; it averages 60,000 a month, generating about $1.2 million in entrance fees. This also means five campgrounds along Tioga and one along Glacier Point will see delayed openings. Additionally, the plan calls for fewer rangers, meaning -- possibly -- fewer of a lot of things: ranger-led programs, volunteers, junior ranger activities, trash pickup, and campground patrols. The last two on that list could translate to more bear interactions. With fewer campground patrols, rangers have less of an opportunity to educate the public on keeping bears away (yes, your toothpaste needs to go into bear bins, too), and more trash in cans speaks for itself. Lastly, Jarvis highlighted another threat in his memo to all park employees this week: "Our capacity to respond to new threats from invasive species will be cut in half and previous investments in eradication will be endangered; at Yosemite, more than $2.5 million spent in recent years to remove/control aggressive species as yellow star thistle, Italian thistle and Himalayan blackberry will be wasted if those plants reestablish their hold and increase their threat to native ecosystems." Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area 2012 Visitation: 649,471; 96th most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $26 million Cuts possibly mean big reductions -- either delay or elimination -- for youth programming, a critical component of this Los Angeles metro park's mission to serve undeserved communities. A total of 6,000 young people participate each year, 1,000 of whom who are enrolled in service learning (that's like losing 1,000 volunteers). The City Project's Robert Garcia provides great context for such effects in a post from his KCET Departures column Green Justice. Additionally, the park is planning to defer maintenance, meaning they'll shift away from preventative maintenance and focus on pressing needs. The long term effect of this is adding to the already $6.7 million deferred maintenance tab. Channel Islands National Park 2012 Visitation: 249,594; 169th most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $22.3 million Like the Santa Monica Mountains, this park may see impacts on its main education program, Channel Islands Live, which serves about 12,000 people (mostly students) by directly connecting Ventura County classrooms to rangers on the island via live, interactive video. To be clear, it's not the program that's being cut, but an earlier hiring freeze prevented the park from filling the position; now that vacant position will be used to meet the park's five percent reduction. Three other key positions will remain vacant as well: a wildlife biologist, a transit manager (key to getting employees, scientists, supplies, and trash from the mainland and the five islands), and a seabird biologist (one of the primary purposes of this park was to keep tab on these bird populations). Ranger programs have already been modified at Joshua Tree National Park. | Photo: David Fulmer/Flickr/ Creative Commons License Joshua Tree National Park 2012 Visitation: 1.4 million; 53rd most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $50 million Unlike most parks, Joshua Tree's desert environs provides for a busy winter season, so knowing that a midyear cut would leave very little work with, staff conserved money early on by cutting down on or modifying ranger programs and discretionary spending. Other than that, they are delaying new hires. The visitor center at Hole-in-the-Wall. | Photo: Amanda Scheliga/Flickr/ Creative Commons License Mojave National Preserve 2012 Visitation: 352,00; 142nd most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $12.5 million Another desert park here, but a different approach to cuts. The number of seasonal employees will be reduced, affecting visitor center hours. Kelso Depot, which serves about 14,000 people annually and is open every day, will probably close two days a week; Hole-in-the-Wall visitor center will go from its current five-day schedule to weekends only (in the summers, it's only open three days). Clearing roads after flooding events in Death Valley could take longer. | Photo: Endlisnis/Flickr/ Creative Commons License Death Valley National Park 2012 Visitation: 984,000; 72nd most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $50 million Like Channel Islands, Death Valley will fulfill its cuts by continuing to not hire three vacant positions, two which the public may feel when emergencies occur. When there's a power outage, there will be no electrician on staff to quickly respond (how appropriate, considering it's latest designation). And if there is flooding, there will be no roads person to clear and reopen roads. Those jobs can be done on contract, but will take longer to be completed. And add the fact that Death Valley's is the largest park in the continental U.S. -- it takes awhile to get anywhere. Cedar Grove in Kings Canyon National Park. | Photo: Frank Kovalchek/Flickr/ Creative Commons License Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks 2012 Visitation: 1.7 million combined; 63rd and 105th most visited units in the system, respectively 2011 Visitor Spending: $122 million combined The contingency plan for these two neighboring parks possibly includes delaying a road opening to the popular Cedar Grove area, visitor center hours being reduced by over 2,000 hours, reduction of ranger-led programs by 640 (affecting over 19,000 visitors), and fewer ranger contacts (an estimated 25,000) to the public in general. And like Yosemite, bear management could be affected. Snowshoeing will be the only option if road clearing is delayed at Lassen Volcanic. | Photo: LassenNPS/Flickr Lassen Volcanic National Park 2012 Visitation: 407,000; 135th most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $15.8 million The public will notice a projected two week delay in opening of the 30-mile Lassen Park Highway, which in turn delays the opening of eight campgrounds. All told, an estimated $156,000 in revenue will be lost. Additionally, some 1,100 local students will lose participation in programs due to a two-day-a-week closure of the visitor center. Road maintenance could be delayed in parks of Redwood National Park. | Photo: Linda Tanner/Flickr/ Creative Commons License Redwood National Park 2012 Visitation: 352,000; 142nd most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $20 million Vacant positions at this park will lead the loss of the seasonal park newspaper guide and less road work, including for a key one to Tall Trees Grove. Other effects include fewer campfire programs, ranger-led hikes, and the delay in opening (or closing) of the Hiouchi Visitor Center at the northern end of the park (it serves about 41,00 visitors every year). And from Jarvis' memo: "At Redwood, the inability to fill the park's hydrologic technician position will lead to a degradation of the park's long-term hydrologic record. The park will be unable to collect water quality data that supports Clean Water Act Section 303(d) monitoring and directives from Congress contained in the 1978 Redwood Act." Fort Point Visitor Center could be shuttered. | Photo: David Yu/Flickr/ Creative Commons License Golden Gate National Recreation Area 2012 Visitation: 14.5 million; 2nd most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $290 million Park staff are looking at a broad range of opportunities in cutting the budget across this popular park in the San Francisco Bay area. Most notable will be the likely reduction of hours or closure of visitor centers at Marin Headlands, Fort Berry, and Fort Point. Other effects will be felt in maintenance, public programs, and trash can collection. Pinnacles National Park 2012 Visitation: 224,000; 173rd most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $8.4 million The majority of cuts for the newest "national park" in the system are like many others: continuing to leave vacant positions as is. That possibly means a loss of ranger programs, the cancellation of the park science camp for school children, fewer trail patrols, and the deterioration of trails. Also, it may be harder to fix any breaks in the fence surrounding the park, meant to keep out feral pigs that eat native plant species. Maintaining Cabrillo's collection of diverse species could be threatened. | Photo: Daniel Peckham/Flickr/ Creative Commons License Cabrillo National Monument 2012 Visitation: 878,000; 78th most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $56 million It's the centennial year for this San Diego park and cuts will likely affect celebration plans, in addition to scaled back educational programs and natural resource work. "We collect scientific data to track the health of our plants, terrestrial wildlife, as well as our marine wildlife, and it won't be possible to maintain our collection efforts in all areas," according to a statement provided by the park. The historic lighthouse and the 308 stairs down to it. | Photo: Joe Azure/Flickr/ Creative Commons License Point Reyes National Seashore 2012 Visitation: 2.4 million; 35th most visited unit in the system 2011 Visitor Spending: $93.3 million Travelers will mostly notice the partial or full closure of this park's three visitor centers. The heavily-visited Bear Valley center will probably see a one-day-a-week closure while the Lighthouse Visitor Center will close an additional day a week (it currently closes on Tuesdays and Wednesdays). The Kenneth C. Patrick Visitor Center may close entirely. Possible additional effects include reducing custodial services and threatened and invasive species monitoring. And at least five positions will remain vacant.

@KCET KCET28 Youtube Schedule About Newsletters KCET Donate Shows News Arts Living SoCal Video Support SoCal Wanderer Living > Travel > SoCal Wanderer > National Parks > Sequester May Mean Huge Cuts For California's National Parks National Parks Sequester May Mean Huge Cuts For California's National Parks by Chris Clarke February 20, 2013 2:35 PM Share this article Tweet Tioga Road may stay closed a lot later this year due to budget stalemating | Photo: Jude Robinson/Flickr/ Creative Commons License If Beltway Insiders' talk of the sequester has made your eyes glaze over so far, here's something that may make you open those eyes wide: This postponed and renamed Son of The Fiscal Cliff, which goes into effect March 1 if no action is taken to prevent it, may mean at least $7 million in cuts to California's National Parks, Monuments, Recreation Areas, and Historic Sites. That could mean no seasonal ranger hires, closed campgrounds, and limited visitor center hours. It could also mean you have to drive a few extra hours to get to the other side of the Sierra Nevada until the snow melts: the cuts would mean no budget for Yosemite National Park to plow Route 120 over Tioga Pass. Story Continues Below Support KCET According to data provided to KCET by the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, $110 million in total nationwide cuts to the National Park Service budget would be required under the terms of the "sequester," Beltway jargon for the across-the-board cuts in discretionary spending that Congress agreed to postpone until March 1 in the absence of an agreement to avert the so-called "fiscal cliff." Of that $110 million in cuts, about $7.6 million would be taken from the budgets of the 26 National Park units in California. These cuts would range from more than $1.4 million carved out of Yosemite National Park's 2013 budget, to a $9,000 reduction in the budget of the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial in Concord, whose budget is already tight enough that the memorial is open by reservation only. By default, this chart lists sequester cuts in ascending order. Click on headings to toggle each column by its value. One factor that makes the cuts all the more drastic: the NPS's Fiscal Year 2013 started in October 2012, meaning the parks have already spent almost a quarter of their budget for FY13. In order to make cuts of 5 percent for the whole fiscal year, cuts in month-to-month budgets will have to be closer to 7 percent from March through October 2013. The National Park Service is being tight-lipped about these cuts' likely effects on the ground. Park Service spokesperson Jeffrey Olson did offer a statement to KCET, saying in part: The public should be prepared for reduced hours and services provided by National Park Service employees at 398 national parks, historic sites, monuments and memorials, parkways, trails, preserves and reserves, seashores and lakeshores, recreation areas and national battlefields. Visitors would see reduced hours of operation for visitor centers, shorter seasons, and possibly closing of camping, hiking and other recreational areas when there is insufficient staff to ensure the protection of visitors, employees, and historic, cultural and natural resources. The reductions would limit the National Park Service's ability to sustain a full complement of seasonal employees needed for interpretive programs, maintenance, law enforcement and other visitor services as we are preparing for the busy summer season. The Coalition of National Park Service Retirees is suggesting more specific scenarios, including a possible month-long delay in opening the Tioga and Glacier Point roads in Yosemite National Park this spring to save money on plowing. The Coalition also made public a January 25 memo from National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis to NPS Regional, Associate and Assistant Directors in which Jarvis says to delay hiring for permanent and seasonal positions and examine the budget impacts of furloughing staff. Jarvis also directed his troops to assess the economic impact of possible reduced services and hours on gateway communities. That impact may be considerable. According to a report released Wednesday by the Outdoor Industry Association, Outdoor Recreation generates $85.4 billion in consumer spending in California, which in turn generates $6.7 billion in state and local tax revenue. 732,000 Californians work in jobs created directly by outdoor recreation. Though there are plenty of places to play outdoors in California not managed by the National Park Service, it's hard to deny that the state's National Park Service holdings, from Yosemite to Joshua Tree to Redwood to the Santa Monica Mountains, generate a huge amount of tourism from out of state. Local communities rely on "multiplier effects" of dollars spent by National Park visitors. Cutting back on that multiplier could mean serious hardship for those communities.
