Print E-mail SHARE February 3, 2011 Gallup Finds U.S. Unemployment Up Slightly in January to 9.8% Underemployment at 18.9%, compared with 19.0% at the end of December by Dennis Jacobe, Chief Economist PRINCETON, NJ -- Unemployment, as measured by Gallup without seasonal adjustment, increased to 9.8% at the end of January -- up from 9.6% at the end of December, but down from 10.9% a year ago. The percentage of part-time workers who want full-time work improved slightly, to 9.1% of the workforce in January from 9.4% in December -- similar to the 9.0% of January 2010. Underemployment Essentially Unchanged in January Underemployment -- the combination of part-time workers wanting full-time work and Gallup's U.S. unemployment rate -- was 18.9% in January, essentially the same as the 19.0% of December. Underemployment now stands one percentage point below the 19.9% of a year ago. The Real-Time Jobs Picture See global employment data > Comparing Gallup's unemployment and underemployment rates so far in 2011 with those for the same periods in 2010 provides something of a seasonally adjusted view of Gallup's jobs data. Unemployment and underemployment are now at least one point below the rates of a year ago, reflecting modest improvement over the past year. Still, Gallup's measures paint a real-time picture of the current job realities on the ground: nearly 1 in 10 Americans in the U.S. workforce are unemployed, nearly one out of five are underemployed, and the nation's overall hiring situation has not improved over the past four to six months. Gallup.com reports results from these indexes in daily, weekly, and monthly averages and in Gallup.com stories.

View our economic release schedule. Survey Methods Gallup's U.S. employment measures report the percentage of U.S. adults in the workforce, aged 18 and older, who are underemployed and unemployed, without seasonal adjustment. "Underemployed" respondents are employed part time, but want to work full time, or they are unemployed. Results for each 30-day rolling average are based on telephone interviews with approximately 30,000 adults. Because results are not seasonally adjusted, they are not directly comparable to numbers reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which are based on workers aged 16 and older. Results are based on telephone interviews conducted as part of Gallup Daily tracking Jan. 2-31, 2011, with a random sample of 18,213 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, selected using random-digit-dial sampling. For results based on the total sample of national adults, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±0.7 percentage points. Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones and cellular phones, with interviews conducted in Spanish for respondents who are primarily Spanish-speaking. Each daily sample includes a minimum quota of 200 cell phone respondents and 800 landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas among landline respondents for gender within region. Landline respondents are chosen at random within each household on the basis of which member had the most recent birthday. Samples are weighted by gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, adults in the household, cell phone-only status, cell phone-mostly status, and phone lines. Demographic weighting targets are based on the March 2010 Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older non-institutionalized population living in U.S. telephone households. All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting and sample design. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.

Recent Posts A Romney Presidency Could Finally Bring Back Balance Between... Serious Budget, Debt Ceiling and Fiscal Reform?... It Takes A Crisis Beating Wall Street: A Scorecard Of Our “20 Investment Themes For... Wow!...Canada's economy added twice as many more jobs in January than here in the US! 69,200 versus 36,000 respectively. Granted this is only one months data but it is quite a feat symbolically considering Canada's economy is only one tenth the size of the US. And their unemployment rate remains significantly below that of the US...7.6% vs 9% here....and the strong loonie, one of the best bellweathers of their booming economy,  continues to flirt with parity to the US $. Consistently throughout the economic crisis, the Canadian economy has outperformed the US. In fact the more policy proactive and responsible Bank of Canada has been removing "crisis monetary policy", getting ahead of the inflation curve and raising rates over the past year...three times.....no need for ZIRP and no QE 1 and 2....The Bernank take note! So what's going on up there in the Great White North that allows them to kick US economic butt and claim that the 21st century belongs to them?...Is it something in the water...Or the beer? How has their much vaunted cultural mosaic and laid back, conservative national character allowed them to morph into an economic dynamo? It can't be their sacred cow (for the time being) single pay, aka "get into the que" health care system! Bilingualism? Doubt it,  although I do believe the history of the English/French cultural dichotomy does positively contribute to their diverse national identity and shows how a rising economic tide lifts all boats. But that's a story for another day.  How about their continued constitutional ties to the dysfunctional British Monarchy? Not! Or how about... Latent Hockey Puck Syndrome? its an aggressive sport. No...there's still the lingering and deflating emotional curse of the Maple Leafs! The popular opinion today credits Canada's superior banking system with its'  stability and conservative culture that allowed them to dodge the real estate bullet with their stricter lending standards. Avoiding the housing bubble allowed the Canadian government to effectively direct stimulus funds into job creating infrastructure projects while the US government has been forced to divert trillions of borrowed dollars into bailing out poorly managed and over extended financial institutions. Lower Canadian corporate tax rates also add to the positive growth mix. OK...these are all important contributing factors. But they are not THE reason why Canada is emerging as a new economic global force. No...for that we have to return to Canada in the early 1990's when a new conservative fiscal foundation was laid. And on this point I hope US policy makers are paying attention. Canada in 1993, like the US now, was facing a fiscal crisis of serious proportions... there were fears of  debt default, concerns about failures of Provincial debt auctions and credit ratings downgrades. The talk of IMF intervention was real as the Loonie was renamed the Canadian Peso. Government combined public debt had reached 53% of GDP in 1992 as the national debt had doubled from the early 1960's. Government spending as a percentage of GDP had expanded to 23% from 15%...unemployment was rising. Canada was on the brink of a fiscal crisis. Does all of this sound familiar? US government spending is approaching 25% of GDP and by recent estimates debt has breached 100% of it...we have  municipal and state default risk rising and threats of a downgrade of federal debt. The debt ceiling which has more than doubled in the past few years...will have to be raised again in the Spring. The economy is languishing as the weak employment report showed today. Stagflation risk is rising. Experts say that if current government spending and fiscal trends continue they will lead to Club Med like debt levels and potential default within the next few years. So what did Canadian policy makers do to get themselves out of their debt hole in the early 90's? Did they announce more deficit funded stimulus spending on bullet trains, solar cells and the like? No! Did they take a politically charged and partisan, "my way or the highway" approach to handling their countries fiscal crisis? No.  Did they refrain from asking for a shared public sacrifice as they moved toward austerity? No. The Canadian Liberal government took a more fiscally proactive and common sense approach and in a uniquely bipartisan way (funny what you can accomplish when it hits the fan), they focused on deep spending cuts. They cut in  areas of social and defense spending including regional development, transportation and industry and they restricted transfer payments to provinces which forced the provincial governments to get on board and become more fiscally responsible. They also bit the bullet and cut the civil service workforce. And finally they had the courage to touch the third entitlement rail of politics and took steps to put the Canada Pension Plan on to a firmer fiscal foundation. And the results? Well there was pain of course but it was a shared austerity across the country. And the fiscal improvement was tangible and happened quickly. In the next two years debt shrank and so did interest payments as government spending declined by almost 9% and the debt levels went down across the board.  The deep spending cuts led to balanced budgets from 2000 to 2008 when the latest crisis hit. Canada was not exempted from the recession but it weathered it much better as the current government had greater flexibility to maneuver and wasn't constrained by a banking crisis. Now all of the jobs lost  have been replaced and the Conservative Government has targeted 2015 for a balanced budget...unfortunately here in the US we are far  from meeting those benchmarks. So here we are. Canada's politicians have provided a play book and a real time game plan with concrete results for US policy makers to help them get out from under the debt overhang that has accumulated in the past few years.  Will America's policy makers swallow their partisanship and tear a few pages from the Canadians play book? I know the Canucks, as the US 's largest trading partner, are hoping they do.  Or will it take an actual debt crisis to get them to move? If the tone of the recent SOTU and subsequent ongoing policy sclerosis and enhanced government spendathon is any indication, I am not optimistic. One thing we do know, to paraphrase the famous South Park Canadian parody song...if the US policy makers fail to get their fiscal house in order...we can't "Blame Canada"...but they can blame us for the potential catastrophic  global consequences of the their failure to act.

Economists had expected at least 146,000 new jobs last month, so the numbers reported Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor painted a mixed picture of the economy, which has struggled for more than two years. Snow and ice storms in many parts of the country likely cut employment in construction and other industries, the labor department said. The Labor Department's household survey determined that more than a half-million people without jobs found work. But there are still 13.9 million people who are unemployed. Unemployment Drops Because Americans Just Give Up Kelley Briggs, 50, from Cumberland, R.I., was laid off in the same week more than two years ago as her husband. Both have since been in and out of jobs, and she had a 19-month period with no employment. "It was frightening in that we didn't know how the future was going to go financially. It was frustrating because no matter how many times we applied for things, we didn't get anything. I couldn't even get interviews," she told ABC News. "I just think there was so many people looking. I don't think it was my age, but nobody will ever say that because of legal implications." The labor department said harsh snowstorms last month cut into construction employment, which fell by 32,000, the most since May. A 45,000 drop in messengers and couriers cut that industry's employment by 8 percent. In one bright spot, manufacturing added 49,000 jobs, the most since August 1998. Some economists had expected unemployment to rise from December's 9.4 percent, making the surprise drop another bit of good news. Richard Fuka, 50, has owned his own fishing business in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, since 1987. His boat has been idle for most of the past four years because of federal limits on each state's total allowable catch of fish. "I would describe my business as the heart and soul of my entire life. I have had the spirit of wanting to be a fisherman since wanting to be a child.…I am so in love with my business it is beyond comprehension. It's my heart and soul and my family's life." Fuka has managed to find other sources of income related to the fishing industry through entrepreneurship: "I've taken the skills I've learned since I was a little boy. I've tried to get into the boat repair business to try to sustain myself while I wait for the president to answer our call for help so I can go fishing." He has two sons in high school 13 and 16: "It has been very difficult for them, but at the same time, our household has chosen to take a proactive approach to look not at the glass half empty but glass half full. Because parents want to give everything to their children, in a painful way, they have reinvented themselves to make do. "We have electricity and heat in the house but we keep it very simple. There have been times we have had electricity turned off, but you have to readjust and earn money to have these things," he said.

The establishment survey showed a gain of just 36,000 jobs in January, following a revised gain of 121,000 jobs in December.  The big gainers in January were white men, who saw their unemployment rate fall by 0.6 percentage points for the second consecutive month; although at 7.9 percent it is still somewhat higher than the 7.0 percent rate for white women, which is a decrease of 0.3 percentage points since December. The unemployment rate for Hispanics also fell by 0.6 percentage points to 11.9 percent. The latest data from the employment-to-population ratio for men is still 7.7 percentage points below its peak in 2000, while the EPOP for women is down by 3.6 percentage points.  There was little change in the employment situation of blacks. Their overall unemployment rate of 15.7 percent remains near the peak for the downturn, as does the 45.4 percent unemployment rate for black teens.     By educational attainment, the biggest gainers were college graduates who saw a 0.6 percentage-point drop in their unemployment rate to 4.2 percent. The unemployment rate for college grads has fallen from 5.1 percent to 4.2 percent in two months, a decline of 17.6 percent. The unemployment rate for people without high school degrees fell by 1.1 percent in January, but this was associated with a 0.3 percentage point drop in their EPOP.   There were also 524,000 people involuntarily working part-time. This figure is down by 1.1 million from its September level.   Month-to-month comparisons are made difficult by the change in the population controls in the household survey. With the change in controls, employment rose by 117,000; however, the gain would have been 589,000 had it not been for the change. While this is a large difference with the 36,000 job gain shown in the establishment data, such discrepancies are not uncommon, especially in the month of January.   In January of 1992, 1994, and 1997, the household survey showed gains in employment (not counting any population control effects) of 512,000, 502,000, and 438,000, respectively. These gains exceeded the gains reported in the establishment survey by 463,000, 234,000, and 235,000, respectively. In January of 2000, the employment gain (adjusted for the change in controls) was 784,000, or 535,000 more than the gain shown by the establishment survey.   The numbers in the surveys tend to converge over time. The household survey had been showing slower employment growth than the establishment survey. The increase in employment since January 2010, adjusted for the change in controls, is 1,284,000. This compares to a gain of 984,000 jobs in the establishment survey.     The picture in the establishment survey is mostly quite bleak. The average rate of job creation over the last three months has been just 87,000, a rate that is not enough fast enough to keep pace with the growth of the labor force. Furthermore, there is no sector showing especially strong growth.   Retail added 27,500 jobs, but this followed two months where it had lost 12,800. Healthcare added just 10,600 jobs, less than half its average over the last year. Restaurants reduced employment by 4,400 in January. State and local government reduced employment by 12,000, and construction employment fell by another 32,000. Finance lost 10,000 jobs. There was an anomalous loss of 44,8000 courier jobs, but this reversed a jump of roughly the same size in December. The one notable bright spot was manufacturing, which added 49,000 jobs, which seem to be centered on the auto industry.   There is little evidence that employers are about to pick up the pace of hiring. Jobs in the temp sector increased by just 13,200 after rising at an average rate of 31,500 in the prior three months. Average weekly hours actually fell slightly from 34.3 to 34.2 hours. And wage growth remains very weak with the average hour wage increasing at just 1.54 percent annual rate over the last quarter, down from a 1.96 percent rate over the last year.

The Unemployment rate dropped to 9 percent, the lowest since April 2009. Feb. 4, 2011 | 4:42 p.m. EST + More Today the Bureau of Labor and Statistics announced January’s unemployment rate was 9 percent—the lowest level since April 2009 and .4 percentage points less than December. But the report says the country gained only 36,000 non-farm jobs, far less than the roughly 145,000 new jobs some economists predicted for last month—likely the effect of winter weather,  analysts say. Snow days also may have distorted the payroll count. The fact that “886,000 workers could not show up for work the week the survey was taken because of inclement weather means we had an undercount pretty severely,” economist Diane Swonk told the Chicago Sun-Times. “At least a portion of those...had new jobs.” It's possible for the two job indicators to be so different partly because the data comes from two different surveys: Unemployment is calculated from the household survey while job creation data comes from a survey of businesses and government agencies. The numbers are confusing, but some economists say this is a sign of hope. “The household survey has a history of leading payrolls in a recovery, so we’re setting ourselves up for a pretty strong improvement in payrolls,” economist Stephen Stanley told Bloomberg. “The numbers that look weak on the surface now will turn more robust by the March-April-May period.” Skeptics say the unemployment rate drop is less about economic improvement and more about potential workers giving up. National Review Online’s Douglas Holtz-Eakin blames the president. “The cumulative decline of nearly half a million in the labor force since the recession began remains the most fundamental indictment of the economic-policy regime under President Obama.” What do you think? Is the employment climate on track to improve? Take the poll and post your thoughts below. This poll is now closed, but the debate continues in the comments section.
