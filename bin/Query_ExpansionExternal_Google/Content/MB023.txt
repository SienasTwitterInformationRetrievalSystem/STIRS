Airlines have canceled more than 2,200 flights at O’Hare and at least 400 flights at Midway. Thursday’s cancellations and delays will be announced later Thursday morning. Southwest Airlines has suspended all operations at Midway through at least 6:30 a.m. Thursday, according to the Southwest website. The resumption of Southwest’s service at Midway is contingent upon the conditions of the runways, taxiways, other airport services, and the city’s infrastructure to and from the airport, the airline said. Travelers who had originally scheduled flights from, to, or connecting through Chicago’s airports Wednesday or Thursday are strongly encouraged to check their airline’s website or call them to confirm the status of their flight. -- METRA Metra trains are running on all lines Thursday, but the four following lines will run on modified schedules, their website said. • Union Pacific/Northwest Line • Union Pacific/North Line • Union Pacific/West Line • Milwaukee District/North Line -- PACE Pace will operate feeder route service to and from Metra Stations Thursday, according to its website. However, the transit agency cautioned that buses may not be able to travel regular routes if road conditions are poor. Buses will operate using a regular schedule even though some Metra lines are running on a modified schedule, the website said. Riders should be patient and avoid exposure to extreme cold as they wait for buses, the website said. -- CTA The CTA said bus and train ridership was lighter than normal Wednesday, according to a 4:30 p.m. update on the CTA’s website. If people absolutely have to travel, the CTA says rail service is currently the best alternative. As of early Thursday, all eight of the CTA’s rail lines are operating normally. Trains on the Pink Line between the Pulaski and 54th/Cermak stations on the West Side began normal operations early Thursday. Service on the Yellow Line, which operates between Howard Street and Skokie, was also restored early Thursday. Dozens of bus routes remain re-routed, mostly because of the lingering closure of Lake Shore Drive, the website said. Bus service was expected to “remain challenging” until the streets are cleared, CTA President Richard Rodriguez said Wednesday morning. -- AMTRAK Amtrak plans to restore most corridor services in the Chicago Hub on Thursday, February 3, following this week’s blizzard conditions, according to a notification on Amtrak’s website. All Hiawatha Service trains to and from Chicago and Milwaukee, all Wolverine Service, Blue Water and Pere Marquette trains to and from Michigan and three of the five round-trips on the Chicago-St. Louis corridor are scheduled to operate, subject to residual weather-related delays. For Chicago Hub Amtrak trains originating Thursday, the following are canceled: • Chicago-St. Louis Lincoln Service: Trains 300 and 301, 304 and 305. • Chicago-Carbondale Illini and Saluki: Trains 390 & 391 only • Chicago-Quincy Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg: All trains canceled. For Chicago Hub trains originating Thursday, Chicago-Quincy Illinois Zephyr & Carl Sandburg trains are all canceled, as well. Other Amtrak services that serve Chicago, such as the Southwest Chief, the California Zephyr, and the Empire Builder and the New York Cardinal have also been affected and may have some trains canceled or delayed Thursday. Affected Amtrak passengers with telephone information in their reservations are being notified, and anyone traveling in the Midwest should check the status of their train before leaving home.

Trust your eye and you should be fine. And it's a fun way to spend a fairly long service stop, a lot easier than the mad dash to the store in the station and junk shop across the street in Grand Junction, CO on the California Zephyr. I'd like to see some food vendors, though. #3 A.J. A.J. Lead Service Attendant Members 195 posts Gender:Female Posted 06 February 2011 - 11:50 PM I purchased several items during the Albuquerque stop and was very pleased with all of them. You should have plenty of time to look around and compare prices if need be. I bought a small pendant for myself and have worn it nearly every day since and at less than $20 it was a bargain. also, the sellers are very friendly and you might enjoy chatting with them. have a great trip!

I got a beautiful pendant on a black strand of beads that I wear fairly often and it has held up very well. My sister got a beautiful hand hammered metal cuff bracelet.

Wife is somewhat of an expert in native American jewelry and art and a geology major and knows what is good and what is not. There are two or three of the dealers mostly selling tourist grade items but one lady with a large set of tables had some very nice items each time we stopped and sometimes priced within reason. Its is alway fun to see what is there especially if there is a long layover. Once got into ABQ an hour early and had lots of time to explore the station and surrounding territory before reboarding.

Yeah, the Native Americans sell pretty decent stuff out on the platform there. I ended up getting a couple of Route 66 New Mexico/Arizona post cards to mail back home... got 2 blankets that were pretty nice... and 2 pieces of pottery. The blankets were warm and toasty and remind me of my trip on the Southwest Chief whenever I use them at night... and whenever I see the pottery in my living room it reminds me of the trip. I dont know if I would have bought something if I wasn't into sentimental things... but my condo is decorated in Amtrak posters and memorablila and other stuff from my trips. I try and pick up something small from all my train trips. I think the most "interesting" souviner I got was from the stop on #421 in El Paso, TX in 2007. We were about 45 minutes EARLY into El Paso... meaning we'd be there for almost 2 hours. I saw on the GPS that the Mexican border was 6 blocks from the station... so yes... I walked over there and bought a blanket and a few other trinkets... and made it back to the train with 25 minutes to spare. With the way Juarez has got increasingly dangerous I don't think I'd do it again though. Edited by rtabern, 07 February 2011 - 02:23 AM.

Her own work is arranged separately from the mass-market stuff on her tables. It is signed on the back by her; unsigned items in any of the vendor stands are generally mass-market. You can ask her to show you some of her pieces in your price range. Some vendors sell non-jewelry items (rugs, etc.) but I don't know about that stuff.

There was a shop with silver/turquoise jewelry. Naturally, who goes in , my wife. The proprietor was actually quite learned on all things turquoise. I learned a lot from him, and became a believer in my wife's eye for quality. A bracelet that my wife purchased for $60.00 on the platform was easily worth $200.00 retail. He was very impressed with the workmanship. We have made several passes through ABQ and always have made a purchase from either one of them. We will be on the ABQ platform July 5th of this year and are currently budgeting accordingly.

Posted 08 February 2011 - 10:57 AM The Empire Builder has been running quite late both east and west for almost a week now. Some portions have even cancelled. How long might this continue? Why is it happening? What are the chances of an on-time (or at least not 7 hours late) trip on Friday, Feb. 11? It's winter on the Hi Line, and given the combination of bad weather, an upsurge in freight traffic, and few unfortunate incidents (that recent bomb scare, for instance) the Empire Builder is not running on time. Remember that since the train is turned around in Seattle (and Portland), if the westbound #7 is significantly late, the eastbound #8 can't possibly leave on time. In either direction, small problems can cause big delays just because it's so hard to work outside when wind chills head below -40. I'd expect your eastbound train to be late. The westbound train has a better chance of being on time, since it's just starting its journey. Now, if we had a train on the route St. Paul-Chicago, you'd have much better chance for on-time travel. The chances for such a train, though, seem slim. In today's Minneapolis paper there's a depressing article. Edited by Ispolkom, 08 February 2011 - 10:58 AM.

Some portions have even cancelled. How long might this continue? Why is it happening? What are the chances of an on-time (or at least not 7 hours late) trip on Friday, Feb. 11? Really late EB running in the winter usually correlates with major snowstorms or temperatures below -10 on the northern plains (as is the case now). Temps are forecast to warm up by Thursday, so I'll be optimistic and say there is a >50% chance that your eastbound #8 will be less than four hours late.

This IS EB related as we sat in CUS for over an hour waiting for yesterday's arrival of a very late EB. I completed my entire dinner in the confines of the cave. Not Empire Builder related. 20 minutes outside of Chicago we lost the lead engine and sat for over another hour. (very funny story with this, but maybe another time) We are now east of Pittsburgh (just) and sitting again. We lost our slot and the freights are having their way with us! Just need to make the #19 Crescent connection in WAS at 6:30 PM Looking to arrive between 4 and 5 this afternoon, barring any more delays.

I sure hope it's not like that this summer! I think that it's winter on the Hi Line. Probably the upswing in freight on the northern Transcon doesn't help once the Empire Builder is delayed.

Looks like they have one track back in service now. From BNSF website: 02/21/2011 Preliminary Report: Derailment in Williston, North Dakota BNSF has a report that train G ABATAC9 19 has derailed in Williston, North Dakota at approximately 2:56 a.m. CT on Monday, February 21, 2011. This location is approximately 324 miles northeast of Billings, Montana. BNSF personnel are on the scene to investigate the derailment damages. At this time, both main tracks are out of service with no estimated time of opening. BNSF may re-route some traffic in order to minimize impact to service and will continue to provide customers with additional information as it becomes available. Customers may experience delays of 48-72 hours on shipments moving through this corridor. Updated shipment information is always available through the Rail Central tool in the secure bnsf.com. If you have any questions, please contact BNSF Customer Support at 1-888-428- 2673, option 4, option 3. 02/22/2011 Update Report: Derailment in Williston, North Dakota In a Service Advisory issued on February 21, 2011, BNSF reported that train G ABATAC9 19 derailed in Williston, North Dakota. Main track two was restored to service at 8:45 a.m. CT on February 22, 2011. The current estimate for main track one to return to service is at 9:00 p.m. CT on February 22, 2011. Due to the congestion resulted from this service interruption, customers should plan for an additional 24 to 36 hours of transit time on shipments moving through this corridor.

A bus bridge was established yesterday (February 21) between Minot and Havre to get Amtrak passengers around the derailment site.

Back to top Quote MultiQuote #19 anir dendroica anir dendroica Conductor Members 504 posts Posted 22 February 2011 - 04:09 PM There are 22 hours between scheduled arrival in Chicago (as #8) and scheduled departure the next day as #7. I imagine at least six hours are required for pre-departure servicing, so Amtrak might consider turning the train in MSP if it is over 16 hours late. This has happened occasionally for trains running about 24 hours behind due to derailments/major breakdowns, but it doesn't occur more than once or twice a year. If weather conditions are sufficiently bad, Amtrak will run the very late train to Chicago and cancel the next day's departure. Amtrak sometimes offers bustitution to Chicago for passengers with a connecting train; I don't know what the window of lateness is for this, but I would guess 2-6 hours behind schedule (< 2, train will probably make connections, > 6, bus would arrive too late). In these cases, pax with a final destination of Chicago or between MSP and Chicago will have an option to stay on the train. If the train is later than 5-6 hours behind schedule, they may still run a bus MSP-Chicago on time, but passengers boarding prior to MSP are out of luck in terms of Chicago connections.

As for weather delays as far I know there were none. Likewise, when I took the Empire Builder from Grand Forks to Portland in December of last year, we arrived in PDX only 15 minutes late. You can't really draw any conclusions, good or bad, on the basis of one trip. (Another difference btw the VIA route and the EB is that the VIA route runs only 3x a week. I'm sure the EB performance would be dramatically increased if they dropped 4 departures a week, but I highly doubt anyone here would like that.) 1 2 3 Next » Back to Amtrak Rail Discussion Reply to this topic \n Hello World\n \n \n Test \n \n HTML mode is enabled.    0 user(s) are reading this topic 0 members, 0 guests, 0 anonymous users Reply to quoted posts      Clear     Amtrak Unlimited Discussion Forum → Amtrak Rail Discussions → Amtrak Rail Discussion Privacy Policy Change Theme IP.Board IP.Board Mobile Help Community Forum Software by IP.Board Licensed to: AmtrakTrains.com Sign In Need an account?

STORY HIGHLIGHTS A low-speed derailment occurs just east of Penn Station, Amtrak says No injuries are reported; Amtrak arranges for the passengers to be put on other trains RELATED TOPICS Amtrak Penn Station New York City Boston Rail Accidents New York (CNN) -- A Boston-bound Amtrak train derailed Monday afternoon just east of New York City's Penn Station, the rail service said. No injuries were reported among the approximately 147 passengers and an unspecified number of crew members, Amtrak said in a news release. It called the accident, which occurred at 12:25 p.m., a "low-speed derailment." The passengers were taken back to Penn Station in Manhattan, where arrangements were made to "provide them travel on another train," Amtrak said. The line also is used by the Long Island Railroad. But Amtrak said the East River tunnels, which take trains from Manhattan to Long Island, "are not blocked and Amtrak and Long Island Railroad trains are operating through the area with minimal delays."
