Dana Edelson/NBCU Photobank via AP Images In a surprise news posting on Jack White's Third Man Records website, The White Stripes officially announced that they have broken up. "The reason is not due to artistic differences or lack of wanting to continue," the post reads. "Nor any health issues as both Meg and Jack are feeling fine and in good health. It is for a myriad of reasons, but mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way." Photos: The White Stripes: Under the Great White Northern Lights The post continues: "Both Meg and Jack hope this decision isn't met with sorrow by their fans but that it is seen as a positive move done out of respect for the music that the band has created. It is also done with the utmost respect to those fans who've shared in those creations, with their feelings considered greatly." Photos: The White Stripes Shot on Tour for Ewen Spencer's Book 'Three's a Crowd' The White Stripes last toured behind their 2007 disc Icky Thump, but it was cut short when drummer Meg White began suffering from acute anxiety problems. Since then the group performed "We're Going To Be Friends" on the final episode of Late Night With Conan O'Brien on February 20th, 2009. Just a few months ago White told Vanity Fair that he hoped to get back into the studio with Meg soon and "start fresh." The White Stripes Preview A Clip From Under Great White Northern Lights Since The White Stripes began their hiatus in 2008 White has kept extremely busy with his other bands The Raconteurs and The Dead Weather, as well as producing Wanda Jackson's new record. Meg White has kept a far lower profile.  In 2009 she married guitarist Jackson Smith, the son of Patti Smith and the late Fred "Sonic" Smith of the MC5. "The White Stripes do not belong to Meg and Jack anymore," the band wrote at the end of their statement. "The White Stripes belong to you now and you can do with it whatever you want. The beauty of art and music is that it can last forever if people want it to. Thank you for sharing this experience. Your involvement will never be lost on us and we are truly grateful."

Springsteen told Rolling Stone the alienation the man feels is a metaphor for life in a politically altered post-9/11 America. “Who would have ever thought we’d live in a country without habeas corpus?” he said. “That’s Orwellian. That’s what political hysteria is about and how effective it is. I felt it in myself. You get frightened for your family, for your home. And you realize how countries can move way off course, very far from democratic ideals.” More Song Stories entries » Twitter   Channels Music Movies Politics Artists Photos Videos RS Country Follow Us   Facebook   Twitter   Google+   YouTube   Pinterest   Tumblr Subscribe Subscribe Give A Gift Back Issues Customer Service RS Archive Digital Access Additional Advertise Contact Privacy Policy Your Privacy Rights Your Ad Choices Data Policy Terms of Use Sitemap Careers Affiliates RS Fine Art Cover Series RS Wine Club RS Sheet Music Books Wenner Media Websites: Rolling Stone| Us Weekly| Men's Journal| Jann S.

At least we still got Dead Weather :/ Posted by Lane | February 2, 2011 1:14 PM yall are retarded, white stripes are badass shit. they piss on your dreamwave fuzzy buzzy reverb-core flavor of the month Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:14 PM They didn't break up - they retired the band - BIG difference! Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:16 PM NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:16 PM Does this mean they can both start using their real last names now? Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:20 PM But what about Griiiiizly Bearrrrrrrrrr? Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:20 PM Meg's real last name was actually White! Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:20 PM all the negative posters here truly are exceptional ASSHOLES. they know NOTHING of music or PASSION or ending something before it turns bad (the Jam had the good sense to do it, the Simpsons have not). the white stripes made some amazing music in their time together and it will last FAR longer than the infantile comments posted here by hipster LOSERS. and a side note to the meg-haters: she may not have been technically proficient to all you drummer-wannabes, but she has more soul than any of you. envy sure rears its ugly head in many ways. thanks White Stripes - it's been an exciting ride! Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:21 PM This is rubbish... The real reason for the breakup is jack white is dedicating his time to opening up a hummus shop down on Bedford. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:21 PM this is so sad Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:22 PM Wow! Now I know what it must have felt like to hear that the Beatles broke up. This is heartbreaking and music will never be the same. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:23 PM Wow, this is a huge bummer. Fuck. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:24 PM What will frat boys listen to to feel cool now? Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:25 PM they were fun to see live. i'd have liked one more tour! too bad. ava shalom. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:27 PM Glad I saw them a few times. Best ever was opening for the Strokes @ Radio City. A second best was @ Coney Island with M. Ward/Shins... Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:27 PM Confidential to Jack & Meg: You can't really sign the letter as being from "The White Stripes" if it no longer exists. Posted by AG | February 2, 2011 1:28 PM The White Stripes were Jack at his best. Meg was his muse setting the noise canvas with her drumsticks for his guitar to tear riffs on. This sucks, especially since there have been so many recent reports about a new album in the works. But Jack is a busy bee and he'll be on to the next project before you know it. RIP Stripes, and here's to the reunion. Posted by Mike | February 2, 2011 1:29 PM tits up Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:29 PM The White Stripes were nothing but a four chord gimmick. Meg's drumming was displorable, Jack was a young Mick Jagger meets Chuck Barry harlot. I give them credit for De Stijl, but everything after that was pure garbage. I hated Elephant as it was a Jam knockoff. To all the so-called rock purists on here crying and telling us who think this announcement was long overdue to shut up, I say you shut up. Your band is dead and gone and all of their dumb words about their music living on is meaningless because by next week, some new Best Coast type band will have kids' attention deficit listening disorder hooked and they won't even know what a Meg White is. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:29 PM hm so is this the end of Meg's music career? :( Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:30 PM breaking up these days is nothing more than a ploy to sell more records, and to hype up a reunion tour 5-10 years from now. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:31 PM displorable? Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:32 PM hey 1:29, you weird hater, everyone here finds you "displorable." Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:32 PM they see me trollin', they hatin' Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:32 PM 1:29 = sarah palin Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:33 PM "good. maybe jack can perform white stripes songs with a real drummer now." Amen! Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:33 PM 1:29 It must suck to have such a joyless existence. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:33 PM Displorable is more real of a word than the White Stripes are a band. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:34 PM Now, if radiohead, arcade fire & U2 would follow suit it would make for a wonderful day. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:35 PM thanks a lot Meg boooooo Posted by Kyle | February 2, 2011 1:35 PM I saw the white stripes a long time ago. I thought they were really good live... Big full sound for a two piece. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:35 PM hoteeeeeeeel yyooooorbaaaaaaaaaaaaa Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:37 PM So..... Will Jack White make another 1) Raconteurs 2) The Dead Weather 3) start another band What do you guys think? P.S. I can't believe this just happened... Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:37 PM That sex tape really did her in. They were pretty much over after that whole debacle. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:37 PM 1:29 I never understand why people would spend the time to post something about a band that they do not enjoy. Is it to make them feel better about their own inadequacies? Spelling for instance? Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:38 PM like them or not, they changed music. sorry to hear they're done. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:39 PM i'll always remember exactly where i was when i heard this news. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:41 PM We can do what we want with the Stripes...sweet I am taking them on tour! Caching!!!!! Wow Meg must have had some breakdown. Its too bad they didn't complete the 50 state tour... Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:42 PM Jack, You aren't special. Love, __________ Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:43 PM "all the negative posters here truly are exceptional ASSHOLES." Translation: They're saying what everyone else has been thinking for years. "they know NOTHING of music or PASSION or ending something before it turns bad (the Jam had the good sense to do it, the Simpsons have not)." Translation: I have no concept of what it means to evolve artistically and I equate empty-headed windbags of emotion with sincerity of feeling. "the white stripes made some amazing music in their time together and it will last FAR longer than the infantile comments posted here by hipster LOSERS." Translation: "I have no outlet for my artistic aspirations and have set the bar so low that sewer rats and the White Stripes occupy the same level of aesthetics." "and a side note to the meg-haters: she may not have been technically proficient to all you drummer-wannabes, but she has more soul than any of you." Translation: "She's horrible, and you pointed it out, so you're horrible, too." "envy sure rears its ugly head in many ways." Translation: "I myself am envious, so I project that envy onto everyone else." "thanks White Stripes - it's been an exciting ride!" Translation: "Sell-outs!" Posted by Crosseyed Sniper | February 2, 2011 1:43 PM I'll tell you why I wrote it: Because people need a strong dose of tough love in these instances. Your love for the band is just so blatantly displorable and blind to the fact that they aren't very good. They are a weak two piece band who built their careers off color coordination and the mystery of were they or werent they married. Want a real band? Try Mumford and Sons. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:44 PM Crosseyed Sniper - tranlation: douchebag. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:46 PM (the Jam had the good sense to do it, the Simpsons have not) Comparing a mod band to a network cartoon, that's smarts. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:46 PM I guess that after playing with other people in the past few years that he can't go back to Meg's shitty drumming. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:47 PM Maybe Wanda Jackson will be the Stripes new drummer? Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:48 PM ^^Actually, I found the mentioning of an incredible, groundbreaking band such as the Jam in the same breath as such a derivative band like the White Stripes to be more idiotic/offensive. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:50 PM "Wow! Now I know what it must have felt like to hear that the Beatles broke up. This is heartbreaking and music will never be the same." lmao. best comment so far. :) Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:51 PM Meg will join Patti Smiths band. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:52 PM the simpsons have sucked far longer than they were great. kind of like weezer Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:53 PM the simpsons is still a great show. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:54 PM fuck Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:55 PM ^ that's funnier than the simpsons has been in the past 12 years Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:55 PM 1:44 "Want a real band? Try Mumford and Sons." hahahahahahahaha isn't that try a band that is just a rehash of 1000 other bands. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:56 PM Pretentiousness At Its Finest Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:56 PM if the White Stripes belong to me and I can do with them as I please, I'm going to send my White Stripes out on a small club tour immediately. then ATP. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:57 PM Only if you think that ripping off the Who and Motown is somehow more groundbreaking than ripping of Son House and Zeppelin. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 1:58 PM One of the Mumford's sons has more talent in his nose than Meg White's entire body. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:00 PM best boobs in rock Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:01 PM All this because of a leaked sex tape? Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:02 PM I was supposed to see them at ACL a few years back and then Meg hurt her finger and they cancelled. Dang, missed my chance... Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:03 PM "All this because of a leaked sex tape?" Indeed. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:03 PM if you guys comment enough hateful stuff, jack white will lash out at BV any minute Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:03 PM I got a letter this morning What do you reckon it read? It said the band you love is dead... FUCK. Though not surprising, this is really bad news on an already shitty day. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:06 PM woo hoo! best news I heard all year! Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:08 PM i say we take up a collection for hearing aids for anon 1:29/1:44 because if he thinks in any way the White Stripes 'Elephant' sounds like the Jam, then he obviously is audiologically-challenged. but i gotta give him credit for having the nerve/stupidity to actually write 'displorable' again. he probably also says 'supposeBly'and 'copasTetic.'

Posted by Displorable Commenter | February 2, 2011 2:14 PM Any band that inspires such passion, both negative and positive, clearly left its mark. Posted by JackWhiteShouldStandinforRobertPlantinZepReunion | February 2, 2011 2:16 PM SHOCKING. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:17 PM 1:44-way to compare mehmford and sons to the stripes. Not a huge fan of either but the fact that you put them in the same argument is hilarious. And btw Want a real band? Try tears for fears. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:18 PM wow, I know you people are ignorant, but seriously? They are only broken up until they either (1) play together again or (2) die, most like the former. Its such non-news, courtesy of the most self-absorbed, pretentious, overrated pop star. What could be more pretentious than a letter of this kind, touting his "art" and preserving the legacy, by breaking up! what fucking drama. When you can't afford the huge monthly lifestyle anymore, and the new, watered-down bands you keep putting together become less and less interesting and profitable, we will see you on the White Stripes reunion tour Jack! Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:21 PM "The White Stripes belong to you now. You can do with it whatever you want." Does that mean they're releasing their songs to the Public Domain? ;-) Posted by Adam | February 2, 2011 2:21 PM aw gee, this really ruins my day. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:22 PM Hey I'm 1:29/1:44 and whoever said I was a he? It's too funny how many accusations are presumed on this board. I'm just offering my side of the dime here. I give the Stripes credit for restarting the undercurrant in alternative rock with guitar bands but at least The Strokes have the gall to own up to their influences. Mumford and Sons pays much debt to older mans but Jack White acted like he invented the guitar. Meg was a shell of a woman and I don't understand why anyone felt she empowered female rock and rollers. This band casualty will soon be looked at as an etiquette transformation for music to move into the future. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:25 PM That was exactly my thought when I read that line, Adam 2:21. That would surprise me, but not surprise me, if that was the case! Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:25 PM When you can't afford the huge monthly lifestyle anymore, and the new, watered-down bands you keep putting together become less and less interesting and profitable, we will see you on the White Stripes reunion tour Jack! Rent is cheap in Nashville Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:26 PM Ugggh now the White Stripes belongs to everyone I wasted money being a member of the Stripes Vault! Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:27 PM This sucks, I guess Jack just wants to produce records by has-been old bags and complain about what "authenticity" really means. Jack kinda needed Meg. She kept him centered. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:27 PM was never a HUGE fan, but a bummer regardless. the white stripes had more personality than both of JW's other bands combined. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:29 PM I thought it was pretty well established that is WASN'T MEG on that sex tape. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:33 PM the white stripes did change the musical esthedic of many. They are a good band. But you only break up until you tour again. At some point they will. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 2:33 PM i say we take up a collection for anon 1:29/1:44 for the purchase of hearing aids because if he thinks in ANY way the White Stripes 'Elephant' sounds like the Jam, then he is audiologically-challenged. but i do give him credit for having the nerve/stupidity to actually write 'displorable' again. he probably also says 'supposeBly.' and anon 1:46 - when you say "Comparing a mod band to a network cartoon, that's smarts" are you saying i'm SMART for making the comparison, or it hurts? just wondering... and speaking of the simpsons, anon 1:53 - "the simpsons have sucked far longer than they were great." - WRONG. they've been on 21 years and i've been their since the beginning. agreed, they suck now, but the first 13 seasons on DVD are hilarious so they started sucking after that (maybe season 15 or 16). so they've been brilliant longer than they've sucked. case closed. and anyone who believes that was Meg in that sex tape is suffering from wishful thinking. girl on tape looks nothing like meg.

Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 3:06 PM 1:29/1:44/2:25, I think you need to get a better grasp on language. However, undercurrant might be a really nice name for and edgy flavor of tea. Also, Meg is NOT a shell of a woman. Show some respect. Posted by Perry | February 2, 2011 3:10 PM >>jack is already married with 2 kids and meg is married. they've been settled for a while I meant with each other. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 3:11 PM 3:11- get over the fantasy, they're a freaking band, not a soap opera. they're no longer banging. and they're not breaking up so they can start a family. they're breaking up so people will stop asking when they're getting back together Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 3:13 PM If you ever actually cared about the White Stripes - and even more pathetically, you STILL care - you really need to check your head. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 3:22 PM The fact everyone is saying "Coachella in a few years" is eventually going to make it less likely for bands to reunite because eventually the bubble will burst and it just won't be cool to reunite even if the money's there.

Yes I completely understand that making that statement will unleash more of the comments that prove this. Still, this is a very sad day. This is/was a great great band with amazing energy and style. The music they made will live on long after you and the impact you never made on anyone drift away. Hate on Jack White all you want(and believe me he gives you reason to many times) but the guy has been nothing if not a true artist who follows his muse wherever it takes him. Check out this piece written earlier today: http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657149/white-stripes-break-up.jhtml I would almost never quote something from MTV but i think the guy sums up very well what this band means to many many many people. Although i do disagree with the shows he picked as his faves. I saw all of those but mine would be the first show they ever played in the city and the Irving Plaza show a few years ago. 2 shows that blew me away with one being the promise of something amazing to come and the other an intimate crowning acknowledgement of what they were able to achieve. Thanks Jack and Meg and good luck to you in whatever you decide to do from now on. I will be there to watch and listen.

Posted by Smack | February 2, 2011 7:34 PM is this beginning of the end of "THE" bands? I hope so. Waiting for The Strokes to retire. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 7:37 PM Don't pick on Meg! She is a really nice, down-to-earth person, not a shell of a woman. And her jittery, off-kilter drumming really worked. It made the music endearing and homegrown. The White Stripes were a great band live and really groundbreaking at the time. The Strokes may have revived the New York scene but the White Stripes reminded us how influential Detroit-Ann Arbor was to American music. Meg never seemed to be a person that relished in fame and that made her a good foil for Jack. Maybe, she has another vision of herself. We all know where Jack's passions lie and look forward to his future projects. I loved the album he did with Loretta Lynn. I have seen them play small little bars to big venues and I always found them to be engaging. Ha, I even convinced my supervisor to hold our meeting that day to be an outside lunch meeting when they played the free show in Union Square. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 7:47 PM You know, this is a day similar to a time last spring when my favorite hummus shop closed down. As I strolled past one eventful afternoon and saw the metal gate locked down I realized I had ordered my last side order. At first a wave of sadness overtook me, I reminisced about the wonderful experiences I had in there dipping my pita triangles with such gusto. But after a few weeks of snooping around the neighborhood, I found a new spot which truly captivated my imagination with the way they added a slice of lime on the side. My point??? Well... The white stripes are like the old hummus shop. So keep on snooping around and you shall one day find your lemon slice..

RIP Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 10:31 PM CABS ARE HERE Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 10:58 PM White Stripes were a very good band, but i feel bad for you if they were one of your faves. Their music is simple & fun, but not alot to latch onto. Raconteurs are head & shoulders above The White Stripes. Much better musicianship, diverse styles...one could argue the same for Dead Weather even though they are def. a step down from both bands imo. My point being, shouldnt your favorite band be something a little meatier? i just never saw much there to latch onto for people to worship them the way they do. But i am a fan. Icky Thump ended up my favorite song...it just kicks so much ass. So much energy. Posted by Anonymous | February 2, 2011 11:02 PM What an incredibly pretentious letter that is. How self important and pointless. They haven't been a going concern for a while now. It would be much cooler to just not say anything and let it become obvious. To let it just slide into history. It's not like they had to cancel a tour and had to give this explanation to the ticket holders. Why the hell do we need a pretentious and pompous letter of resignation years after the band has effectively ended anyway? There's absolutely no information in that letter that is new news or isn't something that anyome with haf a brain couldn;t have figured out for themselves. Thanks Jack and Meg for making it official for the idiots that couldn;t figure it out for themselves. And while we're at it, thanks for nothing.

RIP Posted by Stiv bators was ratty | May 25, 2011 8:16 AM The White Stripes were one of the few great bands left in rock. The band let Jack White shine as a musician. Everyone who states on this site that Jack could find a better drummer ask yourself if Jack White's other bands put out anything as good as The White Stripes. I like The Raconteurs and The Dead Weather but neither of those bands music compared to the quality of The White Stripes. They will be missed if they stay apart and hopefully it will not be for long.

LIVE REVIEW: Neutral Milk Hotel at Prospect Park By Devon Maloney Bl'ast Return to NYC After 25 Years By Tony Rettman   Lists Top 10 White Stripes Songs To Get You Through Their Breakup By Rob Harvilla Wed., Feb. 2 2011 at 2:59 PM Categories: Featured, Goodbyes, Lists, The White Stripes So the White Stripes officially announced their breakup today. You are understandably depressed. Not shocked or devastated, probably -- they hadn't put out a record in four years, nor toured in about as long, nor generally much resembled an active band. And yet it's now time to regard the staggering back catalog they left behind, and lament that they won't be adding to it anytime soon. Here are 10 songs to get you started. "Ball and Biscuit" As previously mentioned, this is absolutely as vicious as it gets, guitar-solo-wise, in the Internet age. For some reason when I listen to this song I imagine the members of Maroon 5 assembled on the side of the stage, weeping and chastened. "Jolene" The '90s had their own iconic Dolly Parton cover; this was the 'aughts' worthy follow-up, every bit as histrionic, melodramatic, heartbreaking, unstoppable. The inevitable Jack White/Dolly Parton album (spring 2015) will be super intense. "I'm Finding It Harder to Be a Gentleman" One of their better song titles, riff-as-chorus monstrosities, and kiss-off anthems: "Have a doctor come and visit us/And tell us which one is sane" should be crocheted and hung in every family room. Also: "Maybe it's whatever's in my hand/That's distracting me." "Little Bird" It was fun to listen to this sing-song bit of slide-guitar nonsense in 2000 ("When I get you home/This is how it goes/I wanna preach the word/I wanna preach to birds"), before anyone realized this was about to take over the world. Start playing this in a Sam Ashe and they are legally obligated to give you the guitar for free. "We're Going to Be Friends" They could be awfully, awfully sweet, when they wanted to be.

The duo have announced that they are calling it quits. » LAUNCH PHOTO GALLERY Network News X Profile View More Activity USER POLL What's the greatest White Stripes single? TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By David Malitz Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday, February 2, 2011; 9:45 PM One of America's best rock bands is no more. In a statement on its Web site Wednesday, the White Stripes announced they have broken up. The split, the band said, was not due to artistic differences but "mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way." It makes sense that the White Stripes would announce their end suddenly and without fanfare. The duo of Jack and Meg White became one of the world's most popular bands - perhaps no current American act boasted a better combination of critical acclaim and box office power - by being rock stars who adhered to their own rules. The band could have cashed in on a farewell tour or simply soldiered on, headlining festivals and playing its blues-garage-rock scorchers for its fans. But Jack White, the duo's on-and-offstage voice, always seemed to respect rock-and-roll a little too much to do something so cliche. The conclusion of the band's breakup statement says as much: "The White Stripes do not belong to Meg and Jack anymore. The White Stripes belong to you now and you can do with it whatever you want. The beauty of art and music is that it can last forever if people want it to. Thank you for sharing this experience. Your involvement will never be lost on us and we are truly grateful." Early in the band's existence, Jack and Meg - formerly married - posed as siblings and were vague about their relationship in interviews. They wore red and white clothing, exclusively. Their second album, "De Stijl," was named after a 20th-century art movement based on simple and specific visual cues. The sound was a studied mixture of Detroit garage and electric blues. The band's musical style was what made stardom stick, though. It featured Jack White's virtuosic guitar playing pitted against Meg White's plodding drum work. Nobody doubted Jack's talent. Meg was sometimes derided for her rudimentary playing, but the contrast of Jack's scorching and Meg's thumping helped make the band unique. They gained mainstream notice in 2001 with "Fell in Love With a Girl," a 90-second tornado of a song that got them lumped in with acts such as the Strokes, the Hives and the Vines as part of a new garage rock revival. But the Stripes weren't newcomers. The track came from "White Blood Cells," their third album after a pair of raw, independent releases on which the band defined its aesthetic. The duo reached its peak on 2003's "Elephant," which found the band expanding its sound without losing any of the immediacy. It spawned "Seven Nation Army," the group's biggest hit, as well as the squalling "Ball and Biscuit," perhaps the White Stripes' definitive statement. Subsequent albums "Get Behind Me Satan" and "Icky Thump" were less essential but still pushed them to superstar status. The band became less active in recent years - it last toured in 2007 - as Jack performed with various side projects (the Raconteurs, the Dead Weather), focused on his Third Man Records label and became a sort of fairy godfather for such veteran acts as country star Loretta Lynn and rockabilly queen Wanda Jackson, producing their comeback albums and introducing them to a new generation. © 2011 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends' Activity Most Popular Twitter Activity Follow The Post: Facebook Twitter View More Activity

This is bad -- but not unexpected -- news. Jack seemingly starts a new project every year or two and the Stripes simple, punky songs have seemed increasingly at odds with the Zeppelinesque arena rock of The Dead Weather and, to a certain lesser extent, The Raconteurs. Jack doesn't talk to the media much and Meg doesn't talk at all so speculation is sure to run rampant in the near and far future. Especially since their official site with a full statement was crumpled by traffic after the news broke. "The reason is not due to artistic differences or lack of wanting to continue... It is for a myriad of reasons, but mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way," is what Pitchfork quoted. An image of the site before it crashed with the full statement is below along with some thoughts about this news. The White Stripes full statement about their break up. ​ The White Stripes were a true original. One of the greatest bands of my generation, certainly, and an act that I'll miss a lot. A few other thoughts: If You Didn't Get The Chance To See Them, You Have My Pity I had the good fortune of seeing them a few times -- once with The Strokes at Chene Park in Detroit in 2002, which was an amazing show of scenester force. I also saw them in a club with about 800 people in Cleveland and at a Mason Lodge in Detroit -- all amazing shows. The Stripes were incredible live even if Meg wasn't much of a drummer. I always wondered whether they'd be able to take their very simple show to the next level -- to be able to play arenas, just the two of them -- and now I guess we'll never find out. That idea always seemed odd to me, though, so in a way I'm relieved we'll never see them try to play a basketball arena... At least not until they re-unite to cash in when we're all old and gray. When a Band is Made Up of Exes this Seems Pretty Natural Sure, when you're recently divorced staying in your profitable little garage rock band with your ex makes sense -- it's your career and you have a well-established pattern of behavior. What about when you're famous, richer than fuck, married or dating other people and living in different cities? You'd have to imagine Jack's new wife and Meg's beau weren't crazy about them touring or recording in close quarters, even if they had enough cash to keep those quarters from being too close. But, beyond that, both of them have grown and evolved a lot as people. And they no longer have a reason to keep this little band together. They probably don't relate to each other the same way -- and their relationship is where the band's gravitas came from.  What's Meg Going to Do Now? Probably Nothing that Means She'll Be On Stage Meg's sex tape leak might have been the ultimate end of this band. She's a shy girl and knowing a certain percentage of the crowd had seen her named and engaged in coitus probably bothered her more than she'll ever say. That's a shame -- the band was victimized by the blogosphere that they didn't really owe shit to, having come up through NME and the American glossies, but which obsessed over them. Sad. Jack White Will Never Be in a Better Band I realize I'm in the minority in my extreme ambivalence toward anything Jack has done that isn't either with the White Stripes, by Loretta Lynn or the first Raconteurs record, but everyone out there should be able to appreciate that the Stripes were something new, beautiful and precious whereas his other acts are just dudes with guitars playing rock music. He had one amazing vision and he saw it out. The band became the biggest of their era -- that's awesome. But it'll get harder and harder to watch his other projects become less and less unique. Here's the band doing what they do best. And, for the record, I've been inside the elevator at the Hotel Yorba. It's scary.

I am a fan of the Cold Stares and have no idea who rick is, but he's not in their band- just the same that you aren't in the white stripes. "bro" you are so cool "bro" Fred G. Sanford 5pts Thank you White Stripes for exiting the music world. You music only appeals to hipsters and Emo's who are borderline goths. Please go away now. Fav 5pts Fred, shows how out of touch you are. Having sold millions of records, they are way out of reach of any hipster community. They have massive international appeal and success, and have toured extensively. Jack has openly citicized the hipster mentality and the indie scenes that bred him. You also show your age by equating hipsters and emo's. I havent heard of any emo scene in years now. Ulysees 5pts Yes, the White Stripes had their time- and certainly left some good records behind, but this is not the end of rock and roll. I'm from Nashville- and the best 2 piece band I've ever seen is The Cold Stares, also from here. Jack is much better in the Raconteurs anyways imo. Fav 5pts I've seen you post on other websites (NYTimes, and others) shamelessly plugging "The Cold Stares" on any article commemorating The White Stripes. The Cold Stares are not better, and certainly haven’t had a tenth of the impact TWS have had in the past 10 years. Next time you try plugging your band, try doing it in a way that doesn’t try to diminish the memory of a far superior band. Just google "the white stripes" and the cold stares, this guy Rick from Nashville has been flooding every recent white stripes news story to plug his band.
