Vonn was airlifted to hospital after rupturing cruciate ligaments in her right knee but she should be back to defend her Games title at Sochi 2014. The crash happened on Tuesday during the women's super-G event. A helicopter was immediately called with medics treating the 28-year-old American on the slope for 12 minutes. The United States ski team said Vonn tore her anterior and medial cruciate ligaments in her right knee and fractured a bone in her lower leg. Lindsey Vonn factfile Born: Minnesota, United States, 18 October 1984 2000: World Cup debut aged 16 in Park City, Utah 2002: Competes at Winter Olympics in Utah aged 17 in downhill and combined 2004: Claims first World Cup race win at Lake Louise in Canada 2008: Wins first World Cup title to become only the second American woman to lift the trophy 2009: Wins World Championships in Val-d'Isère, France, and becomes first American to win women's world Super-G title 2010: Wins downhill gold at Winter Olympics 2011: Loses World Cup overall title to friend Maria Riesch 2012: Regains World Cup overall title. Request to compete in a men's World Cup downhill ski race rejected Vonn, a four-times overall World Cup champion, was 0.12 seconds outside the time of race leader and eventual winner Tina Maze of Slovenia when she fell. The 2009 world downhill and super-G champion appeared to land on the side of her ski after a jump and flipped over before crashing into a safety gate. The race at Schladming, which had been delayed by three and a half hours because of fog, continued after Vonn was taken to a local hospital but Maria Hoefl-Riesch and Anna Fenninger also dropped out after mistakes on their runs. Switzerland's Fabienne Suter, who finished fifth, described the problems with visibility on the run. "It's not a very difficult course but in some parts you couldn't see anything," she said. Maze won in a time of one minute, 35.39 seconds, with Britain's Chemmy Alcott 24th (1:38.18). Vonn made her World Cup debut aged just 16 in 2000 before competing at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah. In 2008, she claimed her first World Cup title to become only the second American woman to lift the trophy. The Minnesota-born skier went on to secure gold in the downhill event at the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010 and also took bronze in the super-G. Vonn's request to compete in a men's World Cup downhill ski race was rejected by the International Ski Federation (FIS) last year.

Dr. Bill Sterett, a physician for the U.S. Ski Team, performed the procedure on the four-time overall World Cup champion Sunday morning in Vail, Colo. In a release issued by the ski team, Sterett said the surgery went well and that she was resting comfortably. "The overall success rate for ACL/MCL surgery is very good. Modern surgical techniques combined with aggressive rehabilitation will help Lindsey make a full recovery," said Sterett, who's also a surgeon at Vail-Summit Orthopaedics. "She will do everything in her power to return as quickly as possible to competitive skiing." Vonn tore her anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments last week during the super-G in Schladming, Austria. She also broke a bone in her lower leg. Sterett said it was too early to issue a specific prognosis and didn't have a return date to skiing for Vonn. But other doctors believe she could be sidelined for up to eight months. That would give her time to get back to the slopes for the 2014 Sochi Winter Games, which are a year away. Shortly after her accident, Vonn said she fully intended to be in the starting gate for Sochi to defend her Olympic downhill title from the 2010 Vancouver Games. The 28-year-old Vonn was hurt last Tuesday when she was lifted into the air off a jump in the opening race at the championships. Upon landing, her right leg gave way and she spun down face first, throwing an arm out to protect herself. Vonn ended up on her back as she smashed through a gate. She received medical treatment on the snow before being airlifted by helicopter to a hospital in Schladming. A few days, later she flew home to Vail. This has been an injury- and illness-riddled season for Vonn. She took a monthlong break from the World Cup circuit to regain her strength after an intestinal illness that struck in November. When she returned, she looked like the Vonn of old as she steadily regained her form and won two races last month. Her win in the giant slalom at Maribor, Slovenia, on Jan. 26 was the 59th victory of her career. She's three away from tying the women's record held by Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria. While her primary goal is to be ready for Sochi, Vonn ideally wants to be back for the World Cup speed races in Lake Louise, Alberta, in late November or early December. She's been so successful there – winning 14 times – that it's become known as "Lake Lindsey." Comebacks are hardly new for Vonn, who has been plagued by injuries at her last six major championships – from a thumb she sliced on a champagne bottle at the 2009 worlds in Val d'Isere, France, to a bruised shin that she treated with the unorthodox remedy of Austrian cheese at the Vancouver Olympics. ___ AP Sports Writer Andrew Dampf in Schladming, Austria, contributed.

(Luca Bruno / AP) Update: Vonn has torn ACL, MCL, tibia fracture Skier Lindsey Vonn was taken off a mountain by helicopter after she crashed and suffered a knee injury during a Super-G race on the opening day of the alpine skiing world championships in Schladming, Austria. Peter Schroecksnadel, president of the Austrian ski federation, said that doctors had told him that Vonn tore cruciate and lateral ligaments. “That’s the only injury she has, nothing besides this,” Schroecksnadel said. The four-time overall World Cup champion was injured when she struck a gate after losing her balance as she landed after a jump. She was treated on the slope for 12 minutes, according to the Associated Press, then was lifted off the mountain. The crash comes almost exactly one year from the beginning of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Vonn, 28, was trailing Tina Maze of Slovenia, the eventual winner, by 0.12 seconds at the time of her run. Tina Maze was shocked to see Vonn crash. (Leonhard Foeger / Reuters) The race had been delayed over three hours because of fog. “It’s not a very difficult course,” Switzerland’s Fabienne Suter told BBC.com, “but in some parts you couldn’t see anything.” Vonn is lifted to the chopper. (Hand Klaus Techt / APA) In a YouTube video of the crash, her right knee appears to awkwardly bend inwardly as she lands and then she collapses. Vonn was troubled by intestinal injuries that sidelined her until last month and has suffered a number of injuries over her career. “Finally,” she said Sunday, she was healthy entering this competition. “I’m definitely getting ready to get my game face on.” Keep checking back for further details.

HAYLEY MICK The Globe and Mail Published Monday, Feb. 25 2013, 12:21 AM EST Last updated Monday, Feb. 25 2013, 12:21 AM EST Comments Print / License AA This could have been the year ski racer Tina Maze finally dethroned her rival, American powerhouse Lindsey Vonn. But with Vonn sidelined by a serious knee injury, Maze has settled on making history instead. On Sunday, the 29-year-old Slovenian capped her sensational season by clinching the overall World Cup title. By winning a super-combined race on Sunday in Méribel, France, she also tied the single-season record for most podiums with her 18th of the season. With nine races left, Maze, who already has 1,844 points, could smash the all-time single-season record of 2,000 points held by Austrian great Hermann Maier on the men’s side (each victory is worth 100 points). More Related to this Story Tina Maze wins race and overall World Cup Curling Canada’s wheelchair curling team strikes gold in Russia Kingsbury, Robichaud triumph for Canada in freestyle skiing “This is a date to remember,” Maze, who won two silver medals at the Vancouver Olympics, tweeted on Sunday. Sunday’s second-place finisher, Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany, is also second in the overall standings, but a whopping 958 points behind Maze. Vonn has won the overall title four of the past five years, and this year is still third overall with 740 points, despite suffering a season-ending knee injury – two shredded ligaments and a broken bone – on Feb. 5. She has vowed to return in time for the Sochi Olympics. In Sochi, Canada earned gold on Saturday at the world wheelchair curling championship. It was the third world title in the past four years for the team led by Canadian skip Jim Armstrong of Cambridge, Ont. They beat Sweden 4-3 at the Ice Cube Curling Centre, the 2014 Olympic and Paralympic venue. At the Nordic world ski championships on Sunday, Canada finished inches short of a bronze medal. Devon Kershaw, 30, and Alex Harvey, 24, wound up fourth in the team sprint, a disappointing finish for the reigning world champions. “We were fourth at the Olympics, and now fourth here at the world championships and that is hard to take,” said Kershaw, of Sudbury. He raced the opening leg of the sprint with Harvey, of Saint-Ferréol-les-Neiges, Que., in the anchor role. Alexei Petukhov and Nikita Kriukov of Russia beat Sweden’s Marcus Hellner and Emil Joensson by 0.4 seconds to win. At a World Cup event in Moscow, alpine snowboard racer Caroline Calvé of Aylmer, Que., continued her breakthrough season, winning her first title in parallel slalom. The six-year national-team veteran sits third overall in the World Cup standings in both parallel giant slalom and parallel slalom, a discipline that will make its Olympic debut in Sochi. Alexandre Bilodeau of Montreal, the 2010 Olympic gold medalist and current dual world champion, was the only Canadian to earn a medal on Sunday at a dual moguls competition in Inawashiro, Japan. His silver behind Bradley Wilson of the United States was the highlight in an otherwise disappointing day for Canada’s powerhouse freestyle ski team, which advanced five men and four women to the final round of 16. Still, they had already won four medals in singles moguls skiing a day earlier. On the women’s side, Audrey Robichaud of Quebec City took gold and Chloé Dufour-Lapointe of Montreal edged out her sister, Justine, for the bronze. Among the men, Mikael Kingsbury of Deux-Montagnes, Que., who leads the overall World Cup rankings, won gold, while Bilodeau captured bronze.

The broken bone was described as a lateral tibial plateau fracture. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Wednesday, February 6, 2013, 10:23 AM A A A YouTube U.S. skiing star Lindsey Vonn crashes during the world championships in Austria Tuesday. SCHLADMING, Austria - Lindsey Vonn will head home for surgery in Colorado next week after tearing two ligaments in her right knee and breaking a bone in her lower leg in a crash at the world championships. Vonn said Wednesday that she plans to compete in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, which start in 12 months. She was released from the hospital late Tuesday and returned to the team hotel. “I am grateful to my fans for the outpouring of support, which has really helped me stay positive,” Vonn said in a statement. “I can assure you that I will work as hard as humanly possible to be ready to represent my country next year in Sochi.” The Olympic downhill champion will have surgery next week in Vail, Colo. Because of intense media attention, neither she nor the U.S. Ski Team would say when she’s leaving Austria. FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images The American skiing superstar is airlifted from the women's super-G course. “She’ll be heading back to Vail (Colorado) and I will be doing surgery on her knee early next week,” team physician William Sterett told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “Lindsey is doing well,” said Sterett, who has been treating Vonn since her youth. “She’s in good spirits.” Vonn, who was airlifted to the hospital, tore her anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in her right knee. The broken bone was described as a lateral tibial plateau fracture. Luca Bruno/AP Lindsey Vonn suffers serious knee injuries during the crash and will have surgery in Colorado. “The fracture is called an impaction fracture,” Sterett said. “It should not require any surgery. It just needs to be non-weight on crutches.” Sterett would not set a return date to skiing for Vonn until after the surgery, but other doctors believe she will be sidelined for up to eight months. The U.S. team said the four-time overall champion will be back in time for the next World Cup season. SABO, ROBERT/NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Lindsey Vonn is the face of skiing in the United States. The accident happened after Vonn landed a jump in the opening super-G race at the championships. As she hit the ground, her right leg gave way and she spun forward. She ended up on her back as she smashed through a gate. “The hospital staff did an excellent job with X-rays, MRI,” Sterett said. “She had very good care and they were very, very helpful.” Sterett said Vonn was “a little banged up, and sore everywhere.” Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Lindsey Vonn attends the 2010 Ski and Snowboard Ball in New York City in 2010. “She’s intently focusing on the next step and the next step now is getting from point A to point B, with point B being next season,” he said. “She’s determined and upbeat.” Sterett left open the possibility of Vonn requiring more than one surgery, saying that with these types of injuries “that’s always a possibility.” However, the plan for now was only one operation. “I want to say thank you to the amazing medical staff that cared for me,” Vonn said. “I plan on returning to Vail as soon as I can to have the necessary surgeries.” MOBILE USERS: CLICK HERE FOR VIDEO Related Gallery: View Gallery Alpine World Skiing Championships - Men's Super G Related Stories Lindsey Vonn airlifted to hospital after Austrian crash "); jQuery.getScript("http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"); OBR.extern.researchWidget(); console.log("GOOGLESURVEYDONE CALLED"); console.log("OBR.extern.researchWidget CALLED"); } Comments Post A Comment [ Discussion Guidelines] To Post Comments Sign In BY Hank Gola July 24, 7:33AM USGA kicks off Play 9 initiative at Neshanic Valley Mike Davis, the USGA’s executive director, found the best way to promote the organization’s Play 9 Day Wednesday.
