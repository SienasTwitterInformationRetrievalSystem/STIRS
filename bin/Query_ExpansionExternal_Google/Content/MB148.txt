For years, rich foreigners, especially Russians, socked away cash in Cypriot banks as offshore havens, The Economist reports, eventually leading to bank holdings worth more than 800 percent of the Cyprus' GDP. But the huge holdings made a bailout built around loans, simliar to bailouts in Ireland and Greece, nearly impossible. Instead, the International Monetary Fund and European Union are attempting a "bail in," in which a tax is levied on all Cypriot bank accounts to offset the bailout's 10 billion euro price tag. Many Cypriots have reacted strongly against the plan, which would impose a 6.75 percent haircut even on bank accounts with balances less than 100,000 euros in its initial terms, according to The Daily Beast. On Tuesday, Cypriots staged protests outside the House of Representatives in the capital, Nicosia, which were "expected to be one of the biggest the country has seen to date," according to Greek newspaper E Kathimerini. Much of the protesters' anger was directed at the German government ministers they see as being behind the bailout's onerous conditions. The Cyprus Weekly reports one demonstrator tore down the flag at the German Embassy in Nicosia and threw it on the ground. While the exact number of transactions is unknown, many Cypriots have begun withdrawing their cash, as both The Toronto Star and NPR report long lines waiting at the island's ATMs. According to NPR, Cyprus' banks will remain closed through Tuesday in hopes of preventing the run from spiraling out of control.

The eurozone bailout has heightened frustration at the government. “People wake up, they are sucking your blood,” said one sign. “Death to Merkel,” said another. The country’s youth are also expressing concerns about their future: “‘Troika’ will bring us to the point that we have no future. We cannot find a job,” a Cypriot student told RIA Novosti. As protesters took to the streets on Tuesday, Bank of Cyprus Chair Andreas Artemis submitted his resignation in opposition to plans to restructure the bank. Unrest has widened following the $13-billion bailout deal which has seen the freezing of deposits over €100,000. A withdrawal limit has been imposed on ATMs, and capital controls are in place to prevent the movement of funds. The eurozone bailout did not alleviate the island nation's worries. Residents who have not taken to the streets in anger are also feeling the pinch, especially with the central bank remaining closed. Cypriots feel that a line has been crossed, and are worried about cash flow, jobs and savings. Even the manager of the Bank of Cyprus, Demetris Antoniou, fears for his employment prospects: “For the first time in my life – for 30 years – I worried. And the last week, and especially in the last two days. I worried a lot. It was like… I was going to wake up, and listen to the news that I don’t have a job anymore. And I’m 50. I’m not 20. To start my life and say ‘okay.’” “It is like they want to push us – the Bank of Cyprus – after a few months, to collapse? I wonder – what is this? It’s not fair,” he added. The bailout plan has been met with widespread anger, with few residents welcoming the deal. “They’re very frustrated,” said RT correspondent Tesa Arcilla, who is in Cyprus. “This has really sent a very bad message to people. They’ve lost confidence, they’ve lost trust.” All Cypriot banks will remain closed until Thursday, despite an announcement late on Monday that they would reopen on Tuesday morning. The move has prompted concern that the country’s financial institutions are even lower on cash than expected. Laiki Bank will essentially be shut down, resulting in widespread job-losses, which also prompted hundreds to protest over the past few days. Demonstrators at previous rallies wielded signs declaring that they would rather die standing than live in debt: “We won’t [be] Germany’s slaves,” one read. Capital controls are still in place in Cyprus, meaning that banks are able to impose restrictions on the amount of money citizens are able to take from the ATMs, or how much money they can move around. “We have no cash. We are just… queueing behind the ATM machines, waiting to get some cash. For how long?” one resident said. The restrictions are creating an intense atmosphere of uncertainty, and some mild hoarding of cash supplies. “Everybody is trying to hold onto those 5 or 10 euros that they have just in case there’re even lower limits, because right now they can only take about 100 euros,” Arcilla reported. Some are even feeling nostalgic for the old Cypriot pound. “With the pounds – peace and quiet,” another resident said. “It’s better to go back to the pound.” The recent events in Cyprus have prompted fears that similar moves could be enforced in other countries, and could be a template for how problems are dealt with in the future. “If there is a risk in a bank, our first question should be 'Okay, what are you in the bank going to do about that? What can you do to recapitalize yourself?' If the bank can't do it, then we'll talk to the shareholders and the bondholders, we'll ask them to contribute in recapitalizing the bank, and if necessary the uninsured deposit holders,” Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem told Reuters. There is additional concern that Germany may have been trying to make an example of the country, and that a precedent has been set for potential future bailouts. “If there’s unrest in Cyprus – it’s not Portugal. It’s not Spain, it’s not Greece – it’s not a massive country. So what Germany was actually able to do was to enforce its might on a small country in which any kind of unrest, violence or protest will be relatively contained,” said Financial Advisor Margaret Bogenrief, co-founder of ACM Partners. “If you’ve been reading the press – they’ve been extremely upset about footing the bills for these other countries, and I think what they were saying was ‘look, just to let you guys know – we can do this,’” she concluded.

Last Modified: 26 Mar 2013 16:20 Protesters have marched near the presidential palace in Cyprus, as questions over the bailout package for the financially crippled island linger with the resignation of the chairman of the country's largest commercial bank.   As protesters took to the streets on Tuesday, Bank of Cyprus Chairman Andreas Artemis submitted his resignation opposing plans to restructure the bank, Al Jazeera's John Psaropoulos, reporting from Nicosia, said. The refinancing and restructuring plan of the Bank of Cyprus requires it to absorb the deposits of another financial institution called Laiki Bank, which has been shuttered.     As banks remained closed nationwide for the second week, an estimated 1,500 protesters gathered in the capital Nicosia to denounce the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund creditors. The protesters, many of them students who organised the event online, were cheered on by government workers as they marched past the labour ministry. "Troika out of Cyprus," said banners held by the angry students, in reference to the three creditors. "Hands off Cyprus," and "Those who stole our money should go to jail and pay," chanted the demonstrators. Cyprus secured a deal with international lenders on Monday for a $13bn bailout that helped it avert bankruptcy, but which will see large deposit-holders at its two biggest banks losing much of their savings. The bailout involves depositors in the two biggest banks paying huge levies on deposits more than $130,000. It also effectively shuts down Laiki, the island's second-largest lender also known as Popular Bank. The country's finance minister Michalis Sarris also conceded that big depositors could lose as much as 40 percent of their funds. On Tuesday, Cypriots woke to find banks under lockdown for an 11th day after authorities reversed course and kept them closed to prevent a run on deposits following the bailout. Greek precedent Our correspondent John Psaropoulos said that despite the bailout package, citizens were "extremely worried" about the medium and long-term economic health of the country. Psaropoulos said people were concerned about "the Greek precedent" of a weak economy and high unemployment.  Our correpondent also said the resignation at the Bank of Cyprus "taps into the major concern" whether the bank can absorb the assets and liabilties of the shuttered Laiki Bank and remain solvent.      The student protest will be followed by a leftwing anti-austerity demonstration organised by the communist Akel party for 16:00 GMT on Wednesday outside the presidential palace. "We don't know what our future is, and we are angry that it will not stop at those measures," said one of the youths who only gave his name as Christos, 16. "This why we... came out to express our opinion." The bank closures have hit businesses, which have found themselves unable to pay suppliers or fulfil orders. The retail market is sharply down too, shop owners say, with customers unwilling to spend on anything but the basics while they have limited access to cash. "The continuation of this uncertainty is pushing the economy deeper into recession, but we're hopeful once this situation is sorted out, the market can rebound quickly,'' said Michalis Pilikos, head of a business group. 523 Source: Al Jazeera And Agencies Topics in this article People John Psaropoulos Andreas Artemis Michalis Pilikos Michalis Sarris Country Cyprus City Nicosia Organisation European Central Bank European Union Cyprus Employers and Industrialists Federation International Monetary Fund Akel party Featured on Al Jazeera Migrants in Italy: Arrival and survival Italy struggles to deal with growing flood of migrants willing to risk their lives to reach the nearest European shores.

But they were merely expressing the will of the people — or at least those who'd gathered outside the House of Representatives in Nicosia Tuesday to protest the deal. We reached out to Christina Avraam, a photographer and Erasmus Program Assistant at University of Nicosia, who attended the demonstration. She was kind enough to pass her notes and pictures of the event.   Huge thanks to Christina for the pics! "We were around 2,000 people I believe - maybe more." Christina Avraam "Surprisingly there were a lot of elders there that were protesting and sharing their views on the streets." Christina Avraam "It was nice to see our country unite like this." Christina Avraam "We had people from so many different countries there supporting us by bearing their flags..." Christina Avraam "...mainly Russia and Spain (who brought their own signs in Russian or Spanish.)" Christina Avraam "We were united, powerful and did not cause any trouble for anyone." Christina Avraam "We just wanted justice." Christina Avraam "We were there for around 3 hours..."

Failure to secure emergency loans from the EU would leave Cyprus facing a banking collapse and default. The bailout, while small compared to the rescue packages for other troubled EU nations like Greece, represents more than half the size of the €18 billion Cyprus economy. The proposed tax on deposits, unprecedented in a eurozone bailout, led to a run on cash machines in Cyprus over the weekend, sparked big protests outside parliament and shook financial markets Monday. Officials had made changes to the proposals to protect depositors with less than €20,000 euros in their accounts, but plans to levy a tax of 6.75% on deposits of €20,000-€100,000 and 9.9% on anything above €100,000 proved unacceptable to parliament. The party of President Nicos Anastasiades, who negotiated the deal with the EU, abstained. In response, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on German public broadcaster ZDF that European officials "regret" the vote by Cyprus rejecting the tax. "Cyprus has a banking sector that is way too big and they are insolvent with that model and no one outside of Cyprus is at fault for that," Schaeuble said. "This business model is not sustainable, there is no alternative." The official response from Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem was terse. He said the Eurogroup "took note" of Tuesday's vote but stood by its position that any rescue plan would come with strings attached. In Cyprus, the banks will remain closed until at least Thursday. Unable to function without the services of the banking sector, the Cyprus Stock Exchange has announced it will stay closed as well. ATMs were still functioning, according to CNN reporters. Related story: 5 reasons Cyprus bailout matters The most controversial provision of the bailout was the tax on deposits, which are protected in Cyprus, as in the rest of the EU, to a level of €100,000. As compensation, depositors would have been offered bank shares, underwritten by income from as-yet undeveloped natural gas deposits in Cypriot waters. Cyprus was reluctant to increase the levy on larger amounts. It feared it would scare away international investors drawn by its low corporate tax rate and open economy -- in particular, Russians who hold as much as a third of the country's bank deposits. The country first asked the EU for help last June. But talks were hampered by the reluctance of a previous government to accept terms, and also by EU concerns about money laundering. Related story: Why Russia is irate about the Cyprus bank tax Russia has come to Cyprus' aid in the past, providing a €2.5 billion loan in 2011 to shore up government finances. But its participation in the new rescue was looking uncertain after President Vladimir Putin attacked the tax on bank deposits as "unprofessional and dangerous". A finance ministry spokesman said Russia was reviewing its position after not being consulted on the decision to impose the levy. Cypriot Finance Minister Michalis Sarris was traveling to Moscow for talks on Wednesday. Cyprus is the fourth of 17 eurozone states to be granted a bailout by its EU partners and the IMF, after Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Spain has been given EU assistance to rescue its banks, but has so far avoided asking for a full sovereign bailout. -- CNN's Jim Boulden and Christine Theodorou contributed to this article First Published: March 19, 2013: 6:39 AM ET Join the Conversation Most Popular Chinese homebuyers are flocking to these U.S. states Microsoft's most boneheaded product is about to be killed off The 4 biggest mistakes investors are making - The Buzz Mortgage & Savings Center Mortgages Insurance Credit Cards CDs Overnight Avg Rate Latest Change Last Week 30 yr fixed 4.27% 4.22% 15 yr fixed 3.27% 3.27% 5/1 ARM 3.35% 3.48% 30 yr refi 4.23% 4.20% 15 yr refi 3.25% 3.25% Find the best auto, life, home, health rates Enter Zip code: Select a product: Auto Home Life Long-Term Care Health Insurance news and resources from BankRate Renovating?
