Please read our Legal Terms & Policies A A A Email The Government of Haiti has agreed to issue its exiled former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide with a diplomatic passport, paving the way for a return which promises to further cloud the country's muddy political waters. Lawyers for Mr Aristide, who has been living in South Africa since he was ousted in a 2004 coup, were assured yesterday that Haiti's cabinet would issue the document, should he choose to submit the necessary paperwork. The decision removes a final hurdle preventing the left-leaning former president from carrying out his promise to return to Haiti "today, tomorrow, at any time", to help the nation rebuild after the earthquake which destroyed its capital city and killed as many as 300,000 people just over a year ago. It nonetheless comes at a tricky moment. Today will see the official announcement of results from the first round of Haiti's most recent presidential elections, which took place in November and have since sparked occasional public unrest amid allegations of voter fraud. Mr Aristide's former party, the Famni Lavalas, was banned from that poll on a technicality, after mistakes were discovered in paperwork it submitted to organisers. His presence in the country will inevitably add to pressure for the entire election to be scrapped and repeated. Further intrigue surrounds the fact that Mr Aristide, 57, will join his lifelong bête noire, Jean-Claude Duvalier, the former dictator known as Baby Doc, in Haiti. Their joint return from exile will further polarise an already-tense political environment. Mr Aristide, a former Catholic preacher who replaced Mr Duvalier as Haiti's first democratically elected leader in 1986, is romanticised by poorer Haitians, who continue to support his Famni Lavalas in large numbers. Supporters say that coups which twice removed him from office, in 1991 and 2004, were orchestrated by the US government after he enacted economic reforms – including trade tariffs and increased minimum wages – which damaged American business interests. Opponents have accused him of corruption and human rights abuses, however.

Writing in the Guardian, Aristide says that his seven-year exile, most recently in South Africa, is at an end. "I will return to Haiti," he writes. His statement of intent comes just days after the ruling Haitian government removed the major impediment to his return by promising to grant him a passport. Calls within Haiti and around the world for the former president to be allowed back have grown steadily in recent weeks. Were Aristide to set foot back in Haiti it would be a potentially explosive move. The country has been politically paralysed since the November presidential elections which were marred, international observers said, by deep malpractice. This week the government-backed candidate, Jude Celestin, was removed from the race, leaving a former first lady Mirlande Manigat and a carnival singer Michel Martelly to fight the final round next month. The US, long the main external force over Haiti, has once again exerted strong influence with Hillary Clinton travelling to the country this week to press Washington's case. But the credibility of the election remains in doubt because Aristide's party, Famni Lavalas, which has a huge following particularly among poorer voters in the urban slums, was barred from standing supposedly for technical reasons. A return would almost certainly add to the calls for the election to be scrapped and a whole new ballot to be held. Aristide has been a divisive political figure since he became the first democratically elected president of Haiti in 1991. After a brief first stint in the presidential palace, he served two further terms, in 1994-96 and 2001-2004, being ousted in coups on both occasions. In 2004 he was removed from the country with the complicity of the US government and has been in exile ever since. Many poorer Haitians came to adore this former Catholic priest and his progressive policies. But he also acquired a reputation for human rights abuses and corruption that led to disillusionment among many previously confirmed supporters. In his Guardian article Aristide softens the potentially seismic impact of any return by emphasising his desire to serve his country not politically but as an educationalist. He refers to the "deepening destabilising political crisis" but only in terms of its impact on learning. But he does refer to the "profit-driven, exclusionary" way in which Haiti has been rebuilt since the devastating earthquake in January 2010 which killed up to 300,000. He pointedly says it has been led by "non-Haitians", which contains a hint of his anti-US, anti-colonialist leadership style. If and when he does return, he will join his old nemesis, Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier, the dictator who preceded Aristide's first term in office who returned to Haiti last month after 25 years in exile. Duvalier now faces official accusations of human rights abuses. Sign up for the Guardian Today Our editors' picks for the day's top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.

The quake left a gaping hole in the vocational training vital to reconstruction Photograph: Ramon Espinosa/AP Haiti's devastating earthquake in January last year destroyed up to 5,000 schools and 80% of the country's already weak university infrastructure. The primary school in Port-au-Prince that I attended as a small boy collapsed with more than 200 students inside. The weight of the state nursing school killed 150 future nurses. The state medical school was levelled. The exact number of students, teachers, professors, librarians, researchers, academics and administrators lost during those 65 seconds that irrevocably changed Haiti will never be known. But what we do know is that it cannot end there. The exceptional resilience demonstrated by the Haitian people during and after the deadly earthquake reflects the intelligence and determination of parents, especially mothers, to keep their children alive and to give them a better future, and the eagerness of youth to learn – all this despite economic challenges, social barriers, political crisis, and psychological trauma. Even though their basic needs have increased exponentially, their readiness to learn is manifest. This natural thirst for education is the foundation for a successful learning process: what is freely learned is best learned. Of course, learning is strengthened and solidified when it occurs in a safe, secure and normal environment. Hence our responsibility to promote social cohesion, democratic growth, sustainable development, self-determination; in short, the goals set forth for this new millennium. All of which represent steps towards a return to a better environment. Education has been a top priority since the first Lavalas government – of which I was president – was sworn into officeunder Haiti's amended democratic constitution on 7 February 1991 (and removed a few months later). More schools were built in the 10 years between 1994, when democracy was restored, and 2004 – when Haiti's democracy was once again violated – than between 1804 to 1994: one hundred and ninety-five new primary schools and 104 new public high schools constructed and/or refurbished. The 12 January earthquake largely spared the Foundation for Democracy I founded in 1996. Immediately following the quake, thousands accustomed to finding a democratic space to meet, debate and receive services, came seeking shelter and help. Haitian doctors who began their training at the foundation's medical school rallied to organised clinics at the foundation and at tent camps across the capital. They continue to contribute tirelessly to the treatment of fellow Haitians who have been infected by cholera. Their presence is a pledge to reverse the dire ratio of one doctor for every 11,000 Haitians. Youths, who through the years have participated in the foundation's multiple literacy programmes, volunteered to operate mobile schools in these same tent camps. In partnership with a group from the University of Michigan in the US, post-traumatic counselling sessions were organised and university students trained to help themselves and to help fellow Haitians begin the long journey to healing. A year on, young people and students look to the foundation's university to return to its educational vocation and help fill the gaping national hole left on the day the earth shook in Haiti. Will the deepening destabilising political crisis in Haiti prevent students achieving academic success? I suppose most students, educators and parents are exhausted by the complexity of such a dramatic and painful crisis. But I am certain nothing can extinguish their collective thirst for education. The renowned American poet and essayist, Ralph Waldo Emerson, wrote that "we learn geology the morning after the earthquake". What we have learned in one long year of mourning after Haiti's earthquake is that an exogenous plan of reconstruction – one that is profit-driven, exclusionary, conceived of and implemented by non-Haitians – cannot reconstruct Haiti. It is the solemn obligation of all Haitians to join in the reconstruction and to have a voice in the direction of the nation. As I have not ceased to say since 29 February 2004, from exile in Central Africa, Jamaica and now South Africa, I will return to Haiti to the field I know best and love: education. We can only agree with the words of the great Nelson Mandela, that indeed education is a powerful weapon for changing the world.

After taping interviews on five big Sunday talk shows about Egypt, she then boarded a plane to Haiti. Yes, Haiti. The most impoverished country in the hemisphere, not exactly a “strategic ally” or a global player on the world’s political stage. Inquiring minds might want to know why the United States’ top foreign policy official would have to go to Haiti in the midst of the worst crisis she has faced. The answer is that there is also a crisis in Haiti. And it is a crisis that – unlike the humanitarian crisis that Haiti has suffered since the earthquake last year – Washington really cares about. Like the Egyptians, Haitians are calling for free and fair elections. But in this case Washington will not support free and fair elections, even nominally. Quite the opposite, in fact. For weeks now the U.S. government has been threatening the government of Haiti with various punishments if it refuses to reverse the results of the first round of its presidential elections. Washington wants Haiti to eliminate the government’s candidate and leave only two right-wing candidates to compete in the second round. Just three weeks ago it looked like a done deal. The Organization of American States (OAS) “Expert Verification Mission” did a report on Haiti’s Nov. 28 presidential elections, and on Jan. 10 it was leaked to the press. The report recommended moving the government’s candidate, Jude Celestin, into third place by just 0.3 percent of the vote; leaving right-wing candidates Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, and Michel Martelly, a popular musician, in first and second place, respectively. This was followed with various statements and threats from U.S. and French officials that Haiti must accept this change of result. U.S. officials strongly implied that aid to Haiti would be cut if the government didn’t do as told. It looked as if desperately poor Haiti would have to give in immediately. But then there was push-back. President Preval noted that six of the seven “experts” from the OAS Mission were from the U.S., Canada, and France – the three countries that led the effort to overthrow Haiti’s first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in 2004. Then the OAS report was found to be so deeply flawed as to be worthless in determining which candidates should proceed to a second round. The report ignored the problem of more than 150,000 missing votes that – given the voting patterns in the areas affected – would have shifted the result to Celestin. It also examined only a sample of the tally sheets, and did not use any statistical inference to estimate how the 92 percent of the tally sheets that it did not examine might have affected the result. The call for new elections began to grow. It was joined from the beginning by 12 presidential candidates who had competed in the deeply flawed first round, in which only about a quarter of Haitians voted. This was down from 59.3 percent in the previous presidential election, partly because the country’s most popular political party – Fanmi Lavalas – was excluded from participating in the election. Preval himself has been reported in the press to support new elections. Then yesterday the Congressional Black Caucus leaders, in their first break with the foreign policy of the Obama Administration, issued a statement that they called a “response to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s support of the OAS report”: “The CBC urges the United States and the international community to uphold the ideals of fairness and support a new Haiti election process that is free and fair, respecting the rights of the Haitian people.” But it is the rights of the Haitian people that Washington does not want to respect. Another reason that very likely contributed to Hillary Clinton’s sudden trip to Haiti on Sunday was that the Haitian government decided it is willing to issue a diplomatic passport to former President Aristide, who has been kept in exile in South Africa since the U.S.-organized coup ousted him in 2004. Recent Wikileaks cables show that the United States has pressed hard to keep him out of Haiti, and to keep him from exerting any influence from abroad. And his party, Fanmi Lavalas, was banned from participating in the November elections, as in other elections since he was removed from the country on a U.S. plane in 2004. Aristide issued a statement on Jan. 19  saying that he was ready to come home. It may seem strange that U.S. officials care so much about controlling a government as poor and without influence as Haiti, but they clearly do, having organized the overthrow of the country’s elected president in 2004, and contributed to the coup and subsequent death squads when Aristide was overthrown the first time in 1991. The amazing thing about the last two months is that they are meeting such resistance from within Haiti, and from the Congressional Black Caucus – which forced then President Bill Clinton to restore Aristide to the presidency in 1994. Signs of further international support for democracy in Haiti were shown on Jan. 26, when the OAS resolution on Haiti failed to endorse the recommendations of its own Mission’s report – due to resistance from left governments in Latin America. And the Rio Group, which includes 23 nations encompassing almost all of Latin America and the Caribbean, was also blocked by left governments from passing a resolution on Haiti. The government of Haiti is scheduled to announce its decision on the elections today, and it may well fold under the enormous pressure from Washington. But with Aristide’s return imminent, the battle is far from over. It is not only Egyptians that want free and fair elections, and not only the Arab world that is resisting U.S.-backed tyranny.

A government official told the AFP news agency the diplomatic passport had been issued on Monday. However, one of Mr Aristide's lawyers said he had not received it. Mr Aristide was ousted seven years ago and has been living in exile in South Africa, but has said he wants to return to Haiti. The news comes at a critical time for Haiti, with continuing uncertainty over the presidential election, due to go into a second round in March. Imminent return? A government official, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Agence France-Presse news agency the passport had been issued on Monday. "All the formalities have been completed," the official was quoted as saying. But Ira Kurzban, the lawyer who has been representing Mr Aristide, told AFP he had neither received the passport, nor had the Haitian authorities told him they had issued it. Haitian officials announced on 31 January they were ready to issue the passport, if Mr Aristide requested it. Mr Aristide has repeatedly expressed his wish to return to Haiti. The former Catholic priest was the first democratically elected president of Haiti. He first came to power in 1990, but was ousted only months later in a coup led by Brigadier-General Raoul Cedras. He returned to Haiti in 1994 after the military regime relinquished power in the face of an imminent US invasion. He served his term until 1996. He was re-elected in 2000 but was forced out of power again early in 2004, after several months of increasing political turmoil. Analysts say he still commands a sizeable group of supporters. Mr Aristide's party, Fanmi Lavalas, was barred from standing in the current election, allegedly due to technical errors in its application forms Street protests Reports of the government issuing him with a passport come at a critical time, with more than 100 people protesting in the capital, Port-au-Prince, on Monday. Protesters demanding that President Rene Preval leave office immediately clashed with police The protesters demanded that the outgoing President, Rene Preval, step down immediately. Mr Preval's term was due to end on Monday, but with the second round of the presidential election delayed until the end of March, the president announced he would stay in office for an additional three months. Police dispersed the demonstrators by firing teargas and shooting into the air. Last week, election officials ruled that the second and deciding round of Haiti's presidential election would be contended by the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat and popular singer Michel Martelly, edging out the government backed candidate Jude Celestin. The first round, which international monitors said was rigged in favour of Mr Celestin, triggered wide-spread protests. The second round was supposed to take place last month, but was postponed because of the dispute between supporters of Mr Celestin, who according to preliminary results came second, and Mr Martelly's supporters, whose candidate came third. Mr Preval's chief of staff confirmed on Monday that President Preval would stay in office until 14 May 2011, for which he already had parliamentary approval.

A Haitian holds a photo of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide during a demonstration in Port-au-Prince  Photo: AFP/GETTY 11:57PM GMT 07 Feb 2011 "The passport was issued on Monday. All the formalities have been completed," the official said, asking to remain anonymous, adding the document had been handed over to one of Mr Aristide's lawyers, Ira Kurzban. Mr Kurzban, who is based in Miami, arrived in recent days in Haiti to take possession of the passport, the official added. The news, certain to add to the uncertainty in this quake-hit nation, came as about 200 people demonstrated in the capital Port-au-Prince calling for President Rene Preval to step down. "Preval, give back the keys to the palace, your mission is at an end," they shouted, at the demonstration held in front of the presidential palace, still in ruins after the January 2010 earth quake. Mr Preval had been due to step down from office on Monday, but the presidential elections have been bogged down by accusations of corruption and vote-rigging in favour of his favoured successor. Related Articles Exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide offers to return 15 Jan 2010 The Haiti election commission ruled on Thursday that popular singer Michel Martelly – and not the ruling party's Jude Celestin – would now face off against former first lady Mirlande Manigat in the second round on March 20. It is not yet clear how Mr Aristide's return – coming so soon after former dictator Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier ended two decades in exile – will impact on the political scene. Mr Aristide has been living in South Africa since 2004, and in recent months has repeatedly requested to be allowed to return home to the Caribbean nation, but said he had no travel documents as his passport had expired. Haiti's first democratically elected leader who was forced to flee amid a popular revolt after two stints as president, Mr Aristide has said he wants to return to help his countrymen.   Haiti News » World News » Central America and the Caribbean » In Haiti   Tropical storm Isaac   Haiti, two years after the earthquake   Hurricane Irene hits the US   Hurricane Irene in pictures   Pulitzer photography prize   Read more World News Previously uncontacted Peruvian Indians 'could carry flu back to tribe'   Activists fear that virus contracted by Amazonian tribe members fleeing violent attacks could spread through vulnerable and isolated communities Islamic State uses high grade captured weapons to fight Assad troops in Syria   The extremist group is benefiting from huge caches of arms it seized after overrunning parts of Northern Iraq Wikipedia bans editing of its pages by Congressional staffers after ‘online vandalism’   The internet encyclopaedia announces ban in response to “persistent disruptive editing” – such as describing Donald Rumsfeld as a “alien lizard” – by anonymous users in House of Representatives Nigeria confirms Liberian man died of Ebola in Lagos   Ebola caused the death of a Liberian national who died in quarantine in Lagos, Nigeria confirms Benedict Cumberbatch greets Comic-Con fans   Video Benedict Cumberbatch to Megan Fox meet fans and promote their latest films Penguins of Madagascar and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the massive pop culture expo Comic-Con, in San Diego Young woman allegedly posts picture using mascara looted from crash site   Yekaterina Parkhomenko uploaded a photograph with the caption: 'Mascara from Amsterdam; to be precise, from the field.
