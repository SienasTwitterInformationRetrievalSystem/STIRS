Prime Minister Netanyahu and Prime Minister Erdogan deserve great credit for showing the leadership necessary to make this possible. As I discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu this evening, this will help Israel meet the many challenges it faces in the region. We look forward to an expeditious implementation of the agreement and the full normalization of relations so Israel and Turkey can work together to advance their common interests.

US President Obama sits with Jordanian King in Amman, March 22, 2013. Photo: REUTERS/Jason Reed "I have long said that it is in the interest of Israel and Turkey to restore normal relations between two countries that have historically had good ties," US President Barack Obama said on Friday. In a joint press conference with Jordanian King Abdullah II in Amman, Obama said that during his visit in Israel, it appeared that the timing was good for brokering reconciliation between Israel and Turkey, and that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu "agreed the 'moment was right' for reconciliation." Related: Netanyahu apologizes to Turkey over Gaza flotilla Liberman labels Turkey apology 'serious mistake' Obama added that the reconciliation is still a work in progress that is "just beginning." "There will still be significant disagreements, not just on the Palestinian question but on a range of different issues," Obama stated, but added that the two countries have a "shared interest and have been extraordinarily strong partners in the past." Meanwhile, The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) congratulated Netanyahu on Friday for the phone call between him and Prime Minister Recep Erdogan of Turkey, in which he apologized for a 2010 incident involving a Turkish Gaza-bound flotilla. ADL National Director Abe Foxman applauded the "restoration of relations" between two of "America's most reliable allies in the region," and thanked US President Barack Obama for his "direct facilitation" of the reconciliation, during his visit to Israel. "The long friendship and mutual cooperation between Israel and Turkey has been beneficial for both countries and an important model for partnership between Muslim nations in the region and Israel," added Foxman. Obama also addressed the potential reopening of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine on Friday in Amman, saying the "window of opportunity still exists, but is getting more and more difficult." Obama stated that during his trip to Israel and the West Bank he sought to listen first, "to find the road-blocks against progress." Only then, he stated, can the US discuss with the relevant parties how to remove the roadblocks and achieve concrete results. He said the US cannot guarantee peace, only that they will strive to make the effort towards it. "Peace will not be achieved until the parties themselves want peace. All of us share this frustration," Obama stated. "Israeli people are frustrated that this problem is not solved, they don't enjoy the isolation. The Palestinian people certainly feel this frustration, as young people grow up unable to do basic things that free people should do, simple things, like travel, or privacy in their own homes." "Part of the tragedy is that neither side can get what they want, but it's impossible to break out of the patterns of a difficult history," he said. Obama said he hoped that after his three-day trip, the US can explore mechanisms to sit down together and explore new methods. "If it gets done in a timely way, the Israeli people will be safer, and the Palestinians will be freer. As a consequence, the whole region will be strengthened and the world will be safer," Obama stated. In response, Jordanian King Abdullah II said that "Jordan's role as facilitator to bring Israelis and Palestinians closer together may help to have a framework for peace in next weeks or months." The king said that Jordan will host and provide support for both the Israelis and Palestinians in the run up to potential peace negotiations. "The window of opportunity is still open to re-galvanize effort" for peace, the king stated. Commenting on the Syria crisis, for which is said to be top of the agenda during the meeting between the king and president, Obama said that Assad has "lost all legitimacy," and that his fall was not a question of "if, but when.""Something has been broken in Syria, and it won't be put back together perfectly immediately, even after Assad," Obama said. Obama pledged to give $200 million to Jordan in aid of the crisis. Abdullah responded to say he would refuse to close Jordan's borders to Syrian refugees. "We haven't led with words, but with deeds," Obama said. "We have worked diligently to help organize and mobilize political opposition. This is critical; in it's absence, it would be impossible to transition to a legitimate government," he said.

Israel-Turkey reconciliation: PM 'expresses apology'  - Israel News, Ynetnews   Ynetnews >  News ynetnews web     Breaking News  ▪   Magazine  ▪   Mideast News  ▪   Syria Crisis  ▪   World News Burying Hatchet Erdogan accepts PM's apology Photo: Reuters   Obama waves goodbye as news of reconciliation breaks Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg     Israel-Turkey reconciliation: PM 'expresses apology' As US President Obama takes off to Jordan, reports are confirmed that Netanyahu called to apologize for deaths in Marmara raid; Erdogan agrees to normalize relations; Former FM Lieberman: Apology 'serious mistake' Attila Somfavli Published:  03.22.13, 17:25 / Israel News Tweet At the end of US President's visit to Israel, reports emerge that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and 'expressed apology' to the Turkish people for any error that could have led to the loss of life in the Marmara flotilla incident.  In response Erdogan accepted the apology and agreed that there is a need to normalize relations. The reports were affiliated to a US official and they also claim Israel has agreed to compensate the victims' families.   Related stories: Turkey to try top IDF officers over Marmara raid Erdogan: Zionism is crime against humanity EU parliamentarians seek public condemnation of Erdogan   In what can be called the first direct result of US President Barack Obama's visit, minutes after his departure, news of a US orchestrated reconciliation between Israel and Turkey breaks.   Reuters reported that Israel apologized to Turkey on Friday for killing nine Turkish citizens in a 2010 naval raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla leading Israel and Turkey, both US allies, to agree to normalize relations.   Erdogan accepts apology (Photo: EPA)   The rapprochement could help regional coordination to contain spillover from the Syrian civil war and ease Israel's diplomatic isolation in the Middle East as it faces challenges posed by Iran's nuclear program.   In response, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan underlined the importance of strong cooperation and friendship between the Turkish and Jewish nations in a telephone conversation with his Israeli counterpart on Friday, his office said.   2010 Marmara incident (Photo: IDF)   "Erdogan told (Israeli premier) Benjamin Netanyahu that he valued centuries-long strong friendship and cooperation between the Turkish and Jewish nations," the statement from Erdogan's office said.   Meanwhile, A senior Israeli political official confirmed that a conversation between Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu and his Turkish counterpart Erdogan did indeed place, at Ben Gurion Airport in the presence of US President Barack Obama.   According to the source "Netanyahu belived it is important to make such a call in light of the developing situation in Syria.   Meanwhile, former Foreign Minster, MK Avigdor Lieberman said that Israel's apologizing for the actions of IDF soldiers against terrorist agents is a serious mistake.   Lieberman was Israel's Foreign Minister at the time of the Mavi Marmara incent in 2010, and according to him: "Anyone who has seen the pictures from the Marmara understands without a shadow of a doubt that the actions of the IDF soldiers were self-defense."   However, Opposition Leader Shelly Yachimovich praised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to reconcile with his Turkish counterpart Erdogan. According to her: "It is best to swallow one's pride and do what is smart and beneficiary for the country."   Yachimovich added that "we should hope that the reconciliation is the first step towards a new policy, strengthening Israel's diplomatic and strategic standing."     As Obama takes off In a statement released by the White House only minutes before Obama ended a visit to Israel, the president said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erodgan had spoken by telephone.   "The United States deeply values our close partnerships with both Turkey and Israel, and we attach great importance to the restoration of positive relations between them in order to advance regional peace and security," Obama said.   The first conversation between the two leaders since 2011, when Netanyahu phoned to offer help after an earthquake struck Turkey, gave Obama a diplomatic triumph in a visit to Israel and the Palestinian Territories in which he offered no new plan to revive peace talks frozen for nearly three years.   Turkish papers report reconciliation   The 30-minute call was made in a runway trailer at Tel Aviv airport, where Obama and Netanyahu huddled before the president boarded Air Force One for a flight to Jordan, US officials said.   Israel bowed to a long-standing demand by Ankara, once a close strategic partner, to apologize formally for the deaths aboard the Turkish vessel Mavi Marmara, which was boarded by Israeli marines who intercepted a flotilla challenging Israel's naval blockade of the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip.   Mavi Marmara docked in Ashdod port (Photo: Avi Rokah)   "Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed an apology to the Turkish people for any error that may have led to the loss of life, and agreed to complete the agreement for compensation," an official Israeli statement said.   Netanyahu and Erdogan "agreed to restore normalization between the two countries, including returning their ambassadors (to their posts)," the statement added.   A US official said "Erdogan accepted the apology on behalf of Turkey."   Bad blood Ankara expelled Israel's ambassador and froze military cooperation after a UN report into the Mavi Marmara incident, released in September 2011, largely exonerated Israel.   Israel had previously balked at apologizing to the Turks, saying this would be tantamount to admitting moral culpability and would invite lawsuits against its troops.   Voicing until now only "regret" over the Mavi Marmara incident, Israel has offered to pay into what it called a "humanitarian fund" through which casualties and their relatives could be compensated.   A source in Netanyahu's office said opening a new chapter with Turkey "can be very, very important for the future, regarding what happens with Syria but not just what happens with Syria".   Before the diplomatic break, Israeli pilots trained in Turkish skies, exercises widely seen as improving their capability to carry out long-range missions such as possible strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.   Reuters also contributed to this report   Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter   Receive Ynetnews updates directly to your desktop     Tweet comment    Print    Send to friend     Bookmark to del.icio.us   154 Talkbacks for this article     See all talkbacks Please wait for the talkbacks to load    RSS | About | Contact Us | Privacy Policy | Terms of use | Advertise with us | Site Map Site developed by   Copyright © Yedioth Internet.

Read More Close Open Photographer: Mustafa Ozer/ AFP via Getty Images Visitors enter the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara in Istanbul's Sarayburnu port, on Dec. 29, 2010. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the deaths of nine Turks on the aid flotilla to Gaza in 2010. Israel and Turkey took steps to restore ties nearly three years after the deaths of nine Turks on an aid flotilla to the Gaza Strip as the U.S. sought to bolster an allied front in an increasingly unstable Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized yesterday to Turkey for the deaths in a phone call with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to the Israeli premier’s office and officials traveling in Israel with President Barack Obama, who brokered the thaw between the two U.S. allies. Netanyahu “expressed Israel’s apology to the Turkish people for any mistakes that might have led to the loss of life or injury” aboard the aid ship raided by Israeli commandos in May 2010, his office said in a text message. The countries agreed to work on compensation and a non- liability accord, a reference to Turkish legal action against Israeli soldiers, the message said. Erdogan’s office confirmed those discussions in an e-mailed statement. An Israeli official also said the countries have agreed to restore diplomatic ties by reinstating their ambassadors, which wasn’t confirmed in the Turkish statement. The Turkish-Israeli alliance, based on security ties stretching back decades, has been under strain in recent years. The flotilla incident exacerbated tensions caused by Erdogan’s repeated criticism of Israeli policy, especially the Gaza incursion of 2008. More recently there have been signs of overlap in the countries’ regional interests. Both are calling for the departure of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and Turkey has distanced itself from Israel’s chief enemy, Iran. Surprise Rapprochement The rapprochement is a surprise, and a “significant” step toward improved relations between Turkey and Israel, said Kemal Kirisci, head of the Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “It came, literally, out of the blue,” for analysts who follow Turkish-Israeli relations, he said in an interview. It’s “a fascinating, spur-of-the-moment production on the part of Obama, and a little credit would go his way.” Turkish financial markets reversed losses after the announcement of the Netanyahu-Erdogan phone call. The benchmark stock index closed up 0.1 percent, after falling as much as 0.6 percent earlier today. The lira gained 0.2 percent against the dollar, while Israel’s shekel added 0.4 percent to 3.65 per dollar at 5:50 p.m. in Tel Aviv. Good News “The ties are positive,” Guillaume Salomon, chief emerging-markets strategist at Societe Generale SA in London, said by phone. “Any ties that bring Israel closer to some of its neighbors is good news.” Obama said the “moment was right” for the attempt to repair the relationship, and there is more to be done. “This is just beginning,” Obama said at a news conference with Jordan’s King Abdullah II in Amman, the final stop on the U.S. president’s trip to the region. Cliff May, president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a non-partisan policy institution in Washington, said hurdles remain to a fuller restoration of the relations. “It’s positive, but count me pessimistic that it restores the Turkish-Israelis alliance,” he said in an interview. The apologetic telephone call, May said, was something Obama “wanted for good reason, and that Netanyahu was willing to concede.” Turkey is a member of NATO, and Israel is the most reliable ally in the Mideast. Increasing tension between the two is awkward for Obama and someone had to move. Erdogan’s response was “reasonably gracious,” May said. Islamic Leadership Even so, there remain a set of historical and structural difficulties between the two U.S. allies. Erdogan “sees Turkey in a leadership role in the Islamic world,” May said. “You cannot have very cordial relationships if you aspire to lead the Islamic world in 2013.” Erdogan, a politician with Islamist roots, accused Israel of “state terrorism” in Gaza and walked out of a discussion with Israeli President Shimon Peres in Davos in 2009. His anti- Israel stance has won him kudos with the public in Turkey, where there is strong sympathy with Palestinians, and across the region. Erdogan was welcomed as a hero when he visited Egypt and other Arab countries after the revolutions of 2011. Erdogan has made statements equating Zionism with fascism, according to May. “Somebody says Zionism is fascism, or Zionism is racism, they are saying Israel doesn’t have a right to exist,” he said. Restoring Trust If Netanyahu believes that’s Erdogan’s true conviction, apologies may not matter and trust might not be restored to any meaningful degree, May said. Turkey broke off diplomatic ties after the flotilla attack, and in November last year it put four former Israeli officers, including ex-chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi, on trial in absentia for the killings. Israel said the aid ship ignored a warning to turn aside and that activists attacked soldiers who boarded in order to stop it from breaching the blockade of Gaza. As diplomatic ties worsened, the two countries have kept business channels open and trade has flourished. It reached a record $4.4 billion in 2011, according to official Turkish figures, and stayed near that level last year. Tourism, though, has slumped as Israelis shun Turkey, once a favorite destination. Visitor numbers have fallen more than 80 percent since 2009, according to the Israeli Embassy in Ankara. Syria Dispute The U.S. is seeking to unite its regional allies in applying pressure on Iran to halt its nuclear program. Both the U.S. and Israel have warned they may use military strikes to achieve that goal if diplomacy doesn’t work. Turkey, which enjoyed improved relations with the Islamic Republic during most of Erdogan’s decade in power, has disagreed with its neighbor over Syria as the region increasingly divides along sectarian lines. Shiite Muslim-ruled Iran supports Assad, whose Alawite sect is affiliated with Shiite Islam. Turkey is aligned with the U.S. and its main Sunni ally in the region, Saudi Arabia, in backing the rebels fighting to oust Assad.

March 22, 2013 | By Edmund Sanders and Christi Parsons, Los Angeles Times President Obama listens to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu… (Pablo Martinez Monsivais,…) JERUSALEM — President Obama brokered a diplomatic reconciliation between key Middle East allies Israel and Turkey at the end of his visit to the Holy Land, thawing tensions that have complicated U.S. efforts to cope with regional issues including Syria's civil war. With Obama looking on, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formally apologized Friday to Turkey over the 2010 killing by Israeli soldiers of nine Turkish activists aboard a Gaza Strip-bound protest ship, U.S. and Israeli officials said. The apology, made during a 30-minute telephone call to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, clears the way for the restoration of normal relations between the two countries. The U.S.-brokered apology added some last-minute diplomatic heft to the first foreign trip of Obama's second term. Though his speech Thursday to Israeli university students was generally well-received, it avoided the difficult details involved in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry remains in the region. Israeli officials said serious talks were underway about reviving peace talks, but no agreement was imminent. U.S. officials had been trying to negotiate a rapprochement between Israel and Turkey for two years, emphasizing that they should be working together to address regional threats, particularly the 2-year-old conflict in Syria. Unconfirmed reports that chemical weapons were used in Syria this week heightened the sense of urgency to mend ties with Turkey, Israeli officials said. An end to the Israel-Turkey spat will make it easier for the U.S. to coordinate a regional response to the conflict, which has sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming out of Syria. In addition to fears of Syria's alleged chemical weapons stockpiles, the U.S. and many of Syria's neighbors worry about the country becoming a failed state that could provide a safe haven to Islamic militant groups. Speaking of the two U.S. allies as he left Israel, Obama said: "We attach great importance to the restoration of positive relations between them in order to advance regional peace and security." Israel had resisted U.S. pressure to apologize, saying passengers aboard the Mavi Marmara flotilla were responsible for their own deaths because they violently resisted Israeli commandos as the soldiers seized the ship in international waters. The boat was carrying international activists attempting to break Israel's naval blockade around Gaza. Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador in retaliation and cut military ties. Erdogan had vowed not to normalize relations until Israel apologized and compensated the families of those killed. During the telephone conversation, which took place in a trailer at the airport, Netanyahu acknowledged "operational mistakes" and Erdogan accepted the apology, a U.S. official said. Israeli officials said they promised to pay compensation to the families of the activists. In return, Turkey will drop its lawsuits against the soldiers. The two countries agreed to normalize relations, including reinstating ambassadors. But there are other reasons why the relationship may remain tense. Erdogan last month compared Zionism to anti-Semitism and fascism, calling it a crime against humanity. He said this week that his comments had been misinterpreted. Former Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who blocked a previous U.S.-brokered reconciliation with Turkey, criticized Netanyahu on Friday, saying the apology would make Israel appear weak in the region. Others in Israel have argued that Turkey, which had been distancing itself from Israel over the West Bank occupation and Gaza border blockade, will just find another reason to break ties. Robert Danin, a former diplomat and an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Netanyahu's apology was a gesture of goodwill toward Obama as well as Turkey. "I think the Israelis wanted to have the president leave with a tangible diplomatic achievement, and that was it," he said. While both Obama and Netanyahu made a point of getting along in public, experts said they doubted there would be immediate progress in improving U.S.-Israeli relations. On the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Obama administration officials said they had come primarily to listen. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said, "We're at the pre-breakthrough stage." "We set expectations low precisely because there has been a lot of talk over the decades but it hasn't produced the result everyone wants to see," Obama said Friday night. "What I can guarantee is that we'll make the effort.... We're just going to keep on plugging away." 1 | 2 | Next FEATURED Death of Scott Sterling, son of Clippers owner, ruled accidental The frequent fliers who flew too much How not to say the wrong thing MORE: Mayor feels a `sense of failure' in marital split Seizure Led to FloJo's Death His 104 scores make his case Brutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons' Shock Advertisement &lt;a href=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=339767&amp;cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=339767&amp;cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; FROM THE ARCHIVES Obama brokers Israeli apology for Turkish activists' deaths March 22, 2013 Turkey expels Israel's ambassador, suspends military...

Netanyahu even agreed to offer compensation to the families of the victims and agreed to the Turkish demand for lifting the military siege on Gaza and easing restriction on the flow of aid into Gaza, thus agreeing to all three preconditions laid out by Turkey for any reconciliation. Suddenly, everything about Obama’s first visit to Israel was forgotten, the prospects of Israel-Palestine peace talks put on the back burner for the moment and even the threat of Iran’s nuclear weapons programme has been relegated to the future. Obama had indeed pulled a rabbit out of the hat and accomplished something that had eluded the region for three years; rapprochement and reconciliation between two important regional powers both of which are critical US allies. As the region, the two nations and the people grapple with the new emerging situation, this latest development throws up critical questions: How and why did Netanyahu agree to apologize despite his strong stance on the issue for almost three years? What was the US role and interest in the development? How is Turkey likely to perceive the development and take its ties further with Israel? Israeli Compulsions “In light of Israel’s investigation into the incident which pointed to a number of operational mistakes, the prime minister expressed Israel’s apology to the Turkish people for any mistakes that might have led to the loss of life or injury and agreed to conclude an agreement on compensation/non liability,” the statement from Netanyahu’s office read. “Prime Minister Netanyahu also noted that Israel had substantially lifted the restrictions on the entry of civilian goods into the Palestinian territories, including Gaza, and that this would continue as long as calm prevailed.”1 Why now? "We could have made this apology a while ago, but then, more than they wanted an apology, Turkey wanted to humiliate Israel and hurt its international standing. Now, backed with the US initiative, it was possible to reach a compromise without anybody losing face," said Danny Ayalon, former Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister, reacting to the apology.2 The US may have provided the support and platform for the apology, but it was something Israel had to do desperately as it was finding the developing regional situation difficult to handle with every passing day. In a region surrounded by adversaries, the last two years have not been exactly what Israel would have hoped for. The ‘Arab Spring’ had caught the region by surprise and Israel was definitely caught on the wrong side of developments. Having broken off with Turkey just a few months earlier in May 2010, the fall of President Mubarak in February 2011, the outbreak of the Syrian crisis in March 2011 and the brief Gaza operations “Operation Pillar of Defence”3 in November 2012, all isolated Israel like never before in the recent past. Israel found itself surrounded by new regimes which were not ready to guarantee the continuance of the fragile peace in the region. Egypt under the Muslim Brotherhood President Morsi worried Israel about the prospects of continuation of their bilateral peace treaty. The Sinai desert had slowly developed into an area of security concern and was serving as a conduit for arms supplies to the Hamas in the Gaza strip, forcing Israel to construct a 240 kilometre steel fence across it. Hamas was emboldened by international support during Operation Pillar of Defence. Syria under Assad had ensured peace along the border with Israel, but with the Assad regime under threat this frontier too became unstable. Jordan, itself under the influence of ‘Arab Spring’, threatened to go the way of the Islamists, although King Abdullah has been successful in containing the situation for now. To add to Israeli woes, the relationship with the US came under tremendous strain over the Palestine issue as well as the Iran nuclear issue. While Israel publicly propagated military action against Iran, the US wanted to give diplomacy a chance. In such an unfavourable environment, Israel desperately needed to get back its only ally in the region; Turkey. There was a strong realization of this imperative in Israel; all that it was perhaps looking for was a face saver. US Role and Interests "The United States deeply values our close partnerships with both Turkey and Israel, and we attach great importance to the restoration of positive relations between them in order to advance regional peace and security," said Obama.4 If there was anyone who wanted this Israel-Turkey reconciliation to happen, and happen at the earliest, it was definitely the US. Stung by the new realignments post the ‘Arab Spring’ and the compulsions to look beyond the Middle East as dictated by its ‘Asia pivot’, the US could not have left the regional situation adrift. Egypt was trying to chart its own independent course; Turkey and Israel were estranged allies; and there was no tangible progress on the Iran nuclear issue. Most importantly, the Syrian crisis threatened to spiral totally out of control. Post Iraq and Afghanistan, the US does not want to get itself involved militarily in regional disputes. In order to achieve this, it requires able and trusted regional allies who could shoulder the military burden as and when required, while the US provides material and technological support. In such a situation, the US requires Israel and Turkey to be on the same side. Perhaps this, along with concern over the situation in Syria, was what led Obama to urge Israel to reach out to Turkey. Allegations over the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war had prompted Obama to repeat his “red line” concerning any use of chemical weapons and to declare that such use would be a “game changer” for the US in its approach to the conflict.5 Thus, the US as well as NATO needed Turkey and Israel to forge a regional alliance for ousting Assad from power. Turkey’s Gains In the process, Turkey has been the definite winner. It made Israel bow to its demand that too through US mediation. Coming on the back of possible reconciliation with the Kurds, this would count as a good phase in Turkey’s foreign policy. On 21 March, PKK leader, Abbdullah Ojalan, leader announced a ceasefire and the very next day came the long awaited apology from Israel. Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoğlu said: “When Kerry (US Secretary of State) visited Turkey we talked about these matters very openly. We voiced our three demands [apology, compensation and lifting of the Gaza blockade] if Turkey's contribution to the peace process in the Middle East and the normalization of ties with Israel was wanted… We agreed that Netanyahu would call the Turkish prime minister accompanied by President Obama. Each word of the agreement has been studied.”6 Davutoğlu also said that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called both the Hamas prime minister of Gaza and the leader of the Palestinian Authority to get their approval before accepting Israel's formal apology for the Mavi Marmara raid. He added that Erdoğan also called Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. The confirmation from the Turkish Prime Minister’s Office read: "Erdogan told (Israeli premier) Benjamin Netanyahu that he valued the centuries-long strong friendship and cooperation between the Turkish and Jewish nations.” These developments clearly demonstrate how deliberately and shrewdly Turkey got what it wanted. It has given a much required boost to Turkey’s stature in the region as well as in the Arab world where it would be seen how Turkey had made Israel bow down to pressure. Already championing itself as a role model of governance and democracy to the new evolving regimes in the region, this would give the just required fillip for Turkey’s quest for leadership role in the region. Importantly, the trigger for the reconciliation – the Syrian crisis – required both Turkey and Israel to be on the same side. Both, Israel and Turkey had grown increasingly concerned about events in Syria; Turkey in confronting an ever-growing Syrian refugee population and Israel with the increasing presence of Islamist extremists from around the region, especially along the Golan Heights and the Lebanese border. Added to that was the fear of chemical weapons being used in Syria and their residual effect into their countries as also the fear of the Syrian arsenal of chemical weapons falling in the hands of Hezbollah and other militant groups. Looking Ahead “Turkey accomplished making Israel bow down," read a written Hamas statement adding that “Turkey made Israel accepts its rightly demands. It reveals the Zionist enemy does not understand anything besides a firm standing or the language of resistance.”7 This statement clearly reflected the triumphant emotions on Israel’s apology in the neighbourhood and could translate into a greater role for Turkey in the region. It remains to be seen how Turkey reacts to the rapprochement. It is unlikely that the relationship would reach the levels of cooperation seen earlier. After all, it was the breaking off with Israel that provided Turkey with an opportunity to reach out to the Arab world. Whether Turkey will now soften its rhetoric against Israel and revisit its role as a key interlocutor between Israel and the Arabs as also the Palestinians, only time will tell. However, Erdogan and his team have proven how important Turkey remains to the region, especially as a US and NATO ally. For the time being at least, Turkey appears triumphant, the US elated and Israel clearly relieved.
