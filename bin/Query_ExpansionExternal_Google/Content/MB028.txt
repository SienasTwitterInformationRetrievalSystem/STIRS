Upload Toyota Vision Wall at 2011 Detroit Auto Show from PUSH Offices Plus 3 years ago Not Yet Rated Named "Belle of the Ball" at the 2011 Detroit Auto Show, the Toyota Vision Wall is a large-format interactive installation leveraging a great deal of UX intelligence and bleeding edge technology. Our team at PUSH collaborated in concepting and UX, and led development of the application. The result: a beautiful, highly interactive display application that amazed and amused everyone from playful children to Mr. Toyota himself. The project was a collaboration with GPJ (experience marketers), Juxt Interactive (lead agency) and Hush (motion graphics).

Crain's Detroit Business reports that the 2011 Detroit Auto Show held 5,000 members of the international media during press days and 21,000 guests (5,000 more than in 2010) during the two-day industry preview. The annual charity preview saw another 10,500 guests, raising $2.6 million for charity. That's good news, but the top headlines for the struggling Detroit area are reserved for the $325 to $350 million in total estimated economic impact – about $25 million more than in 2010. A grand total of 735,370 members of the general public purchased tickets to NAIAS; up 20,000 from the 2010 show. Now that's certainly a step in the right direction.

Read All Report Reply Anonymous 3 Years Ago I'd have gone if I weren't just laid off and lived 10 hours away. =( Read All Report Reply Anonymous 3 Years Ago Well, we'll always have Chicago! I just want to go to the "big show" once, Cobo Hall's ghettoness or not. Read All Report Reply Anonymous 3 Years Ago I live 7-9 (depending on speeding and whatnot ;D) and went. But I wasn't really impressed with the show, honestly. Nor Cobo. Actually, the thing that struck me as the most interesting part of my trip was the city itself. Read All Report Reply Anonymous 3 Years Ago I have to agree with Aprime. Detroit itself is always interesting to see. I was surprised to see signs of life and improvement in Downtown D. The Autoshow on the other hand was a let down. The Cobo Center get's more frightening every year. Customer Service has also hit an all time low. The staff don't even go outside to smoke anymore they just sneak behind the curtain in the corner. We drive 4 hours and have to deal with "Homeland Insecurity" to get there so we plan for a full day. They advertised that the show was open until 10pm but BYD turned their lights off and walked out at 8pm. Others were not far behind. Even the Living Green Expo was closed before 9pm and security stopped giving out hand stamps and letting you go in and out of the show floor. Even with the Canadian dollar being worth more than the American we were glad to have bought Yankee bucks ahead because everyone was trying to rip us off on the exchange (even the Bridge toll booths!). Of course the biggest issue at the Autoshow is always actually getting into the vehicles you want to check out. Porsche had most of their cars locked so their booth was almost pointless. It seemed like every booth had a few locked cars (and not just concepts). Making it harder to find one you can actually sit in and check finishes. Most of the time we didn't have to wait to long but there was the occasional family having a picnic or idiot who decided the front seat was a more comfortable place to rest than the benches. The other disappointment was the number of brands that are still skipping the Detroit show. I keep promising myself that this will be my last trip to the Detroit show but I think this year I may actually keep that promise. Read All Report Reply Anonymous 3 Years Ago I went by CN rail, and 5 hours later arrive at Cobo Hall to see an uninspired auto show. Sadly, no comparison to the shows in the 90's. Read All Report Reply Anonymous 3 Years Ago But you can't compare this auto show with NAIAS of the 90's. The auto makers are being considerably more conservative with their cash flow, and aren't coming out with the flashy concept cars they know aren't even going to be considered for production. Plus, compared to the 90's, there are auto companies that either didn't attend or are out of business. No Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer, Mercury, Mitsubishi, Nissan/Infiniti, Rolls-Royce, Suzuki, or Lamborghini. Read All Report Reply Anonymous 3 Years Ago I went this year after taking 2 years off. I highly recommend parking in Greektown, a few blocks away, and taking the elevated tram over to COBO. This year it was running in a direction that takes you by the river on the way there, and is just a few minutes from the casinos and tasty gyros and baklava on the way back. As for the show. Not too bad, but definitely not very crowded compared to 4 or 5 years ago. Nothing in the lower level either. On the upside, some areas, like Ford, had an army of people out to talk to visitors, where in years past, it was usually just a few models roaming around. Don't get me wrong, love the ladies in the little dresses, but appreciated the effort to engage the visitors. Read All Report Reply Anonymous 3 Years Ago Went several times between media days, charity preview and public days, took tons of great photos and had a lot of fun with friends. Definitely a big improvement over last year's show! Though I wish they still had the 'exotic' cars at the actual show instead of shoving them off to the side at the casino.

According to final numbers released today by the event’s organizers, it was also attended by more people than in 2010. Visitors to the 2011 North American International Motor Show totaled some 735,370 people, marking a 3 percent rise over 2010’s result of 714,137 visitors. The single-day record for a Friday was also broken this year, as 75,327 people passed through the convention’s doors, beating the Friday record of 74,900 set in 1993. "The 2011 NAIAS validated all promises made by exhibitors in 2009 and 2010 as the product pipeline is full and vibrant. The ability to rise up from the difficult economic times of the recent past in glowing fashion indicates a positive ripple effect for our local, national and global economies,” Barron Meade, Chairman of the 2011 show, said in a statement. At least 5,000 international media from 60 countries (including the autoevolution team) covered the auto show during the press days. A total of 55 new products were unveiled, including the BMW 1-Series M Coupe, two Honda Civic Concepts and the Ford Focus EV. This year also saw Porsche returning to Detroit, while Nissan announced it will return in 2012. "NAIAS is again proud to kick off a new year by providing a global stage for so many to be spotlighted," Meade also stated. Southeast Michigan is estimated to have received a $350 million to $375 million boost to its economy from visitors, in the form of hotels, transportation, catering and entertainment.

I was rather disappointed that there was such a poor turnout by the auto manufacturers. Seems that MI's economic collapse is catching up with it. A single Ferrari and Maserati, no Lambo/Nissan/Lotus, etc. Perhaps next year I'll have to travel to the Chicago Auto Show (which I hear is getting much better).

And thank you (and smooth monkey) for the compliments on the shots. I sat on the floor by the Audi for over 20mins waiting for the crowd to stop touching the car and disperse a bit.
