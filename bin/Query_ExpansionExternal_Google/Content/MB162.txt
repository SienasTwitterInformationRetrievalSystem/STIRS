Later that morning, the DPRK announced that it had conducted a nuclear test. CTBTO Executive Secretary Tibor Tóth strongly condemned DPRK’s action as “a clear threat to international peace and security.” The event was registered by 94 seismic stations and two infrasound stations in the CTBTO’s network. The data processing and analysis are designed to weed out natural events and focus on those events that might be explosions, including nuclear explosions. Update 23 April: Two CTBTO radionuclide stations have detected radioactivity consistent with the 12 February DPRK event.

Share your views with CNN. (CNN) -- Reaction to North Korea's nuclear test -- its third since 2006 -- poured in Tuesday from around the world: Barack Obama, U.S. president: "This is a highly provocative act that ... undermines regional stability, violates North Korea's obligations under numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions, contravenes its commitments under the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, and increases the risk of proliferation. North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs constitute a threat to U.S. national security and to international peace and security. The United States remains vigilant in the face of North Korean provocations and steadfast in our defense commitments to allies in the region." For South Koreans, a familiar tone from Pyongyang Watch North Korea announce nuclear test Expert: N. Korea test 'not a surprise' China's role in Korean crisis "The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community. The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies." U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta "We're going to have to continue to deal with rogue states like Iran and North Korea. We just saw what North Korea's done in these last few weeks -- a missile test and now a nuclear test. They represent a serious threat to the United States of America and we've got to be prepared to deal with that." China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The Chinese government "resolutely opposes" North Korea's nuclear test, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a prepared statement. "Holding up peace and stability in Northeast Asia is China's resolute position," it said. "We strongly urge (North Korea) to abide by (its) promise to denuclearize and take no further action that will worsen the situation." Park Geun-hye, South Korean president-elect: "Despite the strong warning from the international community and South Korea, North Korea has conducted its third nuclear test, and we strongly condemn it." "The North Korean nuclear test is a serious threat to the peace of the Korean peninsula and the world, and it has hampered the credibility between the South and North." Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The Russian Federation condemned the test of the nuclear explosive but also called on other nations not to react with a show of military might. In a written statement, the foreign ministry said North Korea's actions are an affront to the community of nations. "It's doubly sad that we are talking about the state with which our country has a long history of good neighborliness," the ministry said. Russia called upon North Korea to stay away from a nuclear missile program, adhere to U.N. Security Council regulations and return to six-party talks. Then the foreign ministry directed a message to North Korea's adversaries: "We expect that the current action of Pyongyang will not be used as an excuse to increase military activities around the Korean Peninsula." Shinzo Abe, Japanese prime minister: What is a successful rocket launch? Kim Jong Un developing his legacy Nuclear test next step in arsenal? "North Korea's nuclear testing is a grave threat to the safety of Japan and a serious challenge against international disarmament framework based on the non-nuclear proliferation treaty. We can never tolerate it as it significantly compromise the peace and safety of Northeast Asia and the international society." "Japan firmly protests and sternly condemns the nuclear testing." READ: What happens with an underground nuclear test? Statement from the office of Ban Ki-moon, U.N. secretary-general: "The Secretary-General condemns the underground nuclear weapon test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today. It is a clear and grave violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is deplorable that Pyongyang defied the strong and unequivocal call from the international community to refrain from any further provocative measures. The Secretary-General had repeatedly called on the new leadership in Pyongyang to address international concerns and start building confidence with neighboring countries and the international community. The Secretary-General is gravely concerned about the negative impact of this deeply destabilizing act on regional stability as well as the global efforts for nuclear non-proliferation. He once again urges the DPRK to reverse course and work toward de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Young Kim looks to build his own legacy in North Korea The Secretary-General is confident that the Security Council will remain united and take appropriate action. In the meantime, the Secretary-General remains in close contact with all concerned parties and stands ready to assist their efforts." Yukiya Amano, International Atomic Energy Agency director general: "This is deeply regrettable and is in clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions." "The IAEA remains ready to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue by resuming its nuclear verification activities in the country as soon as the political agreement is reached among countries concerned." Statement from NATO: "We condemn in the strongest terms the test by North Korea of a nuclear weapon, conducted in flagrant violation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. This irresponsible act, along with the December missile launch, poses a grave threat to international and regional peace, security and stability. North Korea's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction represents continued defiance of the U.N. Security Council and the broader international community." READ: Five things to know about North Korea's planned nuclear test William Hague, British foreign secretary: "I strongly condemn this development, which is a violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874 and 2087. North Korea's development of its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities poses a threat to international and regional security. Its repeated provocations only serve to increase regional tension, and hinder the prospects for lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula." Francois Hollande, French president: "I condemn in the strongest terms the nuclear test just made by North Korea," Hollande said on the French government's website. "France again urges North Korea to immediately comply with its international obligations and to carry out complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear and missile programs." READ: North Korea's rocket-fueled obsession Statement from the German Foreign Office: Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle "strongly condemns" North Korea's nuclear test. The "international community should consider further sanctions against the regime," the agency's official Twitter feed said. Bob Carr, Australian foreign affairs minister: "The Australian government condemns in the strongest possible terms nuclear testing by North Korea. "Nuclear testing by North Korea clearly violates United Nations Security Council resolutions ... which demand North Korea not conduct any further nuclear tests. "North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and missiles and its proliferation of sensitive technologies threaten international peace and security." Journalist Connie Young in Beijing and CNN's Alla Eshchenko in Moscow contributed to this report.

SET EDITION:  U.S. INTERNATIONAL MÉXICO ARABIC TV:   CNN CNNi CNN en Español HLN Sign up Log in Home TV & Video U.S. World Politics Justice Entertainment Tech Health Living Travel Opinion iReport Money Sports SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Tough U.N. action vowed after North Korean nuclear test By Jethro Mullen, CNN updated 6:38 PM EST, Tue February 12, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: North Korea informed the United States of its intention to conduct a test Obama says the test was "highly provocative," calls for swift international action China says it "resolutely opposes" the nuclear test "Ill-advised pursuit" of WMDs has hurt North Korea, Ambassador Susan Rice says Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea's nuclear test prompted united condemnation and a vow of tough action from the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. The council issued a statement slamming the underground nuclear test that jolted the already fragile security situation in Northeast Asia. South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan, repeating a statement to reporters outside council chambers, said the test violated council resolutions, and "there continues to exist a clear threat to international peace and security." Kim said council members will start work "on appropriate measures in a Security Council resolution" and that "North Korea will be held responsible for any consequences of this provocative act." The council is chaired this month by South Korea. North Korea conducts new nuclear test What North Korea can actually do China's role in Korean crisis Kim Jong Un developing his legacy The Security Council last month promised "significant action" if another North Korean nuclear test occurred. The test probably took place near P'unggye and yielded "several kilotons," according to assessments cited by the U.S. director of national intelligence. It drew condemnation from around the globe and prompted the emergency Security Council session Tuesday morning. It is the first nuclear test carried out under the North's young leader, Kim Jong Un, who appears to be sticking closely to his father's policy of building up the isolated state's military deterrent to keep its foes at bay, shrugging off the resulting international condemnation and sanctions. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said North Korea told the department "through our usual channel" of its "intention to conduct a nuclear test without citing any specific timing prior to the event." After Kim Sung-hwan spoke, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters outside the council chambers that the panel met to discuss what she called a "provocative test" and an action that council members regard as "regrettable." The test violates North Korea's obligations under several unanimous council resolutions, she said. The council "must and will deliver a swift, credible and strong response" in a resolution to deal with Pyongyang's missile and weapons programs, she said. The goal, she said, is to tighten and augment measures, such as sanctions, against the country. North Korea "does not and will not benefit from violating international law," said Rice, who stressed that the country has "isolated and impoverished its people from its ill-advised pursuit" of weapons of mass destruction and weapons delivery systems. The council's actions make it clear that such actions are "not acceptable" and "will not be tolerated," she said. The permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China. For the past year, Nuland said, world leaders, including those in China, have signaled to North Korea that if they want to end their isolation and meet their people's needs, they can go down another road. But she said North Korea has spurned an "open door" and chose "one provocative action after another." "The question now, for all of us, is how we can get their attention," she said, adding that "it is fair to say that we are looking at the full suite of options to try to get the DPRK to try to change course." What happens with an underground nuclear test? ', { 'class': 'minimap', 'css': { 'position': 'absolute', 'border': '1px solid #888', 'width': 125, 'height': 60, 'top': 10, 'right': 10 } }).appendTo($mapCanvas); var minimap = new nokia.maps.map.Display($minimapContainer[0], { 'zoomLevel': 8 - 4, 'center': map.center }); map.set('observers', { 'center': _setOverview, 'zoomLevel': _setOverview }); jQuery.each([[41.302743531560104,129.06662839377913]], function() { minimap.objects.add(new nokia.maps.map.Marker([this[0], this[1]], { 'icon': 'http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/02/08/marker_small.png', 'anchor': new nokia.maps.util.Point(5.5, 18) })); }); }()); Although Pyongyang had announced plans for the test in recent, vitriolic statements, its decision to go ahead with it provided a stark reminder of a seemingly intractable foreign policy challenge for U.S. President Barack Obama ahead of his State of the Union address later Tuesday. The test was designed "to defend the country's security and sovereignty in the face of the ferocious hostile act of the U.S.," the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency said, referring to new U.S.-led sanctions on Pyongyang after the recent launch of a long-range rocket. "This nuclear test is our first measure, which displayed our maximum restraint," KCNA said. "If the U.S. continues with their hostility and complicates the situation, it would be inevitable to continuously conduct a stronger second or third measure." Why is North Korea obsessed with rockets? Tuesday's nuclear test had greater explosive force and involved the use of a smaller, lighter device than previous detonations by the North in 2006 and 2009, KCNA reported. North Korea's nuclear program is shrouded in secrecy, so it's almost impossible to independently verify many of the details of the test. But its claims play into fears among the United States and its allies that Pyongyang is moving closer to the kind of miniaturized nuclear device that it can mount on a long-range missile. The United States will try to determine if North Korea has tested a uranium weapon for the first time, a senior White House official said. The first two were plutonium bombs. Despite the North's claims of progress Tuesday, analysts say they believe it is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile. "This test isn't going to do that in and of itself, but it is a significant step forward," said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S.-China Institute. Condemnation across the globe After Pyongyang confirmed it had gone ahead with the test in defiance of international pressure, world leaders responded with condemnation. Among those countries criticizing North Korea were the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea -- the five nations that had been in talks with North Korea for years over its nuclear program. "This is a highly provocative act" that threatens regional stability, breaches U.N. resolutions and increases the risk of proliferation, Obama said in a statement. Five things to know about North Korea's planned nuclear test "North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs constitute a threat to U.S. national security and to international peace and security," he said, calling for "further swift and credible action by the international community." Deputy Defense Secretary Ash Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the test appeared to be timed to coincide with Obama's State of the Union speech Tuesday night. "They had several other holidays this week that they could have taken advantage of. They tend to like to do this on holidays," Carter said. South Korea said the test presented "an unforgivable threat to the Korean peninsula's peace and safety." "North Korea should be responsible for all the serious consequences brought by such an action," said Chun Young-woo, national security adviser to South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, who is near the end of his term in office. Obama and Lee spoke Tuesday "to consult and coordinate on the response" to the test, the White House said. Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a statement demanding that North Korea refrain from any nuclear missile program and adhere to U.N. Security Council guidelines. It condemned the test as an affront to the community of nations: "It's doubly sad that we are talking about the state with which our country has a long history of good neighborliness." Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the testing a "grave threat to the safety of Japan and a serious challenge against international disarmament framework based on the non-nuclear proliferation treaty." Military jets in Japan were monitoring radioactive fallout, but all appears to be fine, authorities said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the test "a clear and grave violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions." The China question Perhaps the most closely watched reaction came from China, North Korea's main ally and the source of crucial economic and political support to the regime in Pyongyang. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it "resolutely opposes" the North's latest test, which it noted had taken place "despite the international community's widespread opposition." Beijing summoned the North Korean ambassador to China over its "dissatisfaction" with the test, the ministry said. It said it "strongly" urged North Korean officials to "abide by their promise to denuclearize and take no further action that will worsen the situation." Watch: China's role in Korean crisis The real question, though, is whether Beijing will support significantly tougher measures against its smaller neighbor following the test, something it has refrained from doing in the past. "The Chinese don't like the idea of international sanctions and coercing other countries," Chinoy said. "They still have a strategic interest in maintaining a viable separate North Korea as a buffer against a pro-U.S. South Korea, and that has only become more important as tensions between the U.S. and China have increased." Recent opinion articles published in the state-run Chinese newspaper Global Times suggested Beijing's patience with North Korea may be wearing thin and raised the prospect of reducing support to Pyongyang. But with fears in Beijing of what a possible collapse of the North Korean regime could bring, strong measures appear unlikely for the time being. "I think the key with China right now is that they are necessary to a solution, but we can't expect them to solve the problem for us," said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, a U.S.-based foundation that seeks to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Seismic activity Indications that the test had taken place first emerged when U.S. seismologists reported a disturbance Tuesday morning in North Korea centered near the site of the secretive regime's two previous atomic blasts. The area around the epicenter of the tremor in northeastern North Korea has little or no history of earthquakes or natural seismic hazards, according to U.S. Geological Survey maps. The disturbance reported Tuesday had a magnitude of 5.1 -- upgraded from an initial estimate of 4.9 -- and took place at a depth of about one kilometer, the USGS said. Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said the magnitude of the "artificial tremor" suggested the size of the blast could be in the order of 6 to 7 kilotons, more powerful than the North's two prior nuclear tests. That calculation, though, was based on the USGS's initial estimate of a 4.9-magnitude seismic disturbance, he said. A 5.1-magnitude tremor could indicate a 10-kiloton explosion. News breaks amid key dates in Northeast Asia The test took place at a time when several East Asian countries, including China, North Korea's major ally, are observing public holidays for the Lunar New Year, which began Sunday. It also comes ahead of significant dates in both North and South Korea. On Saturday, North Koreans will celebrate the birthday of Kim Jong Il, the former North Korean leader who died in December 2011 after 17 years in power and was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Un. Watch: What North Korea can actually do And on February 25, the South Korea president-elect, Park Geun-hye, will take office. She had campaigned on a pledge to seek increased dialogue with the North, but Pyongyang's recent moves have left her little room for maneuver. In a statement Tuesday, Park condemned the nuclear test, saying it harmed ties between the two Koreas. North Korea announced last month that it was planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches, all of which it said were part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. It made the threats two days after the United Nations Security Council had approved the broadening of sanctions on the reclusive, Stalinist regime in response to the North's launching of a long-range rocket in December that apparently succeeded in putting a satellite in orbit. Pyongyang said it carried out the launch for peaceful purposes, but it was widely considered to be a test of ballistic missile technology. Threats against the U.S.? The North's recent propaganda has used words and images that imply a threat to the United States, but analysts dismiss the prospect that Pyongyang is willing or able to carry out a military attack on U.S. soil. The latest nuclear test is worrying in military terms, Chinoy said, "but does this mean they can drop a nuclear weapon on Los Angeles? Absolutely not. The notion that they are going to target the U.S. is way off the mark." U.S. analysts say North Korea's first bomb test, in October 2006, produced an explosive yield at less than 1 kiloton (1,000 tons) of TNT. A second test in May 2009 is believed to have been about 2 kilotons, National Intelligence Director James Clapper told a Senate committee in 2012. By comparison, the bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was a 15-kiloton device. The North's latest test on Tuesday suggests the country has made a notable step forward in terms of power, said Jeffrey Lewis, East Asia director at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, part of the Monterey Institute of International Studies. "They were pretty clear they were going to up the yield a lot," Lewis said, and it "looks like they've done that." He also warned that Kim Jong Un's regime may not be ready to relinquish the headlines yet, suggesting that a second test remained a possibility and could happen within a few days. In a commentary last week, the North's KCNA said that Pyongyang had "drawn a final conclusion that it will have to take a measure stronger than a nuclear test to cope with the hostile forces' nuclear war moves." It didn't elaborate on what would be stronger than a nuclear test. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's K.J.

The state is now believed to have conducted three underground nuclear tests. It says that the latest, widely-anticipated third test involved a "miniaturised" nuclear device. Previous tests were in 2006 and 2009, and all of them appear to have originated at a test site called Punggye-ri, also known as P'unggye-yok, in a remote area in the east of the country, near the town of Kilju. Multiple rounds of international negotiations amid a strict sanctions regime - a process, which has been described as a game of cat and mouse - appear to have done little to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions. North Korea's previous tests followed rocket launches. The latest rocket was successfully launched last December. 9 October 2006 Years of posturing and wrangles over the delivery of American aid culminated in October 2006 with an announcement by Pyongyang that it had carried out an underground nuclear explosion. North Korea's first nuclear test exploded a device based on plutonium, rather than enriched uranium. The test was conducted at P'unggye-yok, and US intelligence officials later announced that analysis of radioactive debris in air samples collected a few days after the test confirmed that the blast had taken place. But they estimated that it had not been a powerful one, measuring less than one kiloton, raising questions about the sophistication and effectiveness of the weapon. This is less than a tenth of the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. In response to the test the UN approved military and economic sanctions against North Korea. After years of on-off talks, in February 2007 Pyongyang agreed to shut down its main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in return for aid and diplomatic concessions. But negotiations stalled as North Korea accused its negotiating partners - the US, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia - of failing to meet agreed obligations. Since Kim Jong-un succeeded his father North Korea has continued to send out contradictory messages 25 May 2009 Barely a month after North Korea walked out of international talks on its nuclear programme, it carried out its second underground nuclear test, which was said to be more powerful than the first. Russia's defence ministry estimated a blast of up to 20 kilotons, a similar size to the American bombs that completely destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Although the North gave no details of the test location, South Korean officials said a seismic tremor was detected in its neighbour's north-east around the town of Kilju - close to P'unggye-yok. The US Geological Survey said a 4.7-magnitude quake was detected, 10km (six miles) underground. Geological agencies in both South Korea and the US said the tremor indicated a nuclear explosion.

The underground test followed hard on the heels of the test of a long-range missile that threatened Asia and could have reached the US. The UN issued a resolution condemning the nuclear test and tightened sanctions. And after the US imposed tough sanctions in August 2009, Kim Jong-il said he was willing to resume nuclear talks. November 2010: Tour of Yongbyon In November 2010 a US atomic scientist was given a tour of North Korea's uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon about 100km (60 miles) north of the capital. Siegfried Hecker was shown an experimental light-water nuclear reactor that was still under construction, and perhaps more significantly a new facility that contained "more than 1,000 centrifuges" that the North Koreans said was processing low-enriched uranium to fuel the new reactor. He said the facility seemed designed primarily for civilian nuclear power but that it could easily be converted to further process uranium to weapons grade. The Stanford University scientist described the plant as modern and clean - unlike all the other Yongbyon facilities he had seen - and said he was "stunned" at its sophistication. There are a number of other sites associated with North Korea's nuclear programme around the country. At Taechon, for example, work on a graphite heavy water plant was started, but suspended several years ago. 12 February 2013 In the early hours of 12 February 2013, unusual seismic activity was detected around the Punggye-ri underground nuclear test site. This was followed with confirmation by the state news agency that North Korea had successfully tested a device. "It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment," KCNA said. The reference to "miniaturised" is likely to alarm observers, with fears that Pyongyang's ultimate aim is to produce a device small enough to fit on a long-range missile. In recent weeks speculation has been rife that such a test might involve a uranium device, which could have significant implications for North Korea's nuclear capabilities. However, a well-contained underground test may provide little evidence of this, analysts say.

By Kari Huus, Staff writer, NBC News An unapologetic North Korea declared Tuesday that it had conducted a test of a nuclear bomb after the detonation was detected by the U.S. Geological Survey. "On February 12th... we successfully conducted a third underground nuclear test in the northern underground nuclear test site," the Daily NK reported, in a translation of Pyongyang's announcement on the state-run news agency, KCNA. By conducting the test, the isolated authoritarian regime made good on a Jan. 24 pledge by North Korea's top military organ, the National Defense Commission, in further defiance of admonitions from the international community to cease and desist in its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The test was met with condemnation from around the globe. The White House called it a "highly provocative act" that warrants "further swift and credible action from the international community." Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said Beijing was "strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed" to the move by its neighbor and long-time Communist ally.   South Korea and Japan convened emergency meetings of their top national security officials, while the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting Tuesday, after which it promised to "begin work immediately" to draft a new resolution against the North. &lt;br&gt; Follow @NBCNewsWorld The explosion was registered as a 5.1-magnitude seismic event by the USGS at 9:57 p.m. ET Monday. The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence quickly judged that North Korea had "probably conducted an underground nuclear explosion" with a yield of "several kilotons." In a statement, President Barack Obama said the test "undermines regional stability, violates North Korea's obligations under numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions, contravenes its [international] commitments … and increases the risk of proliferation" in the wake of what he described as a "ballistic missile launch" by North Korea on Dec. 12. "North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs constitute a threat to U.S. national security and to international peace and security," Obama said.  U.S. officials have previously told NBC News that North Korea has up to a "few dozen" nuclear weapons that could be fitted on ballistic missiles, far more than had previously been believed. Obama on Tuesday said that "the danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community," adding that the U.S. would work with the international community to "pursue firm action." 'Vile hostile acts' In a tit-for-tat that has characterized a diplomatic stalemate for decades, North Korea blamed the United States for forcing its hand. "This nuclear test was conducted as part of measures to safeguard the country’s security and independence in order to deal with the vile hostile acts of the United States, which violated our Republic’s legitimate right to peaceful satellite launches,” according to the KCNA report. The comment refers UN Security Council Resolution 2087, passed after to Pyongyang's Dec. 12 rocket launch, heaping sanctions on previous sanctions against North Korea, further deepening the regime's isolation. North Korean soldiers stand guard on the river bank of the North Korean town of Sinuiju, opposite the Chinese border city of Dandong on Tuesday. The resolution called on North Korea to abandon its nuclear program and any weapons and allow verification; to conduct no more launches using ballistic missile technology; and to conduct no more nuclear tests. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the latest test was a "clear and grave violation." Later, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that North Korea threatened, citing an unidentified foreign ministry spokesman, to conduct more nuclear tests if the U.S. moves to penalize it for Tuesday's test. At a disarmament forum in Geneva on Tuesday, a North Korean official said that his country would not change course in the current climate, Reuters reported. "The U.S. and their followers are sadly mistaken if they miscalculate the DPRK would respect the entirely unreasonable resolutions against it. The DPRK will never bow to any resolutions," Jon Yong Ryong, first secretary of North Korea's mission in Geneva, told the Conference on Disarmament, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). South Korea's government said in a statement that Tuesday's nuclear test, "poses a direct challenge to the whole international community as well as an unacceptable threat to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia." It said the government would stand firm in that it "will not tolerate a nuclear North Korea" and added that it will "also accelerate expanding its military capability, including deploying at an early stage its extended-range missiles, currently being developed, which cover all of North Korea." Major hostilities in the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with armistice, not a peace treaty. Today, North Korean forces and South Korean forces bolstered by about 28,000 U.S. troops remain faced off at the 38th parallel, where the Korean Peninsula was divided. Between 2003 and 2007, North Korean took party in several rounds of the so-called "Six Party Talks" with South Korea, China, the United States, Russia and Japan, in an attempt to reverse Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development in return for fuel and progress towards normalization of relations. The talks went on hold and then fell apart for good in April 2009 and Pyongyang expelled UN inspectors from the country. China 'humiliated' A key unanswered question is what Beijing will do after North Korea's latest move. The long-time Communist ally and neighbor, which has strategic reasons to continue supporting the regime in Pyongyang, nonetheless expressed its strong opposition to the test. "China has been humiliated," according to Andrei Lankov, a veteran analyst of North Korea based in Seoul's Kookmin Unversity. That could prompt a change in Beijing's approach, he said. / A North Korean flag flies above the North Korean embassy in Beijing on Feb. 12. "This time, China explicitly warned North Korea against conducting the test, but they were ignored," Landov added. "A Chinese government newspaper said two weeks ago that in the case of a nuclear test, China might significantly reduce its aid to North Korea." China is a major source of aid to North Korea and key to keeping its decrepit economy afloat. China is also one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council with the power to veto sanctions. The United States and other countries have urged China to put pressure on Pyongyang, but it remained to be seen how far Beijing would go to confront its old comrade. "They are not happy about nuclear adventurism. At the same time though, a collapsing non-nuclear North Korea is far worse than a nuclear but stable North Korea," Lankov said. North wants U.S. recognition Professor Yan Xuetong, a top international security analyst at China's Tsinghua University, said "the key to the North Korean nuclear challenge is in the hands of the United States, not China." "China is certainly opposed to North Korea's latest nuclear test and opposed to North Korea becoming a nuclear power, but the test was aimed at the Unite States with the aim of forcing the U.S. to normalize relations with North Korea, but if the U.S. doesn't want to play the  game of trade-off, then there is not much that China can do," he said. Yan, who closely follows government policy thinking on the issue, argued that "the role of economic sanctions is limited," suggesting China will not stop economic assistance to North Korea because of the latest test. "What China should do is to act as bridge between North Korea and the United States so that they will agree to a trade-off, with the U.S. granting recognition to the North Korean government in exchange for it giving up its nuclear program," he said. "If the U.S. views North Korea's nuclear threat with the same seriousness as it views Iran's nuclear threat, then there will be hope for solving the North Korea's nuclear problem," he said.
