The 60-page study by investigators at the Alexandria-based Mandiant security firm presents one of the most comprehensive and detailed analyses to date tracing corporate cyber-espionage to the doorstep of Chinese military facilities. And it calls into question China’s repeated denials that its military is engaged in such activities. The document, first reported by the New York Times, draws on information that Mandiant collected from what the company said was the systematic theft of data from at least 141 organizations over seven years. Mandiant traced the attacks back to a single group it designated “Advanced Persistent Threat 1,” or “APT1,” and now has identified the group as a Chinese military unit within the 2nd Bureau of the People’s Liberation Army General Staff Department’s 3rd Department, code named “Unit 61398.” Although most of the targets were U.S. companies, a Mandiant official said APT1 also hit about a dozen entities that he described as smaller U.S. local, state and federal government agencies and international governmental organizations overseas. Senior U.S. officials, including President Obama, have raised the issue of Chinese cyber attacks on commercial targets over the past year. White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to address the Mandiant report, but he said, “We have repeatedly raised our concerns at highest levels about cybertheft with senior Chinese officials, including the military, and we will continue to do so.” 1 of 12 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad Caption Two decades after the first warnings about “hackers,” the threat has only grown with individuals, companies and even nations at risk. Post reporter Robert O’Harrow Jr. answers six questions about personal and national vulnerability.   Buy Photo Analysts have long linked the unit to the Chinese military’s 3rd Department, and to extensive cyber-espionage. But what Mandiant has done is connect the dots and add new ones by locating the Internet protocol addresses used in commercial cyberattacks, placing them on a map and linking that information to open-source data about people associated with the unit. “Since 2006, Mandiant has observed APT1 compromise 141 companies spanning 20 major industries,” the firm said in its report. Of those victims, 87 percent “are headquartered in countries where English is the native language,” it said. Mandiant did not name the victims but said 115 of them are located in the United States, two in Canada and five in Britain. Of the 19 others, all but two operate in English. One apparent victim was Telvent, a Madrid-based technology company with U.S. headquarters in Rockville that enables energy suppliers and others to remotely control their operations, security researchers and company officials said. Telvent helps manage 60 percent of the flow of hydrocarbons in North America and Latin America, according to its Web site. Technology made by the company, owned by Schneider Electric, also helps control and monitor power grids around the world. Separately Tuesday, Apple Inc. said the same hackers who targeted Facebook last month have also gone after Apple and infiltrated a small number of the company’s computers. Neither company publicly identified the nationality of the hackers. The top sectors targeted by the APT1 cyber-espionage campaign, Mandiant said, are information technology, aerospace, public administration, satellites and telecommunications, and scientific research and consulting. “We have figured things out in an unclassified way that the government has known through classified means,” said Richard Bejtlich, Mandiant chief security officer, adding that the company shared the study with U.S. intelligence agencies before it was released. The unit is just one of dozens working for the Chinese military in cyber-espionage all over the country, analysts say. There are other units within the General Staff Department’s 2nd Department, which conducts military intelligence, and within the Ministry of State Security, which conducts internal counterintelligence and external espionage, according to analysts. APT1, also dubbed “Comment Crew” by security companies that have studied its tactics, focuses on commercial targets overseas, which makes its work more visible to the security firms tracking the intrusions. Chinese units that focus on military and intelligence targets are less visible to the cybersecurity companies. The Chinese military has repeatedly denounced accusations that it is engaging in cyber-espionage, and did so again Tuesday. “Similar to other countries, China faces serious threats from cyberattack and is one of the main victims of cyberattacks in the world,” the Ministry of Defense said. “The Chinese army never supported any hacking activities. The accusation that the Chinese military engaged in cyberattacks is neither professional nor in accordance with facts. “ Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei on Tuesday also challenged the report’s findings. “Hacking attacks are transnational and anonymous,” and determining their origins is extremely difficult, he said. “We don’t know how the evidence in this so-called report can be tenable.” Mandiant investigators said they based their conclusion in part by tracing an overwhelming number of cyberattacks by the APT1 group to networks serving a small area on the edges of Shanghai — the same area where Unit 61398 is believed to be operating in a 12-story building. It also found evidence that China Telecom had provided special high-speed fiber optic lines for those headquarters in the name of national defense. The Mandiant report echoed a classified National Intelligence Estimate by the U.S. intelligence community that concluded that China was the most aggressive perpetrator of a massive campaign of cyber-espionage against commercial targets in the United States.

SET EDITION:  U.S. INTERNATIONAL MÉXICO ARABIC TV:   CNN CNNi CNN en Español HLN Sign up Log in Home TV & Video U.S. World Politics Justice Entertainment Tech Health Living Travel Opinion iReport Money Sports SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Chinese cyber attacks on West are widespread, experts say By Kevin Voigt, CNN updated 9:42 PM EST, Fri February 1, 2013 | STORY HIGHLIGHTS Report: One in every three observed computer attacks in Q3 2012 came from China The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal claim to be victims of Chinese attacks Chinese officials say there are no state-sponsored hacking attacks on Western companies Experts say the number of attacks coming out of China has risen in recent years Hong Kong (CNN) -- Allegations that Chinese hackers infiltrated the computers of two leading U.S. newspapers add to a growing number of cyber attacks on Western companies, governments and foreign-based dissidents that are believed to originate in China, experts say. According to one recent report, one in every three observed computer attacks in the third quarter of 2012 emanated from China. Chinese officials have denied that Beijing has supported any cyber attacks, stressing that hacking is illegal in the country. The New York Times reported Wednesday it had been the target of four months of cyber assaults, which started during an investigation by the newspaper into the wealth reportedly accumulated by relatives of the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. The Wall Street Journal said Thursday that its computer systems also had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers. Cyber security experts say the alleged attack on The New York Times appeared to be similar to previously reported attacks that were linked to China. "To do a spear-phishing attack of this kind is a well-established move in attacks against Google and various U.S. defense contractors from China," said Thomas Parenty, a former employee of the U.S. National Security Agency who now advises foreign firms in China on computer security. NYT attack a wake-up call, security experts say China denies NY Times hack attack China denies NY Times hack attack New York Times: We were hacked "You could say the tools are sort of stock-in-trade" for Chinese hackers, he said. "Spear-phishing" is a technique of disguising an email so that it appears to be from a trusted source, luring the victim to open an attachment or link that unleashes malicious software on the computer. Investigators for The Times say they suspect the technique was used by the hackers to break into the newspaper's system where they were able collect passwords of every Times employee and gain access to the personal computers of 53 employees. Security experts who helped the newspaper to counter the attacks accumulated evidence that the hackers used methods "associated with the Chinese military in the past" to breach the network, The Times said. Chinese denials Asked about The Times's allegations on Thursday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that "all such alleged attacks are groundless, irresponsible accusations lacking solid proof or reliable research results." China has been the victim of cyberattacks and "has laws and regulations prohibiting such actions," the spokesman, Hong Lei, said at a regular news briefing. A separate statement from the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said the country's military "has never supported any hacker activities." But data reported by Western companies suggest that even though Chinese authorities say they prohibit hacking, they are struggling to keep it under control. One-third of all observed computer attacks from July through September last year came from China, according to a report last month from Akamai Technologies, an Internet services company. The United States was a distant second, originating 13% of observed attacks, followed by Russia with 4.7%. "China has been consistently responsible for the largest percentage of observed attacks since (the fourth quarter of) 2011," the report said. The most recent report shows a dramatic upswing in incidents from the Asian country. In the second quarter, 16% of observed cyber attacks came from China, the company said. The executive summary of the report didn't specify from which groups or individuals in China the attacks might have come. Google had a very public spat with the Chinese government in 2010 after it claimed China had led a hacking attack against Google, other technology companies, defense corporations and Chinese dissidents. "In the past they've been pretty much focused on either intellectual properties, such as the hacking of defense companies, or dissidents they want to get at, like the Google Gmail attacks," Parenty said. "In this case, it appears they were trying to be able to get to people who talked to The New York Times -- they could make their lives miserable and send the message: Don't do this. "They love to instill fear so people self censor or limit what they would say or do with the media," he added. Compromised computers Mandiant, the security firm that led the investigation at The New York Times, says there is good reason for concern in the United States. "There are thousands of computers compromising the United States at universities, at Mom and Pop shops -- small organizations without a big cyber security program -- and those computers serve as the beachhead to hack blue-chip American companies," Kevin Mandia, the chief executive of Mandiant, told CNN. "The majority of victims, well over 90% of the victims we have responded to, really don't disclose that these attacks occur" for fear of losing customer trust, Mandia said. "The folks that perpetrated this intrusion have done it to hundreds of other organizations and usually they are very successful," Mandia said. "What's really unique here is the fact that the victim organization, The New York Times, has decided to share this information with the public, so people can be more aware of the problem -- because it's a very pervasive problem." Marc Frons, chief information officer of The Times, told CNN that the newspaper believed it had prevented this attack from revealing confidential sources. In the case of the investigation into Wen's family's finances, much of the information came from public records. But Frons said The Times isn't letting its guard down after expelling the hackers. "I think we're over this phase of the attack and obviously the types of things they tried to do previously they'll have a more difficult time doing, but this isn't over," he said. "As long as there are computers and networks we're going to be faced with cyber espionage threats."

Skip to Content Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World Menu Projects Home U.S. Politics Media & News Social Trends Religion Internet & Tech Hispanics Global Publications Topics Datasets Question Search Global Indicators About February 11, 2013 China and Cyber Attacks: A Top Concern of U.S. Experts By Bruce Drake, Pew Research Center China’s alleged cyber-espionage campaigns against other governments, major corporations and, most recently, the media, have increasingly become a focus of U.S. officials and news reports. In the superpower competition between the U.S. and China, most American experts surveyed in 2012 by the Pew Research Center ranked cyber attacks from China as a more serious problem than the economic or military challenges it poses. The Washington Post reported on Monday that a National Intelligence Estimate — the consensus view of the U.S. intelligence community — identifies China as the country with the most aggressive campaign to obtain information from American businesses and institutions in an effort to gain an economic advantage. Chinese hackers were also said to have infiltrated the New York Times computer system over a four month period, an effort that coincided with the Times’ reports on the financial holdings of the family of China’s Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. The Post and the Wall Street Journal reported similar attacks from China on their computer system. In the Pew Research survey conducted last spring in collaboration with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Kissinger Institute,1 half of the general public cited cyber attacks from China as a very serious problem. They ranked three issues as more worrisome: the amount of American debt held by China (78% very serious problem), followed by loss of jobs to China (71%) and the trade deficit with China (61%). But China’s cyber capabilities were at the top of the list of challenges described as a very serious problem for the U.S. by the five expert groups surveyed: government officials, retired U.S. military officers, scholars, business and trade leaders, and members of the news media. Of 11 issues tested among elites, only cyber attacks from China were considered a very serious problem by at least half across all five groups. The most concerned were retired military officers — 87% said they regarded China’s cyber attacks as a very serious problem. Seven-in-ten business and trade leaders and six-in-ten or more of government officials and scholars agreed. Half of the news media members in the survey cited cyber attacks as a very serious problem for the U.S. The challenges regarded by the general public as the most serious were deemed less important by all the expert groups. China-held U.S. debt — the public’s top concern — was viewed as a very serious problem by 48% of the retired military and 42% of business and trade leaders, but only about one-in-five government officials and scholars. Loss of U.S. jobs to China, the public’s second biggest concern, was viewed as very serious by 23% or fewer of all the expert groups. The public’s third top concern — the trade deficit — was shared by 37% or less of each of the five expert groups.   The survey was part of the broader U.S.-China Security Perceptions Project, conducted in collaboration with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the China Strategic Culture Promotion Association and the Research Center for Contemporary China at Peking University. ↩ Related U.S. Public, Experts Differ on China Policies Topics Asia and the Pacific China Economic Policy International Threats and Allies Internet Activities National Security Popular on Pew Research Fact Tank Jul. 22, 2014 In 30 countries, heads of state must belong to a certain religion Fact Tank Jul. 23, 2014 5 facts about the state of local TV newsrooms Religion Jul. 16, 2014 How Americans Feel About Religious Groups Fact Tank Jul. 22, 2014 Children 12 and under are fastest growing group of unaccompanied minors at U.S. border Fact Tank Jul. 14, 2014 Despite recent shootings, Chicago nowhere near U.S. ‘murder capital’ 1615 L Street, NW, Suite 700 Washington, DC 20036 202.419.4300 | Main 202.419.4349 | Fax 202.419.4372 | Media Inquiries Research Projects Pew Research Center for the People & the Press Pew Research Center’s Journalism Project Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project Pew Research Center’s Religion & Public Life Project Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project Pew Research Center’s Social & Demographic Trends Follow Pew Research Email Newsletters Facebook Twitter Tumblr YouTube Google+ RSS About Pew Research Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping America and the world.

Learn more » Tweet AN AMERICAN information-security firm has identified a secretive Chinese military unit as the likely source of hacking attacks against more than a hundred companies around the world. In a report made public on Tuesday, the firm, Mandiant, based in Alexandria, Virginia, said it could now back up suspicions it first reported in more qualified form in 2010. The firm had said then the Chinese government may have authorised the hacking activity it had traced to China, but that there was “no way to determine the extent” of official involvement. In its new report, Mandiant upgrades its assessment. “The details we have analysed during hundreds of investigations convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese government is aware of them,” the report said. China’s government has denied the allegations. Hong Lei, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said on February 19th that China has itself been a victim of cyber-attacks, and that it enforces laws that ban such activity. “Groundless criticism is irresponsible and unprofessional, and it will not help to solve the problem," he said of the Mandiant report. According to the report, a Shanghai-based unit of the People’s Liberation Army General Staff Department, known as Unit 61398, is staffed by hundreds and possibly thousands of people specially trained in network security, digital signal processing, covert communications and English linguistics. The unit’s 12-storey building (pictured above) has been equipped with special fibre-optic communications infrastructure “in the name of national defence”. Mandiant said that since 2006, it has observed attacks from this unit against at least 141 companies spanning 20 major industries, including four of the seven strategic emerging industries that China has identified in its current five-year plan. The New York Times, which hired Mandiant to investigate China-based cyber-attacks against its news operations, was the first to report on the firm’s findings. Mandiant concluded that the attacks against the newspaper had come from a different Chinese source. In the case of the attacks described in the new report, Mandiant said it could not prove that the attacks came from within the military building it identified. But it concluded that this was the most plausible explanation for its findings. “Either they are coming from inside Unit 61398, or the people who run the most-controlled, most-monitored Internet networks in the world are clueless about thousands of people generating attacks from this one neighbourhood,” Kevin Mandia, the founder and chief executive of the company told the paper.

Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism. Fascists seek to unify their nation through a totalitarian state that seeks the mass mobilization of the national community through ethnocentrism and indoctrination. Fascism advocates a state-controlled and regulated mixed economy; the principal economic goal of fascism is to achieve autarky to secure national self-sufficiency and independence, through protectionist and interventionist economic policies. It promotes regulated private enterprise and private property contingent whenever beneficial to the nation and state enterprise and state property whenever necessary to protect its interests.

Item 2 - if we really want evidence to prove or disprove that China hacks or doesn't hack then do something similar to what the US did to Japan in WWII. In 1942 US intel, which was able to decode much of Japan's coded transmissions knew Japan was planning an attack and knew the timing, but couldn't be certain of where. This was because Japan used code words for the location which were then coded before transmission. So even when decoded all that you got was a code word which was meaningless. In other words the US could break the portion of the code which said "Imperial fleet to attack and invade AF at dawn August 20th" but no one knew what AF stood for. They suspected it was Midway Island, but needed to know. So the US sent out an innocuous uncoded message from Midway that one of their water desalinization units had failed. Later the US picked up a coded Japanese message that US base on AF may have low water supplies. So now the US knew AF was Midway. So do something similar with misinformation to see just how prevalent China hacking is. For example, create a stream of emails, documents, etc. about some major false deals between US and UK companies and see if China reacts in a way which indicates it was acting on that information. Obviously it would have to be a complex scheme and require more than just one deal or activity. But it can be pulled off as the UK and US showed brilliantly in creating all kinds of radio traffic, paper trails, turned agents, etc. during WWII to dupe the Germans into believing the Allied invasion of Europe would be at Calais when in fact it was Normandy. Expensive - yes. But less so than the value of information China is stealing if the accusations are true. And if it is true that the Chinese miliatry is doing all this hacking, then there we be an evidence trail which could be put up for the world to see to prove that China is engaged in cyber spying. Basically it would be as good as when the Soviets dragged in U2 pilot Gary Powers who'd been shot down over the USSR despite Eisenhower denying the US was flying spy missions over Soviet territory. At the very least, it would create a situation where if China is hacking, they would have to start second guessing about whether what they were finding was real or false information. And this alone would have a significant impact on the value to them of any stolen information.

There is an interesting piece today in the Foreign Policy magazine: "Think you knew all there was to know about Stuxnet, the worm that was discovered in 2010 to have destroyed thousands of uranium enrichment centrifuges at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility? Think again. It appears that an early version of the worm was attacking Iran's nuclear program years before the version that made headlines in 2010 was unleashed, according to a new report by the IT Security firm Symantec. Dubbed Stuxnet 0.5, the early version of the worm attacked Iran's nuclear program by closing valves that allowed uranium hexafloride gas (UF6) to flow into the centrifuges at Natanz, according to Symantec. Cutting off the flow of UF6 would, in theory, damage the centrifuges. Some cybersecurity experts fear that cyberweapons like Stuxnet can be reverse-engineered and used against their creators or sold on the ever-growing black market for cyber weapons. "The difference between traditional weapons and cyber weapons is that it's not possible to [re]assemble a cruise missile after it has been used," said cyber security expert Eugene Kaspersky last September in Washington. "Cyber weapons are different" because the victims "can learn from" weapons used against them. As another cyber security expert told Killer Apps last fall: Because uranium centrifuges and power turbines are both spinning machines, "the attack is identical -- the one to take out the centrifuges and the one to take out our power systems is the same attack." "If a centrifuge running at the wrong speed can blow apart" so can a power generator, said the expert. "If you do, in fact, spin them at the wrong speeds, you can blow up any rotating device." We do not know whether Stuxnet has been reverse-engineered yet. However, intelligence reports (and even some journalistic sources) have stated that the Chinese have it and are modifying it for military use - i.e., for disabling the propulsion systems of US aircraft carriers, etc. Like nuclear weapons, cyber technology will proliferate unless there are some international ground rules. The other option is - do nothing. After some major secrets are stolen, the USA might come around to discussing a "cyber non-proliferation treaty".

Also, while I marginally support and understand the Chinese position on the currency, it is clear to any economist that China intentionally undervalues its currency to fuel exports.

WP reported that the hacking information was given to the U.S. government by Mandiant. The questions is why wouldn’t the U.S. government present this so called massive breach to the Chinese government and ask for explanation instead of spreading such news using a third party with headline condemnations all over the globe. What are the agenda here and who is behind and funding this costly probe? Are these 2 countries in cold war that the 2 governments would not talk to each other? Think about this for a minute - propaganda works both ways. It is as easy for a “Chinese company” in China to say that it has some evidence that ‘unit xxxx’ of US Military in xxxx is conducting hacking, and it would be a true story as everyone know that the cyber unit in U.S. DOD also engages in cyber espionage with huge budget and supreme expertise. This being said, there is no doubt China probes America's IT infrastructure and there is also no doubt America does the same on China's IT infrastructure. America is no Saint, nor is China. Every country is hacking others. Just make sure you are number 1. Ever since the half failure of U.S. TPP initiative to contain China’s economic power and Asian/European countries are still having more and more trade with China, America is now engaging in industrial propaganda wars against China, first with Huawei with no evidence whatsoever and now this. Let’s hope this will not develop into a full blown war of WWIII. No need to worry or paranoid, America’s world hegemony and supremacy will still be with us in the foreseeable future.

The truth is Chinese entities have been hacked by many American hackers. Therefore, this accusation against Chinese hackers and especially pointing the finger at Chinese military is not only spurious but also belligerent. America is obviously trying to browbeat Xi as he is stepping into the position of leadership of China. . Ever since Colin Powell had staked his reputation to convince the world of WMD in Iraq, American credibility has been zero. Who can now believe anything Americans say? Chinese military hacking American companies is just as spurious as Iraqi WMD. . But as Xi assumes the office of Chinese presidency he must remind himself constantly that his job is not a Sunday picnic in the park. It is a job not for the faint of heart. It is a stormy turbulent job where he must be strong and single-minded in protecting the sovereignty of China above all else. The only effective way to defend against attacks from foreign countries is always with force. He must make foreign aggressors understand that China can and will defend itself and will not tolerate unjust aggressions. He must understand that there is no goodwill in China's former enemies who are still seeking to defeat and dominate China. He must understand that no peace offering will be accepted as a jesture of peace but only as a sign of weakness. And if China were perceived as weak then the result is not peace but unending turbulent aggression. Therefore, if China wants peace then it must gain and maintain it with force of arms.

By Erin McClam, Staff Writer, NBC News A report tying the Chinese military to computer attacks against American interests has sent a chill through cyber-security experts, who worry that the very lifelines of the United States — its energy pipelines, its water supply, its banks — are increasingly at risk. Follow @NBCNewsUS The experts say that a successful hacker attack taking out just a part of the nation’s electrical grid, or crippling financial institutions for several days, could sow panic or even lead to loss of life. “I call it cyberterrorism that makes 9/11 pale in comparison,” Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican and chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told NBC News on Tuesday. An American computer security company, Mandiant, reported with near certainty that members of a sophisticated Chinese hacking group work out of the headquarters of a unit of the Chinese army outside Shanghai. The report was first detailed in The New York Times, which said that the hacking group’s focus was increasingly on companies that work with American infrastructure, including the power grid, gas lines and waterworks. The Chinese embassy in Washington told The Times that its government does not engage in computer hacking. As reported, the Chinese attacks constitute a sort of asymmetrical cyberwarfare, analysts said, because they bring the force of the Chinese government and military against private companies. “To us that’s crossing a line into a class of victim that’s not prepared to withstand that type of attack,” Grady Summers, a Mandiant vice president, said on the MSNBC program “Andrea Mitchell Reports.” The report comes as government officials and outside security experts alike are sounding ever-louder alarms about the vulnerability of the systems that make everyday life in the United States possible. A new report confirmed by U.S. intelligence officials has pinpointed a building in Shanghai where those working for the Chinese military launched cyberattacks against 141 US companies spanning 20 industries. NBC's Andrea Mitchell reports. Outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned in October that the United States was facing a threat that amounted to “cyber Pearl Harbor” and raised the specter of intentionally derailed trains, contaminated water and widespread blackouts. “This is a pre-9/11 moment,” Panetta told business executives in New York. “The attackers are plotting.” RELATED: Report: Chinese army tied to widespread U.S. hacking The Times report described an attack on Telvent, a company that keeps blueprints on more than half the oil and gas pipelines in North and South America and has access to their systems. A Canadian arm of the company told customers last fall that hackers had broken in, but it immediately cut off the access so that the hackers could not take control of the pipelines themselves, The Times reported. Dale Peterson, founder and CEO of Digital Bond, a security company that specializes in infrastructure, told NBC News that these attacks, known as vendor remote access, are particularly worrisome. “If you are a bad guy and you want to attack a lot of different control systems, you want to be able to take out a lot,” he said. “The dirty little secret in these control systems is once you get through the perimeter, they have no security at all. They don’t even have a four-digit pin like your ATM card.” Carlos Barria / Reuters Locals walks in front of 'Unit 61398', a secretive Chinese military unit, in the outskirts of Shanghai. The unit is believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks, a U.S. computer security company said. The 34-minute blackout at the Super Bowl earlier this month highlighted weak spots in the nation’s power system. A National Research Council report declassified by the government last fall warned that a coordinated strike on the grid could devastate the country. That report considered blackouts lasting weeks or even months across large parts of the country, and suggested they could lead to public fear, social turmoil and a body blow to the economy. Vital systems do not have to be taken down for very long or across a particularly widespread area, the experts noted, to cause social disorder and to spread fear and anxiety among the population. Last fall, after Hurricane Sandy battered the Northeast, it took barely two days for reports of gasoline shortages to cause hours-long lines at the pumps and violent fights among drivers. Peterson described being in Phoenix, Ariz., during a three-day gas pipeline disruption “when people were waiting in line six hours and not going to work. You can imagine someone does these things maliciously, with a little more smarts, something that takes three months to replace.” Similarly, hacking attacks last fall against major American banks — believed by some security experts and government officials to be the work of Iran — amounted to mostly limited frustration for customers, but foreshadowed much bigger trouble if future attacks are more sophisticated. What worries Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the computer security company CrowdStrike, is a coordinated attack against banks that modifies, rather than destroys, financial data, making it impossible to reconcile transactions. “You could wreak absolute havoc on the world’s financial system for years,” he said. “It would be impossible to roll that back.” While the report Tuesday focused on China, the experts also highlighted Iran as a concern. That is because China, as a “rational actor” state, knows that a major cyberattack against the United States could be construed as an act of war and would damage critical economic cooperation between the U.S. and China. “With the Iranians in the game,” Rogers said, “what’s worrisome is they don’t care. They have no economic lost opportunity.” Security experts have for years expressed concern, if not outrage, that the nation’s critical infrastructure remains so vulnerable so long after Sept. 11, 2001.   But the escalating threats from hackers in China and Iran, in addition to Russia and North Korea, appear to be lending new urgency to efforts to make sure companies and government agencies are better prepared. President Barack Obama announced in his State of the Union message last week that he had signed an executive order directing federal agencies to share certain unclassified reports of cyber threats with American companies. The next day, Rogers and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Maryland Democrat, reintroduced legislation designed in part to help companies share information. The bill passed the House last year but stalled in the Senate. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday that the United States has “substantial and growing” concerns about threats to the U.S. economy and national security posed by cyberattacks. “I think as recent public reports make clear, we’re obviously going to have to keep working on this,” she said. “It’s a serious concern.” Peterson said that oil, gas and electric companies had led the way in developing security perimeters, with water companies “kind of in the middle” and transportation and mining companies lagging. But even the protections enacted by companies so far leave too many holes, he said. “They’re all in the same situation,” Peterson said. “If you get through the perimeter, you can do whatever you want.” A U.S. security firm has exposed the role of the Chinese military in an overwhelming number of cyber-attacks on U.S. infrastructure, government agencies, and corporations, resulting in the theft of information from military contractors and energy companies.
