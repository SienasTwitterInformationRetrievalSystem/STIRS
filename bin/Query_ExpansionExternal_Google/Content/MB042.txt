It has also formally protested to Iran because Ms Bahrami was interred 400km (250 miles) from the capital without her family being present. Sahra Bahrami was hanged on 29 January after a drug smuggling conviction condemned by relatives as "fabricated". She was detained in 2009 for taking part in anti-government protests. A Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that it had conveyed its message of protest about Ms Bahrami's "sudden burial" to the Iranian ambassador, Kazem Gharib Abadi. Sahra Bahrami was reported to have been hanged at Evin prison in Tehran. The Dutch government asked for her remains to be passed to her daughter in Tehran for a funeral. "[Ms Bahrami's daughter] wasn't granted that, but heard she'd been buried 400 km away," a spokesman told the BBC News website. Although she was told in advance of the burial, she was given too little notice to attend, he added. The Dutch ambassador is due to fly home from Tehran on Thursday but is then expected to return. The foreign ministry spokesman said further measures were being considered. The Netherlands froze contacts with Iran last month, condemning its government as a "barbarous regime".

The Dutch Foreign Ministry feels Zahra Bahrami's remains were treated "disrespectfully" after she was hanged just over a week ago, a spokesman said. "Her body was not returned to her family. Instead it was buried 400 kilometres from Tehran. Bahrami's family was informed at the very last minute," the spokesman said, declining to be named. The Netherlands is summoning the Iranian ambassador over the case, and will protest officially with the Iranian foreign ministry, the spokesman added. Iran hanged Bahrami in late January, saying she was a drug smuggler. The Netherlands called it a "shocking act by a barbaric regime." But the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran suggested the drug charges were only a pretext to execute her. The campaign said Bahrami was originally charged with security offenses in the wake of widespread protests against the government over a controversial presidential election in June 2009. Bahrami was accused of bringing cocaine into the country twice and selling it. Cocaine and opium were found during a search of her house, the semi-official Fars news agency reported January 29. Her sentence also included 70 lashes and a $1,400 fine, Fars reported. Fars added that during a search of her house, while she was charged with security crimes, 450 grams of cocaine and 420 grams of opium were discovered and, following further investigation, it was found that she had also distributed 150 grams of cocaine. Iran denied Bahrami access to Dutch consular assistance and would not let Dutch officials attend her trial because Tehran did not recognize her dual citizenship, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands said on January 5. CNN'S Bharati Naik contributed to this report.

This Black Sista's Page commentary on the news of the day…and then some     Saturday Night Music, January 29, 2011: The Marvelettes, “Too Many Fish in The Sea,” and The Ancestors Call Its First Lead Singer, Gladys Horton, 66 This is one of the recordings I liked best from The Marvelettes. The other is “The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game.” On Thursday, The Ancestors took home Gladys Horton (right), former lead singer of The Marvelettes, from the lingering effects of a stroke that she suffered last year. Horton had been living in Southern California with her family since the early 1970s. Raised by foster parents, she was only 15 (17 in one account), when she recorded “Please Mr. Postman” with Motown. It stayed on the charts as number one for six months. The recording also features Marvin Gaye, uncredited, as drummer. Horton died Wednesday in Sherman Oaks at age 65, said her other son, Vaughn Thornton. She had been in declining health for some time. “Gladys was a very, very special lady, and I loved the way she sang with her raspy, soulful voice,” Motown founder Berry Gordy said in a statement. “We will all miss her, and she will always be a part of the Motown family.” The Marvelettes never topped the chart again, but they had six Top 20 singles, including “Beachwood 4-5789,” “Don’t Mess With Bill” and “Playboy.” The Beatles recorded a version of “Please Mr. Postman” that was on their second U.S. album, and the Carpenters brought the song back to No.1 with their 1975 remake. The original group — five students at Detroit’s Inkster High School — was given a Motown audition after a school talent contest. After signing, they were asked to come up with an original song, so member Georgia Dobbins reworked a blues song that she got from a friend (an actual mailman, William Garrett). Others, including Motown producers Robert Bateman and Brian Holland, also have been listed as co-writers. With its rough edges and aggressive attitude, “Postman” sounded more like a product of the era’s girl-group genre than the Motown hit machine that would soon develop, and the Marvelettes’ prime period predated Motown’s famous “charm school” grooming process. As unpolished as they were, they were the first queens at the label, a position that led to some conflicts with their rivals. In one famous incident, the Supremes’ Diana Ross punctuated a bout of bickering with Horton by driving a car in her direction and screeching to a stop with little room to spare. Still think Diana Ross deserves all our sympathy? But I digress. Apparently, Georgia Dobbins’ church-going dad didn’t want his daughter singing in nightclubs. So reluctantly, on the eve of what might have been for Georgia, Gladys Horton filled in that spot, and the rest was music history.  The group varied from three to four singers over its eight-year run ; the original line-up was Gladys Horton, Katherine Anderson, Wyanetta (usually misnamed as “Juanita”) Cowart,  Georgeanna Tillman, and Wanda Young. Gladys Horton in the 1980s; it looks like a promotional photo for her club dates (Courtesy: DivasAndDJs) The Marvelettes provided Berry Gordy with Motown’s first number one single on the Billboard Top 100 with “Please Mr. Postman,” but there would never again be another hit single like it for the group, despite later successes like “The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game,” and “Beechwood 4-5789.”   In all, three singles were Top 10 Pop singles, nine were  Top 10 R&B singles and their debut single, “Postman,” was number one on both charts.  Horton, though, proved too bluesy for Gordy’s marketing tastes. Eventually, with the group taken in hand by Motown vice president Smokey Robinson, Wanda Young replaced Horton as lead when Horton left the group to get married in 1967.  Horton divided her time between performing solo as “Gladys Horton of The Marvelettes,” and caring for her handicapped son. Because what isn’t widely known is that Gladys Horton, as the co-founder of The Marvelettes, spent the rest of her life trying to wrest the name back after it was sold by Berry Gordy to a promoter, Larry Marshak, that fronted girl groups who sang The Marvelettes’ hit songs.  If Horton had regained control, she could have reformed part or all of the old group, toured or even recorded again.  Or she could have fronted her own chosen group members around the country.   This would have resulted in Horton (and other Marvelettes) amassing hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of dollars a year. So remember, those of you who like to attend oldies shows, if there is any group claiming to be The Marvelettes, understand that they may not  be the original members.  A clear hint would be that these groups are years younger than what the original members would be.  As a result of former Supreme Mary Wilson’s activism on this matter, since 2006, an oldies group must have at least one original member to qualify for the name. The Marvelettes have not yet been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Wikipedia has a list of what has happened to the surviving Marvelettes here. Rest in peace, Gladys. 0.000000 0.000000 About these ads Rate this: Share this: Like this: Like Loading... Related ~ by blksista on January 29, 2011.

Why the Obama Administration Doesn’t Seem to Care January 26, 2011   By Rachel Ehrenfeld In his State of the Union speech on January 25th, the President stated: “The Afghan government will need to deliver better governance. But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them.” It is not a secret that President Karzai’s government is rife with corruption.  It is misappropriating and siphoning off as many billions dollars from foreign aid, as it can. This lawlessness deepens the region's political and economic instability that enables the Taliban and other insurgencies to prosper. Sources close to the investigation of the “fraud” at Afghanistan’s largest bank, Kabul Bank, confirmed that the inquires identified that among the suspects of fraud and suspicious loans to the bank's shareholders, are the President brother Mahmoud Karzai, and Haseen Fahim, the brother of the first vice president, Gen. Muhammad Qasim Fahim. The IMF estimates the loss at $850 million. However, knowledgeable independent sources who wish to remain nameless say the loss totals  more than one billion dollar. How could this happen?  The Chairman of Kabul Bank is alleged to have bought 20 condos on Dubai's Palm Jumeirah Island, averaging  $7 million per condo. He bought them in his personal name with depositors’ money. He maintains that he bought them for the “benefit of ‘certain’ people who want to remain anonymous.” But it has been discovered that the condos are occupied by relatives of Cabinet members, including Mahmoud Karzi, the president’s brother. This is but one example of Karzai's government rampant corruption. Incredibly, most U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Treasury programs and projects do not include any consideration for the criminogenic environments created by pouring huge funding into Finance, Health and Infrastructure projects in Afghanistan, with little or no oversight. U.S. Bank supervision assistance to the Central Bank does NOT include a program to detect or prevent fraud. The reason for this, according to an AID officer: “we don’t want to offend the counterparts by including Criminal conduct prevention measures.” It is time the Obama Administration to talk less about “good governance,” and stops the corrupting relationship with the Afghan government. It is time to stop the politically correct attitude that allows the disappearance of billions of dollars aimed at improving the condition of the Afghan’s people. And it is time to take serious action to prevent the massive fraud perpetrated by the Afghans, and often executed in partnership with members of international aid agencies and foreign contractors. Although the President did not mention it in his address, fighting and corruption in Afghanistan will continue unless the U.S. takes steps using environmentally safe methods to eradicate Afghan opium poppy and Hashish cultivation and heroin production.  The Afghan people would benefit from a stable government that could help build a stable economy, only once the vast illegal income that generates hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues are eliminated. Until then, expect more of the same.   Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld, Director of the NY based American Center for Democracy, and author of Funding Evil; How Terrorism is Financed – and How to Stop It.

Perhaps now that the U.S. debt crossed 14 Trillion dollars, would be a good time to stop funding this corrupt organization that fosters the Palestinian “refugees” problem and funds Hamas. UNRWA began its emergency food and shelter aid programs Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Gaza, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon in May 1950. Over the years, though its official mandate remained the same, UNRWA has been providing governmental and development services. UNRWA’s former legal advisor and general counsel, James G. Lindsay, published in 2009 an important study: “Fixing UNRWA: Repairing the UN’s Troubled System of Aid to Palestinian Refugees.” Mr. Lindsay shows how UNRWA changed its function from status based (refugees) to need based  (dependents). More than six decades later, and despite the establishment of an independent Palestinian governing body, UNRWA continues to operate in parallel with the government, both in the PA ruled West Bank and Hamas ruled Gaza. The world community facilitated Hamas’ victory in the 2006 Palestinian Authority election, when it allowed Hamas to run under the name “List of Change and Reform.” In June 2007, Hamas took control over the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority (PA). Since then, despite repeated promises to cut off funds to Hamas, international aid organizations and many countries have continued funneling money to Gaza, purportedly for humanitarian aid, but more recently to fund the “Gaza Administration.” Hamas’ rule over Gaza does not seem to be an obstacle to funding it.  Although the U.S. designation of Hamas terrorists (individuals) is insufficient, the organization and its various entities are designated by the Treasury Department on its Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN). But the UN does not list Hamas as a terrorist organization. The UN only lists the Taliban and al Qaeda as terrorists. The May 2009 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report includes UNRWA’s admission that it does not screen prospective staff or aid recipients for ties to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic Jihad (IJG), or other local terrorist groups. The GAO report stated: “According to UNRWA, the UN Security Council has various working groups for terrorism-related issues, but the Sanctions Committee’s UN 1267 list is currently the only such UN terrorist screening list available….the list is limited to those individuals or entities affiliated with Al-Qaida and the Taliban and thus does not specifically include major regional groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, which the United States has designated as foreign terrorist organizations.” By the end of 2007, UNRWA employed more than 29,000, Less than 200 were listed as “international,” the rest were Palestinian, organized in unions. UNRWA’s Arab workers union is controlled by Hamas. In 2003 Hamas won more than 90% of the votes. In 2005, UNRWA provided a large increase in salaries for its thousands of workers. Since HAMAS deducts 3%-5% of the UNRWA paid annual salaries as membership fees, the raise contributes directly to HAMAS’ coffers. Through another affiliate, the Islamic Bloc, Hamas also controls the UNRWA teachers union and UNRWA-funded schools in Gaza. However this did not seem to disturb UNRWA’s former Commissioner Peter Hansen, who in October 2004 told the Canadian Broadcasting Cooperation “I am sure that there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll, and I don’t see that as a crime.” UNRWA facilities and personnel have also been tied to numerous terrorist attacks on Israel. Its schools have been used as meeting places for Hamas terrorists and weapons storage, and UNRWA’s Hamas affiliated staff members have used UNRWA equipment to transport arms for use in terrorist activities. For example, IDF captured documents and evidence during Operation Cast Lead in 2008, showed that the UNRWA school compound across from the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis was used by Hamas to launch rockets into Israel, and that other UNRWA schools were used to store weapons and to hide Hamas operatives. On January 12, 2009, Israeli Public Security Minister Avi Dichter stated that Shifa Hospital, Gaza City’s main medical center, has become the de facto Hamas headquarters, and that: “Shifa Hospital has long ago ceased to be just a hospital, just as the UN humanitarian and health services in Gaza long ago ceased to be just humanitarian services providing food and medical services.” Still, UNRWA’s response was: ”Where any abuse of UN installations is discovered the UN carries out disciplinary action, including dismissals.” Not surprisingly, in January 2011, Hamas announced that it  won 70.5% of Gaza’s Nursing Association’s representatives vote. Their competitors, another terrorist designated groups, the Islamic Jihad (IJG), won 29.5%. UNRWA pays their salaries. In 2009, following Israel’s operation Cast Lead, conducted to stop Hamas & Islamic Jihad rockets attacks on Israel, the European Commission pledged at least $554 to Gaza in “humanitarian aid.” In June 2010, the Obama administration promised $400 million in aid to the West Bank and Gaza. In March 2009, the U.S. pledged $300 million earmarked for Gaza and $600 million to the West Bank. UNRWA annually transfers about $200 million in cash to Gaza. PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad sends $120 million a month from its budget (most of which comes from foreign aid) to Gaza. In September 2010, he openly stated that he had sent Gaza $4.3 billion over the previous three years, part of which pays the salaries of Hamas municipal employees. According to Mr., Fayyad, 54% of the PA’s $3.17 billion 2010 budget went to Gaza. In 2009, following Israel’s operation Cast Lead to stop Hamas & Islamic Jihad rockets attacks on Israel, the European Commission pledged at least $554 to Gaza in “humanitarian aid.” Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE promised billions more.  But these wealthy Arab nations are known to renege on their financial aid to the Palestinians, including Hamas. Their promises get them lots of publicity, while they let the West foot the bill. For example, an October 2010 Foreign Policy article reported that “Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, pledged $30 million for U.N. humanitarian operations in Gaza… the money has never arrived.” However, UNWRA does not rely only on pledges. The UN agency raises money for Gaza through its Web site, with payments going through WorldPay (part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group), the Arab Bank PLC in Gaza and HSBC in Amman, Jordan. Those funds come in addition to UNRWA’s annual budget of $400 million. How much of it goes to Hamas members? Incredibly,UNRWA calls it’s own tune, while the U.S. pays for it. UNRWA have long violated and subverted U.S. principles and interests, but it will soon ask to renew its mandate that is about to expire in June. It is time the House Foreign Affairs Committee recommends to end the wasting of U.S. taxpayers’ money on the terrorist supporting UNRWA.

By Alyssa A. Lappen Pajamas Media | Jan. 18, 2011 Defending the rights to free speech of editor, columnist and Danish and International Free Press Society president Lars Hedegaard — especially the right to criticize orthodox Islam as freely as one may Christianity or Judaism — now equals defending the right of Western civilization to survive. 1 Barring an effective international outcry — or a rare fever of Sudden Enlightenment Syndrome one morning soon awakening Denmark’s Public Prosecutor with common sense — Hedegaard will face trial on Danish racism charges and conviction alike on Jan. 24, 2011: 2 a veritable auto da fé. In Dec. 2009, Hedegaard remarked in a taped interview upon certain domestic violence peculiar to Muslim families (“they” rape their own children). He was then charged as a common criminal. 3 In 1969, Denmark’s proud history of supporting freedom, whatever the cost, enticed me to live for a summer with a family of potters in Grena, Jutland. In the 1940s, Denmark saved virtually its entire Jewish population from a regime whose totalitarianism many Islamic leaders now hope to best. Since then, Denmark may have gone rotten. The state apparently deems it far less criminal for groups driven by ideological or religious belief to behave criminally, than for anyone to publicly observe their heinous deeds. All the more, as (in this case) said criminal behavior would in other situations scandalize civilized people. Should a modern Danish coven of warlocks and witches regularly rape and roast their teenage daughters, doubtless the public prosecutor would charge no one for saying as much. Alas, Hedegaard challenges modern Danish liberalism too, as he did in a Jan. 2009 interview with me. 4 Denmarks’ Public Prosecutor charged Hedegaard with racism for allegedly violating article 266 b of its penal code, (aka “racism clause”). This allows a prosecutor to infer criminal offense in any statement that he believes threatens, demeans or ridicules anyone based on race, skin color, national or ethnic origin, religious faith or sexual orientation. In other words, the law gives the prosecutor endless latitude to levy criminal charges over a wide range of easily misconstrued statements by or about — well, almost anyone.5 This absurdity of law in effect lets Denmark’s public prosecutor lavish his taxpayer-funded time on perusing news and other taped records of public figures for factual statements on Islam or predominantly Muslim behaviors; and that is how he seems to cast his own prejudiced net. In North America, free speech is presumed a fundamental right cemented into the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution — namely the first article in the Bill of Rights that Congress passed, the states ratified and U.S. law adopted on Dec. 15, 1791. It naturally includes the right to criticize almost anything, short of treason, charges for which the U.S. has not prosecuted in a very long while. Moreover, foreigners can no longer easily rebuke Americans via foreign lawsuits for taking full advantage of that enshrined U.S. freedom. 6 But in the early 1960s, orthodox Islamic believers calling themselves the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan, in Arabic) initiated global efforts to destroy the West and its values, free speech foremost among them. By their thinking, God alone can make laws, not man — the only just laws therefore being Islamic (sharia). All others, especially secular Western laws, must go, particularly those allowing what Islamic law considers blasphemy and a capitol offense — any criticism of Islam or Mohammed. In 1982 and again in 1991, the Brothers set to paper their long-held plans to decimate Western societies and impose global Islamic law. They declared war on basic human rights — evolved from Judeao-Christian traditions codified in King Henry I’s 1100 C.E. Charter of Liberties, 7and expanded into various forms of due process 8 via Britain’s 1215 Magna Carta, 9 King Edward I’s 1305 writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, 10 New York’s 1683 Charter of Liberties and Privileges, 11 William Penn’s 1701 Pennsylvania Charter of Privileges, 12 the U.S. 1791 Bill of Rights, article § 77 of the Danish Constitution (letting anyone publish without censorship or government consent) — and a host of like statutes in most Western nations. These culminated with the United Nation’s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirming human rights to “enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want….” 13 Upon first hearing of MB plans, Westerners generally react with stupefied incredulity. Some furiously rage at the messenger. Yet global Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yusuf Qaradawi concretely stipulated 14 these MB plans on Dec. 1, 1982 in “Towards a worldwide strategy for Islamic policy (Points of Departure, Elements, Procedures and Missions),” 15 which Swiss officials discovered in Nov. 2001 at the villa of MB chief financial officer Yusuf Nada. 16 North American MB chief Mohamed Akram on May 22, 1991 created a similar “regional” outline in an “Explanatory memorandum for the General Strategic goal for the Group in North America,” 17 presented as evidence by U.S. prosecutors to help convict five Holy Land Foundation officials of 108 terror-financing related charges. 18 The realities behind this decades-long Muslim Brotherhood campaign have now slammed Europe. On Dec. 3, 2010, Denmark’s public prosecutor figuratively collected his first scalp for racism, that of pastor and Member of Parliament Jesper Langballe, 19 not surprisingly for defending Hedegaard. “Of course Lars Hedegaard should not have said that there are Muslim fathers who rape their daughters,” Langballe stated, “when the truth appears to be that they make due with killing their daughters (the so-called honor killings) and leave it to their uncles to rape them.” Randers municipal court found MP Langballe (Danish People’s Party) guilty of hate speech under Denmark’s penal code, Article 266b after duly honoring Danish legal precedent to deny Langballe the right to prove his truthful allegation that Muslim families often sexually abuse and murder their daughters for family honor. In such cases, Danish law figures the truth immaterial. As if under Islamic libel law itself, 20 Denmark may nowadays convict a defendant solely upon the personal offense taken or perceived in his or her statement. No actual crime need have occurred. At his kangaroo court trial, MP Langballe therefore concluded, “With this article in the penal code, I must be assumed convicted in advance. I have no intention of participating in this circus. Therefore I confess.” Denmark denied MP Langballe both freedom of speech and due process and may now fine or incarcerate him up to two years. 21 These are but the latest journalists, elected European officials and humanitarians charged for perceived defamations of Islam in their statements of fact and exact reiterations of Quranic and other Islamic sacred texts. Finland first stepped to the plate, in 2009 convicting its best known political blogger, Jussi Kristian Halla-aho, then 38. 22 However in May 2008, Gregorius Nekschot, a pseudonymous Dutch cartoonist was similarly arrested and charged with discriminatory speech. In Sept. 2010, Dutch prosecutors finally dropped charges against Nekschot, on the eve of Holland’s next travesty of justice. Despite a court order that he dismantle his personal website, Nekschot was victorious. “I can carry on making caricatures, perhaps even more controversial ones, because I have been allowed to keep my anonymity,” he said.23 Then came five charges of hate speech against Dutch MP Geert Wilders. Prosecutors initially ruled that Wilders’ statements might hurt Muslim feelings but weren’t crimes. But in Jan. 2009, Amsterdam’s Appeals Court reversed the finding and ordered prosecutors to proceed. 24 At trial, an empaneled judge snidely remarked on Wilders’ intent to remain silent. An immediate appeal to replace the biased panel was denied. 25 Dutch prosecutors then reiterated the legality of criticizing religion (Muslim feelings determine no “facts of the case”), but trial judges ignored their request to acquit on all five charges.26 After incontestable judicial bias surfaced, however, a new appeals court on Oct. 22 terminated the Wilders trial. At a private May 2010 dinner party, Islamic expert and defense witness Hans Jansen revealed, magistrate Tom Schalken (among the Amsterdam judges to order Wilders’ prosecution) had approached to explain why Wilders must be prosecuted. Schalken’s unlawfully expressed, extra-judicial comment to a defense witness forced the appeals justices to order a new Wilders trial.27 Next up was Austria’s Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff, Pax Europa‘s Austrian representative and a former Organization for Security and Co-operation envoy in Europe. Pax Europa, focusing on sharia law incursions and simultaneous erosion of free speech in Europe, is Germany’s “foremost human rights organization,” she says. 28 In Sept. 2010, Sabaditsch-Wolff learned she was accused of “defamation of religion” during a 2009 three-part seminar on “Islamization of Europe” for the Freedom Education Institute (FEI). She is not a member of FEI or any part of the late, controversial Joerg Haider‘s “far-right” Austrian Freedom Party. But even if Sabaditsch-Wolff did belong, it would not be criminal: the state gives public monies to the Austrian Freedom Party’s Institute. Moreover, Sabaditsch-Wolff based her academic observations on experience gained, by choice, from living most of her adult life “in Arab and Muslim-majority countries.” Exactly which statements prompted Vienna’s prosecutor to indict her for hate speech, he did not see fit to specify. 29 She was “tried” in Vienna, if you can call it that, in Nov. 2010. No decision has yet been announced. That same month, the European Union required member states to implement the “Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia,” a measure adopted Nov. 28, 2008 to combat “certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law.” This EU legal provision required all EU member states to comply fully by Nov. 28, 2010, Sabaditsch-Wolff asserts, and punish “intentional conduct” considered a pretext to target “a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.” 30 Oblique or not, this means Muslims. Who passed these measures, at whose proposal, without consulting Europe’s parliaments or populaces — and whether are they binding under national constitutions — should immediately arise as critical topics of debate in all EU member states. And Americans, lest we think ourselves immune, should steel the ramparts for the continuing onslaught upon our own treasured rights to free speech. Despite our new Free Speech protection measure, free speech remains under barrage assault.

Lappen on January 18, 2011 at 10:43 | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0) Tweet This! | The Muslim Brotherhood Path to Victory: parts 2 & 3 (of 3) By Rachel Ehrenfeld Funding the Movement For the past five decades most funding to MB-affiliated organizations around the world – especially those involved directly in terrorist activities – has come from oil rich  countries in the Middle East. However the MB Palestinian branch, Hamas, designated as a terrorist organization by the E.U. and U.S., seems to derive large sums of money from the EU, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), and even the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).   In fact, the world community facilitated Hamas' victory in the 2006 Palestinian Authority election, when it allowed Hamas to run under the name  "List of Change and Reform."  In June 2007, Hamas took control over the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority (PA).   Since then, despite repeated promises to cut off funds to Hamas, international aid organizations and many countries have continued funneling money to Gaza, purportedly for humanitarian aid, but more recently to fund the “Gaza Administration.”   Hamas’ rule over Gaza does not seem to be an obstacle to funding it. International aid organizations, the EU, and USAID, rely on the U.S. list of designated terrorists. The Treasury Department lists Hamas and its many organizations on its  Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN). However, its list from January 6, 2011, named only the  Damascus-based Hamas Diplomatic Bureau official Moussa Abu-Marzuk, as a terrorist. Incredibly no other Hamas leader was identified on the list – not even  the head of the organization, Khaled Mashal .    In 2009, following Israel’s operation Cast Lead to stop Hamas & Islamic Jihad rockets attacks on Israel, the European Commission pledged at least  $554 to Gaza in “humanitarian aid.” Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE promised billions more.  But these wealthy Arab nations are known to  renege on their financial aid to the Palestinians, including Hamas. Their promises get them lots of publicity, while they let the West foot the bill.   For example, an October 2010 Foreign Policy article reported that “Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani,  pledged $30 million for U.N. humanitarian operations in Gaza… the money has  never arrived.”   However, UNWRA does not rely only on pledges. The UN agency raises money for Gaza through its Web site, with payments going through WorldPay (part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group), the Arab Bank PLC in Gaza and HSBC in Amman, Jordan. Those funds come in addition to UNRWA's annual budget of $400 million.   The London-based Palestinians Relief and Development Fund, better known as  Interpal, was outlawed by Israel in  1997, and  designated by the United States as a supporter of terrorism in 2003. Despite mountains of evidence, Interpal used a well-oiled propaganda machine (and apparently Gordon Brown’s Palestinian leaning government) to  escape unscathed from a UK inquiry into its Hamas ties in 2009. An earlier investigation in 1996 similarly  exonerated the group, despite its  open affiliations with the  Qaradawi-led  Union of Good, an umbrella group of over 50 charities that funnels money to Hamas. The U.S. only designated the Union of Good as a terrorist entity in  2008.   The Palestinian Return Centre  (PRC) is another  MB offshoot that operates throughout Europe from its base in Britain. Israel  banned the PRC on December 27, 2010, because of its involvement “in initiating and organizing radical and violent activity against Israel in Europe, while de-legitimizing Israel's status as a nation among the European community. For example,  in 2008, the PRC hosted its sixth Palestinians in Europe conference in Denmark’s capital  Copenhagen, featuring a video address by Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and  appearances by Raid Salah, the head of the Islamic movement in Israel, and the former head of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammad Akram al-Adlouni.   The same Danish leadership that allowed the PRC conference is now prosecuting  Lars Hedegaard, the President of the Danish Free Press Society and The International Free Press Society.   PRC  co-founded the European Campaign to End the Siege on Gaza (ECESG), an entity  established by MB’s European umbrella organizations, the Federation of Islamic Organisations in Europe (FIO). ECESG helped coordinate the Gaza flotilla affair in 2010, which ended in some casualties and fatalities after members of another MB ‘humanitarian’ organization – Turkish Humanitarian Relief (IHH) --  attacked Israeli soldiers who boarded to prevent the boat from breaking the blockade around Gaza. Israel  banned the IHH in 2008 for its links to Hamas and the Union of Good, and  recently asked the United States to follow suit. The Obama Administration is taking its time.   Dr. Arafat Madi heads  both PRC and ECESG, which share office space and a telephone number. PRC’s leadership reads like a who’s who of Hamas and MB membership, including Zaher Birawi. Birawi is the former chairman of the MB-linked Muslim Association of Britain, a trustee of a Union of Good’s member organization,  Education Aid for Palestine (EAP), and the  current spokesman for George Galloway’s Viva Palestina, among other associations; Ghassan Faour, associated with Interpal; and Majdi Akeel, who was identified as a Hamas activist in the Holy Land Foundation case. The list goes on.   In spite of these radical associations, the ECESG website  lists numerous supporters among members of the UK government and elsewhere. In January 2010, ECESG arranged for a  50-person delegation of current and former MPs and politicians to travel to Gaza. The delegation met with Ismail Haniya, the head of Hamas’s so-called political wing in Gaza, John Ging, the Director of Operations for the UN Relief and Works Agency, and others. Last year, PRC and ECESG head Madi reportedly  discussed Israel policy in Gaza with the President of the European Parliament. International Influence   Britain’s willful blindness to the Muslim Brotherhood’s subversive agenda, and its acquiescence to its vitriolic propaganda is not merely a local disease. The international tentacles of the MB assist the organization to infect other countries. Unfortunately the United States seems to follow in the footsteps of England, unwisely ignoring the growing influence of the MB in its borders.   Despite  renewed attention in recent years on Muslim Brotherhood affiliated groups operating in the U.S. radical Islamic organizations disguised as “ mainstream Muslims” are now  presenting their Islamic agenda to the  government and appear on a regular basis in the  media. These groups  include the Council on Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Muslim Students Association (MSA), the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), the Muslim American Society (MAS), Islamic Society of North America ( ISNA) and the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT), and the Muslim Youth of North America (MYNA).   CAIR’s terror ties have long been confirmed in numerous court cases, the most recent of which is the Holy Land Foundation (HLF) case of 2009, which exposed HLF as a Hamas fundraising front.   During the HLF trial, the FBI identified CAIR as part of the  Muslim Brotherhood’s Palestinian Committee, which was  tasked with funneling financial support to Hamas, and obstructing prospective peace deals in the Middle East.     The FBI also listed CAIR’s co-founders,  Omar Ahmad and Nihad Awad, as members of the MB Palestine Committee. Ahmad and Awad formerly headed another member organization of the Palestinian Committee, the Islamic Association for Palestine. Now defunct, IAP was shut down following  a civil suit against it and other HAMAS fundraising entities by the family of an American teenager murdered by terrorists in the West Bank. Ahmad left CAIR leadership in 2005, with the title of “ chairman emeritus,” but his  biographical information is  no longer available on CAIR’s website, as is  Nihad Awad’s, one of CAIR’s founders and its current Executive Director.   At least  15 other CAIR officials have been identified in terror investigations, including  Ghassan Elashi, also a founding member, who was involved in the HLF case.   Despite criminal ties, known connections to the American ‘ Wahhabi lobby,” and blatant MB affiliations, CAIR continue to boasts its reputation as the preeminent Muslim civil rights group in the U.S. The group is linked with the highest level of government. For instance, in  1997, Awad was appointed by Vice President Al Gore as a member of the Civil Rights Advisory Panel to the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. According to CAIR’s website,  he is also “a regular participant in the U.S. Department of State’s “International Visitors Program”, which welcomes foreign dignitaries, journalists and academics who are currently visiting the President of the United States.”     Like CAIR, ISNA, another  unindicted co-conspirator in the HLF case has been warmly embraced by the Obama Administration. ISNA President  Ingrid Mattson has spoken at various White House functions, including the presidential inauguration, and was invited to join the White House Council on Women and Girls. In February 2010, another  ISNA member, Eboo Patel, was appointed to the President’s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood partnerships.   ISNA has hosted multiple conferences at which speakers and released publications that supported jihad, terrorism and radical Islam, documented in a recent  report by the Investigative Project on Terrorism.  ISNA has been  described as “one of the chief conduits through which the radical Saudi form of Islam passes in the United States.” Among its many functions, this powerful group holds the deed to anywhere from  50% to 80% of the mostly  Saudi funded mosques in the United States through its affiliate organization, NAIT.   ISNA was the  primary endorser of imams assigned to federal prisons until the federal Bureau of Prisons suspended it  in 2003, when the FBI conducted investigations unto ISNA’s terror ties. ISNA’s former chaplain-endorsing agent,  Dr. Louay Safi, is affiliated with the  terror-linked IIIT, an organization that has close ties with both Anwar and Qaradawi. Safi was also an unindicted co-conspirator in the trial of Sami Al-Arian, who was convicted of fundraising for terrorist group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Safi was an  instructor to Major Nidal Malik Hassan, at the Fort hood military base, where Hassan  massacred 13 people on the in 2009, yelling “Allahu Akbar.”      Yusuf al-Qaradawi.   As of December 2010, ISNA was  listed as one of the two organizations that vets Muslim chaplains in the American military.   And there’s more.  ISNA is part of the Coordinating Council of Muslim Organizations (CCMO), another MB affiliated organization in the United States that included terror-tied groups such as CAIR,  IIT, the  Dar al Hijrah Mosque, and  MPAC. According to  Bigpeace.com, the Obama administration reportedly hosted a group from CCMO in 2010 in order to teach participant groups how to “cut through red tape” to “receive direct access” to “funding, government assistance and resources.” News of the financial workshop made the press not because the Obama Administration reported about it, as transparent government should have done,  but because an  ISNA e-mail leaked.   The West’s response to Anwar and Qaradawi is par for the course in its approach to the MB’s rapidly growing and metastasizing tentacles. Despite the vast MB infrastructure in the U.S. and the UK, both countries are turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the growing incitement and activities of their homegrown Islamist organizations.   Qaradawi remains a worldwide media figure with access to students at some of the most prestigious American universities. In  January 2009, Qatar’s mouthpiece Al Jazeera, aired one of many similar Qaradawi speeches in which he said:   “Throughout history, Allah has imposed upon the [Jews] people who would punish them for their corruption. The last punishment was carried out by Hitler. By means of all the things he did to them – even though they exaggerated this issue – he managed to put them in their place. This was divine punishment for them. Allah willing, the next time will be at the hand of the believers."   Qaradawi concluded:   "The only thing I hope for is that as my life approaches its end, Allah will give me an opportunity to go to the land of Jihad and resistance, even if in a wheelchair. I will shoot Allah’s enemies, the Jews, and they will throw a bomb at me, and thus, I will seal my life with martyrdom. Praise be to Allah." Qaradawi’s radical views did not deter Prominent British Labor party politician and former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone from welcoming Qaradawi into City Hall, in July 2004. Livingstone lavishly praised Qaradawi and compared his scholarly rank to “the position of Pope John XXIII.” Livingstone also opined that Qaradawi is “an absolutely sane Islamist.”   Qaradawi, who is Sunni, also defends Shiite Iran. In 2007, he  stated that Muslims should mobilize internationally to “resist any possibly attack the US might launch against Iran. Iran is a Muslim country which all Muslims should defend while the US is an enemy of Islam that has already declared war on Islam under the disguise of war on terrorism…”   But such statements do not offend MB apologist John Esposito.  The director of Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University, Esposito is also closely affiliated with Anwar Ibrahim, the Honorary President of the Center.  In 2006, Anwar was a  Distinguished Visiting Professor in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.     Esposito describes Qaradawi as a “moderate” who represents "a cross section of Muslim thinkers, religious leaders and mainstream Islamic movements from Egypt to Indonesia, Europe to America." Furthermore he praises Qaradawi for his "reformist interpretation of Islam and its relationship to democracy, pluralism and human rights."   Esposito’s ruthless laundry of Qaradawi’s anti-American and anti-Semitic views seems to work. A 2008  Foreign Policy Magazine poll ranked Qaradawi third on a list of the world’s top twenty public intellectuals.   On December 30, 2010, days before Sudan’s referendum on Southern Sudan’s secession, the “moderate” Qaradawi  charged that the election was part of a Western plot orchestrated to weaken the Muslim world.   The well-oiled MB propaganda machine has succeeded in portraying the most radical, anti- American, anti-West and anti- Semitic Islamic organizations and leaders as “moderate” Muslims and reformers. How much longer can the West afford to ignore the Muslim Brotherhood’s efforts to replace Western democracy and capitalism with the oppression of the Islamic Caliphate?   FamilySecurityMatters.org  Contributing Editor Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld  is the Director of the New York-based American Center for Democracy. She is an expert on terrorism and corruption-related topics such as terror financing and narco-terrorism.

Following Sheikh Ali Al-Hudaify, imam of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina call " upon governments, organizations and scholars in the Islamic world to extend support for campaigns protesting the sacrilegious attacks on the Prophet,” the MB orchestrated mass riots in Denmark and across the world.   Responding to an interviewer question on Muslim “honor killings,” Mr. Hedegaard remarked, “They rape their own children.” He now stands accused by Denmark’s public prosecutor of “racism.”   Although Mr. Hedegaard further explained that he was not speaking about every single Muslim or even the majority, the prosecution is proceeding. His trial begins later this month.   The politically correct sensitivity of the Danish public prosecutor that led to Mr. Hedegaard’s prosecution and persecution seems to follow the cowardly public apology issued by the Danish daily Politiken on February 2010, for reprinting the cartoons in 2008. The newspaper’s mea culpa was obtained as part of the settlement with a Saudi lawyer representing 94,923 of Muhammad's descendants, who sued the paper for offending them.   Hedegaard’s legal troubles and Politiken’s cave-in are the casualties of the global propaganda offensive launched after 9/11, portraying the Muslims as victims of discrimination by Western societies. Led by the Muslim Brotherhood, this offensive drastically intensified after the publications of the Muhammad cartoons in Denmark and Sweden.   Ironically, while Europe is obstinately ignoring or kowtowing the growing power of radical Islam and the MB, State Department communications revealed by Wikileaks in November and December 2010 show that Arab leaders in the Middle East have voiced increasing alarm at the spread of the MB’s radical Islamic worldview is spreading.   A March 3, 2008 cable quoted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali predicting an MB takeover in Egypt, where, he noted, the environment was “explosive.”  This view was confirmed in a February 23, 2010 cable quoting the Qatari Emir, Hamid bin Khalifa al Thani, telling U.S. Senator John Kerry, “Everyone knows that Egypt has a problem with the Muslim Brotherhood.” Another cable revealed an allegedly reluctant association between MB offshoot Hamas and Syrian President Bashar Assad. Calling the terrorist group an “ uninvited guest,” Assad insisted that “to be effective and active,” he nonetheless had to “have a relationship with all parties. Hamas is Muslim Brotherhood, but we have to deal with the reality of their presence.”   The Muslim Brotherhood proudly touts these accomplishments on their official website, Ikhanweb.     The Wikileaks cables show that MB’s long-advertised aspirations of global control are materializing, fueled by Saudi and Gulf petrodollars and influence, with the complicity and tacit approval of the West.     Sayyid Qutb   The MB describes itself as a political and social revolutionary movement; it was founded in March 1928 in Egypt by Hassan al-Banna, who objected to Western influence and together with MB’s most influential ideologues Sayyid Qutb , called for return to the earliest days of Islam as a model for society. MB is an expansive and secretive society with followers in more than 70 countries, dedicated to creating a global Islamic order that would discriminate against women and punish nonbelievers. Its members and supporters founded and funded al Qaeda, Hamas, and other radical Muslim terror groups, as well as Muslim student organizations on six continents, including one “of the largest college student groups in the United States.”   The case of the Egyptian exiled Doha based, 85 year-old MB spiritual leader, Yusuf Qaradawi, amply demonstrates how a well-funded Islamist demagogue who openly calls for violence against Americans, Israelis, and Jews, has managed nonetheless to secure a reputation in the West as a moderate thinker.   A prolific writer, who for decades holds the directorship of Qatar University's Seerah and Sunnah Centre, Qaradawi is hailed as one of the leading modern Islamic scholars. He is the founder of the International Union of Muslim Scholars and the European Council for Fatwa and Research, and was twice offered the leadership of the MB. He rejected the offers, explaining in 2004 that he could not commit to “any movement which might constrain my actions, even if this is the Muslim Brotherhood under whose umbrella I grew and which I so defended.” In 2006 he clarified that the although the MB consider him  “their Mufti” but that he “prefer[ed] to be devoted to the entire nation.” Qaradawi was banned from entering the U.S. in 1999.   Adhering to the MB ideology, which calls on the Muslims to rid themselves of non-Islamic rule, Qaradawi has advocated suicide bombing as “ martyrdom in the name of God,” and the killing of American and coalition troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2004, he issued a fatwa forbidding Muslims from buying or even advertising American or Israeli products. Qaradawi issues many fatwas on his popular website www.qaradawi.net; on another website he helped found in 1997, IslamOnline, as well as on his al Jazeera prime-time television program, ash-Shariah wal-Hayat, “Shariah and Life,” allegedly reaching 40 million viewers. Wikileaks cables confirmed that Qatar uses the Doha-based al Jazeera as “a useful tool” to advance its political agenda. Another recent example of the Qaradawi-Qatari partnership to increase Islamic influence and expand its reach is found in the Qatar Foundation’s Education City, a multi-billion mega-complex housing a combination of Qatari and prestigious American institutions.     Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani   The Qatar Foundation was established by Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar in 1995, and is currently headed by his wife, Shikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al-Missned. American universities lured to Qatar by massive financial incentives include Carnegie Mellon, Northwestern, Texas A&M, Georgetown, Virginia Commonwealth, and Cornell. For instance, the Qatar Foundation covers the costs of A&M at Education City, and pledged $750 million to the branch of Cornell’s medical college. Qatar continues its effort to attract additional prominent American and European academic institutions.   Education City is now home to the Qaradawi Center for Islamic Moderation and Renewal, an Islamic Studies think tank whose establishment is aimed to “ highlight the middle path propagated by Qaradawi.” In the 2009/2010 academic year the Qatar Foundation awarded five graduate scholarships in Qaradawi’s name for applicants studying Islamic Studies with a specialty in Contemporary Fiqh (Islamic Law). In 2009, Qaradawi was on a roster of prominent Middle Easter figures who lectured to American students participating in “Journalism Boot Camp,” a program affiliated with Columbia University, the University of Qatar, and the American University of Cairo.   Clearly, Qaradawi’s ubiquitous presence in Qatar and its rapidly growing Education City, is not dissuading American institutions of higher learning from exposing American students to Qaradawi’s poisonous influence.   Qatar’s substantial financial and ideological support for Qaradawi, helps to promote the Muslim Brotherhood’s agenda. In February 2009, Qaradawi thanked Qatar “for having accepted me and allowed me to do my work on an international scale. I have never faced any obstacle in expressing freely whatever I wished.”   Qatari money and academic ties provide but one of many means for the spread of Muslim Brotherhood influence, which is becoming pervasive in the Western world, which allows the burgeoning network of Islamic organizations and charities to operate.   In order to understand the scope of MB operations in the West, one must first understand the organization’s long-term planning and methods to secure their growth. MB’s founder Hassan al-Banna, understood that financial strength was critical for the organization’s success, weapon to undermine the infidels — and “work towards establishing an Islamic rule on earth.”   After the 1973 successful use of Middle East oil as a weapon against the West, rising oil revenues encouraged MB leaders to formalize al-Banna's vision. In 1977 and 1982, they convened in Lugano, Switzerland, to chart a master plan to co-opt Western economic “foundations, capitalism and democracy” in a treatise entitled “Towards a Worldwide Strategy for Islamic Policy,” also known as The Project. MB spiritual leader al-Qaradawi wrote the explicit document, dated 1 December 1982.The 12-point strategy includes diktats to establish the Islamic state and gradual, parallel work to control local power centers . . . using institutional work as means to this end. To achieve all these to spread fundamentalist Islam required “special Islamic economic, social and other institutions,” and “the necessary economic institutions to provide financial support.”     Anwar Ibrahim   But Islamic banking was slow to catch on until 1993, when Anwar Ibrahim—then Malaysia’s finance minister, and current opposition leader—helped to introduce the newly invented “Islamic Banking windows” into conventional banks. This measure helped familiarized potential customers with and built confidence in the unknown Islamic banking system. Indeed, it proved central to the development of the global Islamic finance industry. Anwar constant support and advocacy of Islamic rule led Qaradawi, his friend and business partner, to join the list of prominent Western leaders who publically defend the Malay politician, who is on trial for sodomy and corruption charges, which he denies.    Anwar and Qaradawi share substantial business ties: in 1996, Anwar licensed company headed by Qaradawi and transferred it to Malaysia. The company, Majestic Global Investment is Kuwaiti fund management business. Both Anwar and Qaradawi serve on the board of the MB affiliated, Virginia based International Institute for Islamic Thought (IIIT), which Anwar helped to found.   The IIIT, which has been under extended federal investigation for ties to al Qaeda and Hamas, advertises two of Qaradawi’s books, and has published literature describing the hurdles it faces in its planned takeover of the U.S. and Canada.   Qaradawi and Anwar share ties to Oxford University. Qaradawi is a trustee of the university’s Center for Islamic Studies, while Anwar was a lecturer at Oxford’s St. Antony’s College.   Another Western media darling, Tariq Ramadan, who is prominent advocate of the MB agenda, found a permanent house at Oxford’s St. Antony’s College. Ramadan, Hassan al Banna’s grandson, was banned from entering the U.S. until January 19, 2010, when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, issued an executive order allowing his entry to the country. Clinton who pressured the Malaysian government on behalf of Anwar, considers him a reformer and an exemplary moderate Muslim.    One can only wonder why despite the readily available damning information and r enewed attention on the MB and its affiliated groups the U.S. as its allies are laying the welcoming carpet to some of the most effective MB actors.   First published in FamilySecurityMatters.org Contributing Editor Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld  is the Director of the New York-based American Center for Democracy.

Wikileaks has shed new light on the Obama administration's diplomatic activities on this crisis. According to Wikileaks cables, in  December 2009, the U.S. warned Sudan to stop transshipments of Iranian arms to Hamas in Gaza for use against Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The cables however, did not discuss that Sudan was also transferring Iranian arms to the Taliban in Afghanistan to kill American and coalition forces. Other Sudan related Wikileaks-released  cables from the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, reported that in 2009, the Obama Administration threatened Kenya with "sweeping sanctions" if it delivered the shipload of weapons, including 32 tanks that were recovered from Somali pirates, to their rightful owner, the Southern Sudanese government . The tanks remained in Kenya. This new policy contravened the Bush Administration's 2008 plan to convert the Southern Sudanese People's Liberation Army from a guerrilla outfit to a small conventional army capable of defending Juba, the capital of the South. Nonetheless, the Obama Administration continued the efforts to make Southern Sudan a viable state. On December  20 th, the White House declared that it had " intense interest in having a successful referendum." The decision to stop the arms  shipment and the tanks from reaching the Southern Sudanese so they could defend themselves from the heavily armed Northern Sudanese army, raises the question , who in Washington sets the U.S. policy towards Sudan? Southern Sudan, a mostly Christian region, could soon gain its independence from the U.S. terrorist designated Islamic Republic of Sudan and its ruler the internationally indicted and wanted war criminal, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. The Obama Administration's  concessions to Bashir made possible the  independence referendum scheduled on Jan. 9, that would lead to Southern Sudan's independence in July 2011. Publically, the concessions include the removal of Sudan from the U.S. list of terrorism-sponsoring states, ending the sanctions against the country, and allowing negotiations for economic assistance, including debt relief.  The Administration first announced this development in June 2010. It is unclear what guarantees were given to Bashir, who in July 2008 was charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes by the  International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague, and has two international arrest warrants against him. Moreover, according to a  Wikileaks-released State Department cable , in March 2009, ICC chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, informed the U.S. that Bashir stashed " possibly $9 billion" in banks outside Sudan. If the past is any indication, reading The New York Times  (NYT)  gives the impression that Bashir will likely be celebrated  as a reformer by the Obama Administration.  On  July 13, 2010, The NYT updated its "people" information with the following: "Mr. Bashir has been  vilified ....[and]  suspected of war crimes... [and] often  perceived as a villain in the West" (emphasis added). But, Mr. Bashir, according to the NYT, enjoys "strong support from voters in northern Sudan" because under his leadership Sudan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) "has nearly tripled."  However, The NYT did not mention that the northern Sudanese  "voters" are Muslims cowed by the military dictatorship, and that the new Sudanese wealth comes from oil exports, from which Bashir has pocketed some $9 billion. Bashir will not be the first murderer and thief to benefit by promising peace to an American Administration. Yasser Arafat, an internationally wanted terrorist for decades, who ordered the killing of American diplomats and who incredibly stashed away more than  $10 billion, (part of which was international aid money to the Palestinian refugees) received  the Nobel Peace Prize in  1994, just because he promised "peace." Is Bashir next? Last week, in its end of the year report, Israel's  Security Agency detailed Sudan's on-going facilitation of transshipment of Iranian weapons to Hamas. Clearly, the 2009  U.S. warning failed to deter the Sudanese government. Days before the referendum, there are two unknowns: will Bashir accept the results, and judging by the Obama Administration's shifting policies regarding Sudan, how will the U.S. react if Bashir rejects the results? Stay tuned.   Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld, Director of the NY based  American Center for Democracy , and author of  Funding Evil ; How Terrorism is Financed - and How to Stop It.   Posted by Rachel Ehrenfeld on January 06, 2011 at 07:28 | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0) Tweet This! | Obama's Israel Policy by Rachel Ehrenfeld Jan 5th 2011   The United States’ withdrawal of its demand that Israel impose a second construction freeze in order to bring the Palestinian Authority (PA) back to the negotiation table does not necessarily indicate that the Obama Administration now sides with Israel. Moreover, America’s latest move will likely result in the Administration’s abstaining from a vote on a much-rumored possible U.N. Security Council resolution recognizing the unilateral declaration of an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders. The U.S. House of Representatives’ resolution last month urged the Administration to “deny any unilaterally declared Palestinian state” and “veto any resolution by the United Nations Security Council to establish or recognize a Palestinian state outside of an agreement negotiated by the two parties.” However, this resolution is unlikely to stop the Administration from either supporting or abstaining from a vote on a Palestinian initiated resolution “declaring ongoing Jewish settlement in the West Bank a big obstacle to ending the conflict.” America’s withdrawing the demand that Israel freezes building in “disputed territories,” also means that the Obama Administration will not sell $3 billion worth of 20 radar-evading F-35 fighter jets to Israel. This will weaken the Jewish State’s ability to defend itself. Further destabilizing the region, and diminishing Israel’s military edge, is the U.S. sale of $97 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. While the U.S. is considering its next step, the European Union is inching closer to recognizing a Palestinian state. “We welcome the World Bank’s assessment that “if the Palestinian Authority maintains its current performance in institution building and public services, it is well positioned for the establishment of a state at any point in the near future.”" The December 13, 2010, 3058th meeting of the European Union Foreign Affairs Council concluded: “The EU recalls that peace in the Middle East should be comprehensive and reiterates the importance of negotiations on the Israel-Syria and Israel-Lebanon tracks. Incredibly, the Council also stated: “Peace should lead to the full integration of Israel in its regional environment (emphasis added) along the lines set out in the Arab Peace Initiative,” clearly ignoring Israel’s unique identity, its raison d’être as the Jewish State. Another sign of Obama’s Administration growing distance from Israel is the U.S.  silence in the face of  mounting South American support for a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian independent state. Over the course of December 2010, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Ecuador – eagerly recognized an independent Palestinian state. Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay will reportedly be the next to join their neighbors in recognizing the PA as an independent state. Rather than lobbying South American regimes to withhold or retract recognition, the U.S. has only criticized the moves as counterproductive to a negotiated peace between Israel and the PA. This South American initiative emerged following  the July 2010  State Department’s upgrade of the Washington DC Palestinian Liberation Organization’s mission status, a move that allows the PLO office to fly the Palestinian flag. While the EU declined to recognize a Palestinian state outright in December, several member states– France, Spain, Portugal and Norway – have upgraded the status of PLO representation in their countries, as have Canada.  Britain was considering a similar move at the end of December. Remarkably, neither the EU Council, nor the South American countries have discussed the Gaza Strip, which is included in the ‘67 borders, though the terrorist group Hamas rules it. Meanwhile Hamas is gaining strength in the PA controlled West Bank. Hamas major arms supplier is Iran. The arms are transited through Sudan and the Egyptian controlled Sinai Peninsula. Last summer, the U.S. warned Sudan to stop the Iranian arms transfer to Hamas, but the arms continue to flow. At the same time, both the PA and Hamas continue to call for the eradication of Israel. PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas continue to present maps of “Palestine” that make no mention of Israel, while Hamas leaders continue to insist: “We retain our Islamic, Arab and Palestinian faith that Palestine will be returned to its inhabitants and Zionist existence will conclude….The Jews will have no right there, save for those who lived on Palestinian land prior to the First World War.” But such expressions to not seem to discourage the Administration from deploying former diplomats to hold discussions with Hamas. It is unknown whether the Administration’s behavior towards Israel is influenced by Obama’s inaugural promise to the Muslim world: “we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest…” However, recent developments should raise grave concerns in Israel and among its friends and all freedom loving Americans.

'We're terrified; we have no shelters,' resident says Ynet reporters Published: 01.31.11, 22:48 / Israel News Tensions in Egypt appear to be spreading to Gaza: Grad rockets fired from the Hamas-ruled territory Monday night landed near the southern Israeli cities of Ofakim and Netivot. During the rocket attack on Netivot- the first attack on Israel since the mass protests against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak began a week ago – four people suffered from shock, and damage was caused to a road and a parked car. The rocket landed near a residential neighborhood. Another Grad hit the Ofakim area a few minutes later, but there were no reports of injury or damage. Posted by Yoni Tidi at 02:16 PM | Permalink Israel agrees to some Egyptian troops in Sinai As anti-Mubarak protests rage on, Israel allows two Egyptian battalions - about 800 soldiers - into Sharm el-Sheikh area for first time since 1979 peace treaty. Officials: Move aimed at preventing arms smuggling to Gaza Associated Press Published: 01.31.11, 17:07 / Israel News Israeli officials said Monday that they have agreed to let Egypt move several hundred troops into the Sinai Peninsula for the first time since the countries reached peace three decades ago. With street protests threatening the Egyptian regime, the officials say that Israel allowed the Egyptian army to move two battalions - about 800 soldiers - into Sinai on Sunday. The officials said the troops were based in the Sharm el-Sheikh area on Sinai's southern tip, far from Israel. This is the wrong move. Israel has jumped when it should have waited to see what the outcome of the unrest in Egypt will be. Israel has now allowed Egyptian troops to move into the Sinai, how can we say no if they want to move in with more troops? Israel should have moved into the Sinai with the IDF to stop smuggling of weapons into Gaza. Posted by Yoni Tidi at 11:48 AM | Permalink January 30, 2011 Rutgers bars Jews from anti-Zionist gathering (pro-Israel programs planned) #1 BRAVE NEW SCHOOLS Rutgers bars Jews from anti-Zionist gathering Public event suddenly closed to all but supporters by campus police By Alyssa Farah WorldNetDaily Posted: January 29, 2011 :10 pm Eastern http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=257241#ixzz1CUykzRmC NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. – Rutgers University campus police tonight barred some 400 Jewish students and their supporters, including some Holocaust survivors, from attending what was billed as an anti-Zionist gathering at the state school tonight. The student-sponsored event was announced with an open invitation campus-wide, and Rutgers policy is for all student activities to be open to the public. However, when the sponsoring organizations of "Never Again for Anyone" saw they were outnumbered by Jewish students and their supporters by about 4-to-1, they asked campus policy to bar students wearing kippas – and eventually limited attendance to known supporters of the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, Americans for Muslims in Palestine and the Middle East Children's Alliance. Never again? "The Forgotten People: Christianity and the Holocaust." It's a provocative, compelling, educational tool for the whole family available in the WND Superstore. Pleas to university officials from the Jewish students and their supporters for access to the event went unheeded. "They started charging money as soon as they saw Zionists outside," said Rabbi Akiva Weiss. Rutgers campus police said they could not provide a statement as to why the public event would turn away 400 members of the public. One officer said they were called in late and weren't really sure what was going on. When the Jewish students, led by Aaron Marcus, were denied entry, they gathered in the lobby and sang religious songs in Hebrew. "We wanted to protest this event because as the children and grandchildren of victims of the Holocaust we believed it to be absolutely absurd to compare Israeli act of self defense to the viscous, systematic murder of millions of Jews, Catholics, Gays, Gypsies, Russians and others," Marcus said. Members of the New Jersey branch of Young Americans for Freedom were in attendance to protest the discrimination against Jewish students. The program at Rutgers is part of a national tour purporting to promote peace and justice for Israel and surrounding lands. ==== Alyssa Farah is a WND editorial assistant. #2 Federations aid Rutgers Hillel's pro-Israel efforts Debra Rubin NJJN Bureau Chief/Middlesex The Jewish Exponent January 27, 2011 http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/22770/ Rutgers Hillel executive director Andrew Getraer said, "We need to combat this extremism and delegitimization of Israel." The state's Jewish federations have pledged $10,000 to Rutgers Hillel for a series of pro-Israel events. Aimed as a response in part to recent pro-Palestinian activities on campus, the events will include a Jan. 31 forum on United States-Israel relations featuring Reps. Frank Pallone (D-Dist. 6) and Leonard Lance (R-Dist. 7) and Israeli deputy consul general Shlomi Kofman. The events are intended to highlight Israel's democratic values and the country's importance to the United States and New Jersey as a trading partner and ally. "We have pledged to help them, and our immediate concern is providing support for its Israel advocacy program," said Jacob Toporek, the executive director of the New Jersey State Association of Jewish Federations. "We've had conversations with someone from the governor's office about what's happening. We are involved and we are engaged." The Jewish Federation of Greater Middlesex County is commiting $2,000 towards the Israel advocacy program for the spring semester. "We feel strongly that we need to provide the resources for our students to respond effectively and immediately," said Gerrie Bamira, the Middlesex federation's executive director. The partnership announced on Jan. 25 is one component of a campaign to counter a series of events organized by BAKA: Students United for Middle Eastern Justice, a Rutgers University student organization. BAKA has supported efforts to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza, holding events that have featured nationally prominent speakers deeply critical of Israel and its role in May's deadly flotilla incident. The latest event -- cosponsored by BAKA, Journalists for Human Rights, and Psi Sigma Phi men's multi-cultural fraternity -- was held Jan. 20 on the College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick to commemorate the second anniversary of the "Gaza massacres" during Operation Cast Lead. It drew 54 people, according to the campus newspaper, The Daily Targum. In December, a "Palestine Culture Festival" was held on the university's Douglass campus to raise money for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund of Rutgers University. It featured a panel discussion on the Gaza conflict and was cosponsored by the Arab Cultural Club, BAKA, and the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. "We need to combat this extremism and delegitimization of Israel," Hillel's executive director, Andrew Getraer, told NJJN. "We are once again being targeted as we were last semester where it seemed as if there was an anti-Israel event every week or at least every other week." Toporek said the association asked Getraer to speak to a meeting of federation executives in December about the Mideast debate on campus, after which they voted unanimously that advocacy "should take a higher priority." Hillel was also asked to submit a three-year plan and budget for its pro-Israel campaign, which is being reviewed. 'Morally outrageous' The first counter event, featuring Lance and Pallone, is billed as a Rutgers University student leadership dinner. Scarlet Blue and White, a student organization launched last semester as a multi-ethnic and religious pro-Israel student coalition, is sponsoring the event along with Rutgers Hillel, the State Association, the Jewish Federation of Central New Jersey, and the Jewish Federation of Greater Middlesex County. "Hillel is a great organization, but obviously we're all Jews," Liran Kapoano, a senior history and political science major from Somerset and a founder and president of Scarlet Blue and White. "I wanted to do something that was religion neutral." Kapoano said the student organization is also planning an event featuring American politicians with expertise in science and technology to speak to students on how Israeli trade and technological advancements benefit the American economy. Kapoano welcomed the assistance of the State Association, which has helped him make connections with political and Jewish community leaders. Getraer is concerned about another event to be held on Jan. 29 on the Douglass Campus, sponsored by American Muslims for Palestine, the International Anti-Zionist Jewish Network, and the Middle East Children's Alliance. The program, Never Again for Anyone, is being held in conjunction with the United Nations International Day of Holocaust Remembrance. "They will have speakers who will equate Israel's treatment of Palestinians to the Holocaust and genocide, which is morally outrageous," said Getraer. "It not only trivializes the victims of a true genocide, the Holocaust, but it defames the Jewish State of Israel and the Jewish people."

Something is happening and it has the possibility of being a game changer. Too long America has backed evil tyrants in exchange for cheap oil, that may be coming to an end. The people rise up and the tyrant is gone, more than likely they will meet an end similar to the Romanov's . But then what? Do the people of Egypt, Tunisia,Jordan,Lebanon and Yemen take to the streets to demand Jeffersonian democracy or do they just want to get rid of the tyrants. It is clear to me they just want to get rid of the tyrants . If these countries rid themselves of their tyrants look for the Saudi's and oil emirates to also go. In Egypt the military may take over running the government, only because the Muslim Brotherhood may feel they are better off in some sort of power sharing with the army. But make no mistake in all of these governments in the end these countries will be ruled by Islamic fundamentalist allies of Iran. This would be a huge game changer for both the USA and Israel. For America it will mean the end of relatively cheap oil and this would have a negative impact on the American economy. It will also mean America will have only one ally in the Middle East, Israel. For Israel it will mean an end of the peace game and a return to whole scale war with nation states and not fighting with the Palestinians and other terrorist.

And of course, that includes the Egyptian people. I think that what the President said last night in the State of the Union applies not only to Tunisia, not only to Egypt, but to everyone. And we are particularly hopeful that the Egyptian Government will take this opportunity to implement political, economic, and social reforms that will answer the legitimate interests of the Egyptian people. And we are committed, as we have been, to working toward that goal with Egyptian civil society, with the Egyptian Government, with the people of that great country...With respect to the Egyptian Government, I do think it’s possible for there to be reforms, and that is what we are urging and calling for. And it is something that I think everyone knows must be on the agenda of the government as they not just respond to the protest, but as they look beyond as to what needs to be done economically, socially, politically. And there are a lot of very well informed, active civil society leaders in Egypt who have put forward specific ideas for reform, and we are encouraging and urging the Egyptian Government to be responsive to that.

Begin told the plenum Tuesday that while he is against stripping Zoabi of her rights as an MK, "joining the instigator (Raed Salah) aboard the (Gaza-bound) ship was a small symbolic act that pushed Israeli-Arab relations a few years back." Salah is the leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel. Begin's comments came in response to a no-confidence motion submitted by Arab factions over the government's policy, which they claim "encourages racist legislation." The Likud minister said that over the past few years he has become more attentive to the Arab-Israelis' difficulty to accept Israel's definition as a Jewish state, adding that he has adopted a "more objective" definition of Israel as "the state of the Jewish nation, not the state of Jews in the Diaspora, only the Jews who live here. " Begin said his definition is accepted "by the majority of this House," and added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu considers co-existence a "basic principle of Israeli reality." I am so sorry to hear Begin talk this way,it seems he has lost his way. Let us remember he walked away from the Knesset because of the corruption in it. He came back to try and do some good and now it appears he is just one more of the good old boys. Knesset Member Hanin Zoabi is a traitor for her actions associated with the flotilla.

TA residents protest African migrants at Barak's home By BEN HARTMAN 25/01/2011 Most of the protesters came from the depressed neighborhoods of southern Tel Aviv where the majority of the migrants in the city reside. Shouting “Barak wake up!” and “We want security now!” over a hundred protesters gathered outside Defense Minister Ehud Barak’s house in north Tel Aviv on Tuesday, to protest what they called Barak’s reluctance to take action to stop the influx of African migrants across Israel’s porous southern border with Egypt. Most of the protesters came from the depressed neighborhoods of southern Tel Aviv where the majority of the migrants in the city reside. Many of the protesters related that the influx of migrants has made the social services and quality of life in their neighborhoods decline rapidly, and has brought with it a step rise in crime. RELATED: Eritrean migrant leader to 'Post': We need protection Eilat demands gov’t action against migrant workers Hatikvah resident Ariel Zechariya, 51, said the demonstration was held outside of Barak’s residence because the defense minister “is responsible for the security of Israel and the protection of the border and we believe he isn’t doing his job.” “This is not the responsibility of the police; the defense of our country’s national borders is the responsibility of the army.” Zechariya, a lifelong resident of Hatikvah, long a disadvantaged district of Southern Tel Aviv, described the neighborhood as “a weak area to begin with, and now they’re bringing in more and more people who don’t have anything to eat.” Zechariya said landlords are buying up houses in the neighborhood in order to turn them into high-occupancy residences for African migrants forced to live in inhumane conditions. “The conditions are unbelievable; you or I wouldn’t live in these houses. These [the migrants] are people just like you and I and you see the way they’re living here, without work, without food, it’s a situation that leads to crime.” One of the organizers of the demonstration, 29-year-old Yaniv Israelov, said the protest was held because the government is not doing enough to deal with the growing number of African migrants in Israel. “Every day the concentration [of refugees] grows in south Tel Aviv, threatening our personal security,” Israelov said Tuesday. A life-long resident of South Tel Aviv’s Shapira neighborhood, Israelov said residents are suffering harassment and violence at the hands of “infiltrators”, mentioning the case of an 84-year-old woman who told police she was hit over the head and mugged by a foreign migrant outside her home in the Hatikva neighborhood earlier this month. Israelov said that while the neighborhood is safe during the day, people are afraid to leave their homes at night, when he said, the migrants drink alcohol and cause disturbances. Israelov added that the migrants “aren’t to blame, it’s the government’s fault, they aren’t dealing with the issue. They aren’t checking who these people are, anything, they just take them and throw them in South Tel Aviv.” Israel must act against this and seal our borders. Nothing good can come from letting these people into Israel, it will turn landlords into slum lords in an effort to make more money. Employers will not pay the illegal aliens a proper wage. Lastly these people practice black magic called juju and it will rot our souls if we let it take root.

International pro-Palestinian groups are preparing a massive flotilla of ships to the Gaza Strip in the spring to coincide with the first anniversary of the Israeli operation to stop the Mavi Marmara in late May, organizers said on Monday. The convoy of ships will be named “Freedom Flotilla 2” and is expected to include delegations from close to a dozen different countries as well as ships, for the first time, from the United States and Canada. According to the organizers, the different groups are currently in the process of collecting funds, purchasing vessels and recruiting volunteers. On Sunday, the Turkel Committee submitted its report to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and cleared the government and the Israel Navy of wrongdoing when using lethal force to stop the Mavi Marmara from breaking the Israel-imposed sea blockade on the Gaza Strip last May. Dror Feiler, an Israeli-Swedish musician and artist who lives in Stockholm – and one of the organizers behind the flotilla – said that the flotilla would try to reach Gaza on May 31, the same day that the Israel Navy stopped the Turkish flotilla last year. The coalition behind the new blockade-busting effort includes the Turkish IHH and the Free Gaza Movement, both of which were involved in the May flotilla. It is demanding “an immediate and complete lifting of the closure, including a lifting of the travel ban as well as the ban on exports from Gaza.” According to Feiler, the new flotilla will include activists from Norway, Spain, the US, Canada, Italy, Holland, Indonesia and Malaysia. “The sea is not always predictable but our goal is to get there the same day or at least close to the same day as the last flotilla,” he said. “Our objective is to get Israel to lift the sea blockade over Gaza and we will keep on trying until we succeed.” Huwaida Arraf, one of the heads of the Free Gaza movement which organized the last flotilla with the Turkish IHH organization, said that Freedom Flotilla 2 would be “non-violent” but would make every effort to reach the Gaza Strip. “We are aware that Israel has attacked us in the previous times without justification. Their blockade is illegal and just because they threaten to use force does not mean that we need to stay silent,” Arraf said. “This is a non-violent action. The people of Gaza have the right for freedom and if Israel wants to use force against us and kill people like they did last time then let that be out there for the whole world to see.” Posted by Yoni Tidi at 03:25 PM | Permalink January 23, 2011 Soldier on 'Marmara': 'I thought I was going to die' By YAAKOV KATZ 23/01/2011 Israeli Navy commando testifies to Turkel committee about an attack by a violent mob wielding clubs and bars aboard the flotilla ship's deck. "I thought I was going to die, it was much worse than what we call a danger to your life,” an Israeli Navy commando who was severely beaten and kidnapped by the violent mob aboard the Mavi Maramara Turkish passenger ship last May said in testimony revealed on Sunday. The testimony was revealed by the Turkel Committee’s report submitted to the government on Sunday as well as in a report published by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (ITIC). Identified as Soldier A. in the report, the Navy commando described how he was immediately lynched upon landing on the Mavi Marmara’s upper deck after fast-roping down from an Israeli helicopter. “Before my feet hit the deck about 10 men jumped on me and started beating me with clubs, iron bars, their fists and anything else they could find. They beat my whole body, but they focused especially my head and face. I have to make it clear that at that point I wasn't armed,” the soldier was quoted as saying in the report. “That was when I knew my life was really in immediate danger.” Soldier A. was thrown over the side of the upper deck to the ship’s bottom level and broke his arm upon landing. After landing, he said, another mob started choking him while driving fingers into his eyes in an attempt to gouge them out. “At that point they acted like they were fighting an enemy and had come to kill him, that is, kill me. I kept waiting for the blow to my head that would kill me,” he testified, adding that he was later hospitalized with skull fractures and two cranial hemorrhages. Another command, identified as Soldier B. said that he encountered a frenzied mob with “insane eyes full of hate.” All the people surrounding me were hitting me as hard as they could, especially my head. They were in a frenzy, screaming 'Allahu akbar' ['Allah is great'] over and over. They were hitting me all over,” he said. According to the soldier, after he was taken down to the lower levels of the ship, he was told in English that they planned to kill him. “They dragged me down a ladder, two men, one above and one below… while they were dragging me by my pants they started coming off and my shirt hiked up. I saw that there was massive bleeding and I could see my intestines spilling out of my stomach,” he said.

By Barak Ravid The Turkel Commission investigating the events surrounding the Gaza flotilla of May 2010 is expected to determine that the actions of the commando unit that took control of the ships did not contravene international law, and that the IDF soldiers on the Mavi Marmara acted in self-defense when they killed nine Turkish citizens. The Israeli commission will submit the first part of its findings to Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday, after which they will be made public on Sunday afternoon. The commission's two international observers, Canadian Ken Watkin and Irish David Trimble, concurred with the findings of the commission. Nine Turks were killed when Israeli commandos boarded one of the vessels heading to Gaza in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade. Israel has maintained that the marines opened fire after being attacked by activists wielding knives and clubs. The first part of the Turkel Commission's report will deal with the legality of the naval siege that Israel is enforcing on the Gaza Strip, and its applicability to the rules of international law. The report will also include a summary of the actions that the IDF conducted to enforce the naval siege, and the actions and identities of the organizers and participants of the flotilla. After the first half of the report has been submitted, the commission will continue its work for an additional number of months until it has completed the second half of the report. This second part of the report will deal with creating consistency between the current Israeli system for monitoring and investigating violations of the international conventions of warfare with international standards. The second half of the report will also deal with the process of how decisions regarding the military takeover of the flotilla were arrived at on the political level. Posted by Yoni Tidi at 02:37 PM | Permalink January 19, 2011 PC Rubbish IDF Terminates Military Career of Soldier Involved in Hebron Incident (Subsequent to Official Investigation) GOC Central Command, Maj. Gen. Avi Mizrahi, has officially concluded the investigation of the arrest operation in Hebron on January 7th, during which five active Hamas members were arrested and civilian Amr Qawasme was regrettably killed Maj. Gen.Mizrahi concluded that the initial firing at Qawasme was done following a suspicious movement that caused the soldier to feel that his life was threatened, especially having known about the actions of Wael Bitar, a senior Hamas operative who was the main suspect of the arrest operation. Maj. Gen. Mizrahi concluded that this firing was executed in accordance with IDF rules of engagement. Maj. Gen Mizrahi has also been presented with the results of the inquiry into the matter of a second soldier, who, having watched the first soldier firing at Qawasme, began firing at him as well. Maj. Gen. Mizrahi concluded that while the second soldier did feel threatened, he acted unprofessionaly. Therefore, Maj. Gen. Mizrahi has ordered that the soldier's military term be terminated. The IDF deeply regrets the death of Amr Qawasme. To be Attributed to Security Sources: On the night of January 7th, following to the release of five Hamas militants from the Palestinian prison in Hebron, a special squad from the "Duvdevan" counter-terrorism elite unit was called in for an arrest operation in the city of Hebron. Among the militants, who were part of the Hamas military infrastructure in the Hebron region, was Hamas senior operative Wael Bitar. During the operation, the five aforementioned militants were arrested. Wael Bitar collaborated with the executor of the double suicide bombing in Dimona on February 2008, Shehab Natshe. This terror attack resulted in the death of an Israeli woman and the injury of ten other Israeli civilians. After the targeting of Shehab, Wael Bitar led the planning of additional suicide bombings which were thwarted by the IDF. In September 2008, Bitar was arrested by the Palestinian Authority Security Forces. The "Duvdevan" unit is a professional, elite unit specializing in close combat, camouflage and assimilation into hostile territory in order to capture terror operatives in complex areas and thwarting terror attacks before they are executed. During 2010, the unit executed sixty four such operations, this with no casualties or injury to uninvolved civilians. So Maj. Gen. Mizrahi you found that the second soldier felt his life was threatened but you still are going to throw him out of the IDF. General, you are a PC idiot! The fact that you concur that the second soldier felt his life was threatened, should have been the end of it. Why throw this soldier out of the IDF, but for leftist PC feel good rubbish.. You should be thrown out of the IDF for failing to remember your primary responsibility is your soldiers. You are either trying to win points with the Palestinians or leftist political parties in the Knesset. So what is it you want ? To go into business with one of the leaders of the PA after you retire or do you want to sit on your rear end in the Knesset and get fat off the free food?

At a brief ceremony, the Palestinian's chief envoy to the United States, Maen Areikat, hoisted the red, green, white and black banner outside the PLO General Delegation office. He said he hopes the symbolic act would help win support for independence with or without a peace deal with Israel. "We are proud to see the flag," Areikat said. "It's about time that this flag that symbolizes the struggle of the Palestinian people for self-determination and statehood is raised in the United States. We hope that this will help in the international efforts to provide recognition for the Palestinian state." I say we let neo nazi's open an office in D.C. and let them fly the swastika.

'It is important for us to learn the lesson of North Korea,' he says Roni Sofer Published: 01.17.11, 22:13 / Israel News "It is estimated that Iran will have nuclear capability by the middle of the decade, maybe earlier – by 2014," outgoing Mossad chief Meir Dagan told the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Monday. Last week Dagan was criticized by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying Iran would apparently not manufacture a nuclear bomb by 2015. On Monday he said, "The Iranian nuclear challenge will stay significant. This or that timetable won't change the fact that Iran is striving to achieve military nuclear capability, and in certain scenarios can shorten the time" it takes to have nuclear weapons. "It is important for us to learn the lesson of North Korea, which wasn't taken care of properly and didn't get attention from the international community," Dagan said. The outgoing Mossad chief mentioned other challenges that Israel may face in the future, including the possibility of the establishment of a Palestinian state and its implication on the war against terror. As for Hezbollah, Dagan said the Shiite group remains a significant threat due to its stockpiles of weapons and its ability to attack highly populated areas of Israel, adding that Israel also have to deal with the threats of global jihad. The Israeli intelligence community "will need to deal with these challenges, and in my estimation it will do so successfully," he said. Posted by Yoni Tidi at 08:16 PM | Permalink AMERICA PRESSURES ISRAEL PLENTY Leslie H. Gelb AMERICA PRESSURES ISRAEL PLENTY FOREIGN POLICY JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2011 http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/02/unconventional_wisdom?page=0,6 Scholars, pundits, propagandists, and journalists have created two dangerous pieces of conventional wisdom about the Middle East: that Israelis, not Palestinians, have been the main stumbling block to peace, and that the United States has failed to use its influence to pressure Israel for serious compromises. Both propositions are largely untrue. If uncorrected, these myths could make both Palestinians and Israelis feel irretrievably wronged and unwilling ever to negotiate in good faith. Israel has a long and compelling history of making major concessions to Arabs. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat went to Jerusalem in 1977, and less than two years later, Israel agreed to return the entire Sinai Peninsula, booty of a war it did not start and an act of territorial generosity unprecedented in modern history. Israelis negotiated with Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, whom they rightly considered a terrorist. At the end of U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered the Palestinians several key concessions, including more than 90 percent of the West Bank. After the Annapolis initiative put forward by George W. Bush's administration, one of Barak's successors, Ehud Olmert, upped the offerings considerably: more of the West Bank, a sliver of Arab East Jerusalem for a Palestinian capital, and a land swap to give the new Palestinian state a land link to Gaza. Olmert even privately accepted "the right of return" to Israel for a certain number of Palestinian refugees. To both generous proposals, the Palestinians said either no or nothing. In return, the Israelis received little, and the Palestinians insisted on more of everything. Their rationale was that they needed further concessions to compensate for Israeli demands limiting the size and capability of Palestinian security forces. These restrictions, they said, would undermine the very feasibility of a sovereign Palestinian state. The Israelis argued that they needed these added protections because Israel could not count on Arabs to accept Israel's existence. They cited the Palestinians' rejection of a Jewish history in Israel and even any Jewish connection to the Temple Mount in the heart of Jerusalem. For good measure, the Palestinians still refuse to recognize Israel as a "Jewish state." Nor do the Palestinians acknowledge that when Israel departed Gaza in 2005, it uprooted 9,000 Israeli settlers. In return, Israel got rockets and a terrorist enclave run by Hamas. At each step in this tortuous negotiating process, the United States has pushed and pulled Israel toward concessions, but received little or no credit from the Arab side. Sometimes this pressure has been public, as in President Barack Obama's recent scolding of Israel over its West Bank settlements, but more often it has been private. Yet Arabs have not wanted to credit Washington's role as a peacemaker because they think the United States is capable of exerting even more pressure on Israel. Nonetheless, the American role has been real and substantial. Israel has only made this world of misperceptions worse. It has explained its concessions badly, if at all. Consider, for example, how Israeli governments refuse to tout their history of concessions on the West Bank for fear these would be taken as starting points in ongoing negotiations. Apparently, Israelis would rather look guilty than weak. Israelis certainly deserve criticism for continuing their West Bank settlements. But they deserve credit for their concrete efforts to make peace. And so does the United States. Yet the myths prevail, and dangerously so. Leslie H.

Posted by Yoni Tidi at 11:48 AM | Permalink Egypt warns West to stay out of Arab affairs Published yesterday 16 January 2011 22:18 by Mona Salem http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=351688 CAIRO (AFP) -- Egypt's Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit warned Sunday the West to stay out of Arab affairs, days after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Arab leaders to work with their peoples to bring reforms. And in separate remarks, Cairo's top diplomat downplayed fears that a Tunisian-style popular revolt could spread to other Arab countries, calling it "nonsense." Abul Gheit made the comments in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh where Arab foreign ministers are preparing for an economic summit to be held on Wednesday. Egypt, he said, proposed to Arab League chief Amr Mussa that the summit issue a statement concerning "attempts by some Western and European nations to interfere in Egyptian and Arab affairs." "We hope that the summit will adopt Egypt's proposal which would be a message from the Arab to the Western and European world saying 'Do not dare interfere in our affairs," he was quoted as saying by the official MENA news agency. MENA said he was responding to a question from one of its journalists who asked if the summit could adopt a common position concerning Western bids to interfere in Arab affairs. On Thursday, Clinton urged Arab leaders to work with their peoples to implement reforms or see extremists fill the void, warning the "region's foundations are sinking." The region's peoples "have grown tired of corrupt institutions," Clinton told Arab counterparts in Qatar attending the Forum for the Future, a 2004 US initiative aimed at promoting such partnerships. "In too many places, in too many ways, the region's foundations are sinking into the sand. The new and dynamic Middle East that I have seen needs firmer ground if it is to take root and grow everywhere," she said. Clinton said the region's leaders "in partnership with their peoples" have the capacity to build a bold new future where entrepreneurship and political freedoms are encouraged. "It's time to see civil society not as a threat but as a partner," she said. "Those who cling to the status quo may be able to hold back the full impact of their countries' problems for a little while but not forever. "Others will fill the vacuum," if leaders failed to offer a positive vision to give "young people meaningful ways to contribute," Clinton warned. Abul Gheit also dismissed the notion that people in the Arab world could be inspired by Tunisia, where violent protests forced president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to abandon his post. "The talk about the spread of what happened in Tunisia to other countries is nonsense. Each society has its own circumstances," Abul Gheit told reporters in Sharm el-Sheikh. "If the Tunisian people decide to take that approach, it's their business. "Egypt has said that the Tunisian people's will is what counts," said the foreign minister. "Those who imagine things and seek to escalate the situation will not achieve their goals. "The most important thing is the will of the Tunisian people. Nobody is resisting it," Abul Gheit added. After 23 years of iron-fisted rule, Ben Ali caved in to violent popular protests and fled his country on Friday, becoming the first Arab leader to do so. Governments in the Middle East are increasingly uneasy about the situation as opposition groups seek to take advantage of the upheaval in the north African country. Abul Gheit's remarks also come as Egypt has faced international criticism following legislative polls in November and December amid accusations of fraud, and for its handling of its Coptic Christian minority after a deadly New Year's Day bombing of one of their churches. Posted by Yoni Tidi at 11:47 AM | Permalink January 16, 2011 Honor PA to US: Determined to seek UN anti-settlement resolution By KHALED ABU TOAMEH 16/01/2011 Erekat declares that that PA will ask UN Security Council to declare settlements illegal, despite Washington's opposition; PA will attempt to circumvent US veto power. The Palestinian Authority has turned down a request from the US to refrain from seeking a UN Security Council resolution condemning settlements, Chief PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat declared on Sunday. The PA has announced that it would present to the council a draft resolution that condemns settlements as illegal. The US Administration has been putting pressure on the PA to refrain from going to the Security Council out of fear that such a move would have a negative impact on efforts to revive the stalled peace talks. “The Americans don’t want us to present anything to the Security Council,” Erekat said. “But we made it clear to them that, for us, the Security Council was a gate to international legitimacy.” The PA is determined to seek the resolution from the Security Council in spite of Washington’s opposition, Erekat stressed in a radio interview. The PA envoy to the UN, Riad Mansour, is expected to hold consultations on Monday with other representatives in New York to set a date for presenting the draft resolution to the council, he added. Erekat said that the PA was holding discussions with several countries, including the US, about the proposed draft resolution. “We don’t want this resolution to be met with a US veto by the US or any other party,” he said. “We will continue trying [to seek a UN Security Council resolution] even if there is a veto.” Erekat reiterated the PA’s refusal to make any “undignified” concessions, holding the Israeli government fully responsible for the collapse of the peace talks. “The Israeli government has chosen settlements over peace,” he claimed. “They bear responsibility for the failure of the peace process; this policy will lead to more violence, chaos, extremism and bloodshed.” He said that the US Administration should stop treating Israel as a state that is above the law and back international legitimacy instead of threatening to use the veto at the Security Council. PA negotiator Nasbil Sha’ath reaffirmed the PA’s refusal to resume the peace talks unless Israel halted all settlement construction, including in east Jerusalem. He said that in light of the absence of peace talks and the armed struggle option, the Palestinians were now facing four options: a non-violent popular struggle, seeking international recognition of a Palestinian state, achieving national unity and building state institutions. Sha’ath predicted that within three months all 34 Latin American countries would recognize a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with east Jerusalem as its capital. “We don’t intend to negotiate about the land, but about drawing the border,” he said. “We won’t give up any part of the Palestinian territories, especially Jerusalem.” Honor demands from the USA, only one response. A cutting of all ties to the Palestinians. No funds must be allowed to be transferred to the Palestinians., The USA must also tell them by moving forward with this action they will run head on into a USA veto in the Security Council and American support for Israel to annex Judea and Samaria and that the USA declares Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish state and move the American Embassy to east Jerusalem.

'This isn't Switzerland,' says enraged settler Akiva Novick The Judea and Samaria Division has decided to collect hundreds of weapons handed to West Bank settlers by the army in light of the relative calm in the territories in recent years, infuriating settlement leaders. At the start of the al-Aqsa Intifada, more than a decade ago, the settlers received weapons from the army to help defend their communities. IDF officials have also expressed their fear that settlers may take the law into their own hands and fire at Palestinians approaching the communities' fences. Hebron's Jewish residents will be the first to be affected by the move. The security coordinators in Hebron, South Mount Hebron and Kiryat Arba have been instructed by Colonel Guy Hazut, commander of the Judea Brigade, to collect the military weapons from the settlers and hand them over to the army. 'Reckless decision' The settlers, as expected, are enraged by the new move. "This is a reckless decision which is part of a culture of improvised solutions," a leader of one of the Jewish communities in the area told Yedioth Ahronoth. "Two weeks before the murder of policeman Shuki Sofer (in June 2010), the Judea Brigade commander said that terror attacks in the area were a matter of the past. We mustn't get confused – this isn't Switzerland." The settlement head rejected the IDF's claim that the move was crucial in light of weapon thefts in the area. "There is no calm where terrorists steal weapons. And anyway, much more weapons are stolen in the IDF, even from the vehicles of senior commanders." Right-wing activist Itamar Ben-Gvir, who lives in Hebron, slammed Colonel Hazut. "It looks like he believes settlers are only good for serving in the army, but not for protecting themselves. We are being abandoned." A military source explained that the Judea and Samaria Division planned to collect thousands of weapons from the entire area under its control, and not just from the Hebron area. "We must remember that the past two years have seen a significant calm. Obviously, we'll return the weapons to the residents if needed, but under supervision." The IDF Spokesperson's Office clarified Thursday that the weapons being collected are not in use and that the move is aimed at fighting weapon thefts and in light of evaluations of the security-related situation. This is why I thank G-D America has a thing called a Constitution which gives me the right to own guns. Israel is less free because Jews, Druzes and other who have served can't own guns. So when Jews are attacked their blood will be on Colonel Hazut head, but so what the Jews will still be dead or injured. Posted by Yoni Tidi at 08:03 AM | Permalink January 13, 2011 Lieberman and the Naked Emperor by Prof. Efraim Inbar BESA Center Perspectives Paper No. 125, January 13, 2011 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman takes a blunt approach to politics, one that is often met with resistance at home and abroad. But despite his not-very-diplomatic style, Lieberman's views on issues like the "peace process" and the Israel-Turkey relationship are representative of a large majority of the Israeli public, and his assessments are often right on the mark. We are inundated with critical reports of the strident statements made by Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. He is, reportedly, damaging Israel’s international image. Obviously, political correctness is not one of his main concerns. It has to be acknowledged, however, that Lieberman's not-very-diplomatic style, while uncomfortable, also involves more than a little truth-telling. To a certain extent, Lieberman is playing domestic politics, trying to position himself as leader of the Right. Issues he has raised, such as the oath of allegiance, the conversion bill, and foreign funding of human rights NGOs indeed smack of populism and are simplistic remedies to complex problems. And his bluntness has repeatedly forced Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, a very eloquent representative of the Jewish state, to issue clarifications in order to distance himself from the enfant terrible of Israeli politics. Netanyahu prefers the image of a statesman and a responsible politician. Yet, Lieberman is often telling the naked truth. Let's consider his "provocative" and "irresponsible" statements on the Palestinians and the Turks. The chances of reaching a comprehensive agreement in the near future with the Palestinians, within 12 or 36 months, are indeed nil, as Lieberman has pointed out. The Palestinian Authority is not willing to make any concessions in peace negotiations on Jerusalem or on refugees. It rejects recognition of Israel as a Jewish nation-state. Lieberman is correct also in pointing out that the PA lacks any legitimacy to close a deal with Israel. Abu Mazen’s corrupt regime relies on Israeli bayonets to defend it from Hamas. This is what Lieberman has said, and he is correct in his assessment. Moreover, his views reflect the sober assessment of a large majority of Israelis. Even large swaths of the Israeli Left agree that there is no Palestinian partner for a full peace. So why is it so terrible to tell the truth? Similarly, Lieberman’s evaluation of the behavior of the current Turkish government is right on the mark. Turkey, under Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, has not missed an opportunity to pick a fight with Israel over the past two years, and there is nothing Jerusalem can do but wait for better times. Erdogan-led Turkey is not interested in good relations with Israel, primarily because under his helm Turkey is distancing itself from the West and displaying a greater Islamic coloration in its foreign policy. Anti-Semitic sentiments also fuel the hostility toward Israel. Israelis agree with Lieberman’s refusal to be a "punching bag for Turkey." Thus, it makes no sense to apologize and pay compensation to those who sent IHH terrorists to help Hamas-ruled Gaza. Actually, Lieberman’s assertion that it is Turkey which owes Israel an apology seems more logical. This probably makes sense to most Israelis, who witnessed the brutal treatment of Israeli naval commandos on the Turkish ship at the hands of so-called “peace activists.” Similarly, Lieberman's promotion of a loyalty oath is well in synch with majority Israeli opinion. Israeli Arab leaders have become increasingly vocal and violent in their support for Palestinian irredentism – and Israeli Jews want to see them checked. Most Israelis instinctively feel, as well, that the Ultra-Orthodox-controlled Rabbinate is much too narrow and unwelcoming in its approach to Russian-Israelis who want to convert to Judaism. Another bingo for Lieberman. Lieberman’s attack on left-wing NGOs being fifth columns is also striking a responsive chord among many Israelis that are fed up with Israel’s use of force being portrayed systematically as a human rights violation. After all, the IDF is making consistently great efforts to behave admirably moral. The truth is often unpleasant. As a result, the seemingly noble and relentless search for an unavailable peace formula is preferred by many to acceptance of the bad news that there is no chance to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict soon. Incredibly generous Israeli concessions by Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert did not bring about peace because of the Palestinians' insatiable appetite. Nevertheless, entrenched formulas and paradigms are difficult to discard. The inertia of the “peace process” and the sunken costs are not conducive to taking a fresh look at a 17-year-long failure to bridge the differences between Israelis and Palestinians. Similarly, the realization that diplomatic maneuvers or clever formulas cannot fix relations with a Turkey that has chosen to side with radical Islam goes against unfounded optimism. The possibility that ignoring reality is more dangerous than pursuing unrealistic policies does not always register. Lieberman is not off the mark in pointing out that the flow of foreign money to Israeli NGOs is a serious issue that needs to be squarely dealt with. This is necessary particularly because some of these NGOs are blatantly biased with a clear Israel-demonization agenda hidden behind a human rights discourse. This Israeli government understands the depressing reality, though a cool assessment will probably dictate going along with falsehoods to please the world. After all, telling the truth might push Israel into greater isolation. Lying is what the world expects of Jerusalem, and in the short run at least, such lying probably best serves Israel’s interests. In the longer run, however, political correctness may prove extremely costly. Lieberman is having none of this. He is enjoying the role of the boy who exposed the sham behind the Emperor’s new clothes. But in contrast to the naïve boy in that well-known fable, Lieberman is a shrewd politician. The emphasis on naked truth suits his search for votes. After all, truth has certain appeal among Israeli voters. This is Israel’s dilemma.

Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store censured Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman Wednesday for his sharp criticism of NGOs, telling The Jerusalem Post it was "dangerous" to link these organizations to terrorism. In the harshest comments to date from a leading European statesmen regarding the establishment of a parliamentary committee to investigate funding of the NGOs, Store said, "When leading politicians go out and compare and link NGOs to terror, I think it is very dangerous. These messages have enormous impact and create suspicion, mutual suspicion, and a climate that democracy should not have. I think it is a worrying sign." Lieberman on Sunday charged leftist NGOs with "aiding terror groups." Store, on a two day visit, told the Post he was "very concerned" about the recent Knesset action on the NGOs. "Israel is the democracy in this region," he said. "A vibrant civil society, with organizations that say things which we don't like as governments, is part of democracy, it is a test of a strong democracy." Norway is significant donor to some 18 NGOs operating in Israel and the PA – such as the Palestinian Central Bureau for Statistics, the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizen's Rights, and the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee -- and the issue came up during a meeting Lieberman and Store held in Jerusalem Tuesday evening. But what if NGO's are in fact supporting terrorist? Where does democracy end and suicide begin? I know from hands on with these leftist groups that they aid and abed terrorism. It is past time for Israel to go after these groups that are wolves in sheep clothing.

The action follows "new statements from the Vatican concerning Egypt which are considered by Egypt as unacceptable interference in its internal affairs," the ministry spokesman said in an apparent reference to remarks concerning Copts. The pontiff has expressed repeatedly his solidarity with the Copts and called on world leaders to protect them in the aftermath of a New Year's Day church bombing that killed 21 people as worshippers emerged from midnight mass in Alexandria. A day after the attack on the Al-Qiddissin (The Saints) church, the pope appealed for the "concrete and constant engagement of leaders of nations," in what he termed a "difficult mission." At his New Year's Day mass, Benedict underscored that "humanity cannot display resignation in the face of negative forces of selfishness and violence, it cannot get accustomed to conflicts which claim victims and endanger the future of people." On Sunday Benedict again voiced solidarity with Egypt's Copts -- two days after they marked their Christmas, celebrated on January 7. "I salute the Coptic faithful present here to whom I renew my expression of closeness," the pope told thousands of people gathered in Saint Peter's Square. Benedict has already come under harsh criticism for speaking out for the Copts. 'Misunderstandings in communication' Egypt's top Muslim cleric, Ahmed al-Tayeb, criticized the pope's call on world leaders to defend the Copts as interference in his country's affairs. "I disagree with the pope's view, and I ask why did the pope not call for the protection of Muslims when they were subjected to killings in Iraq?" the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, the oldest Islamic seat of learning and Sunni Muslim authority, told a news conference on January 2. The Vatican immediately rejected the accusation, saying the head of the Roman Catholic Church had shown solidarity with the Coptic community as well as concern for the consequences of the violence for the Christian and Muslim population. "Therefore we cannot see how the pope's approach to bring everybody to accept non-violence can be considered meddling," Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said. "I think there are misunderstandings in communication but I don't think we should play up the imam's statement." Lombardi said the Vatican referred to "an attack against a Christian church and therefore we are concerned about Christian minorities but that does not mean that we will justify or minimize violence against the faithful of other religion."

The Kadima faction on Monday stated that it will oppose the proposal to establish a parliamentary commission of inquiry to investigate the funding and activities of left-wing organizations. Kadima Chairwoman Tzipi Livni said in an official statement: "An evil wave has been sweeping over the country. The Netanyahu-Lieberman government fans the flames of fire, either alone or in partnership with some Knesset members. I object to the activity of these [left-wing] organizations, and will criticize them while acting against foreign interference, but we have a duty to stand up against this wave. Stopping this evil wave is not only the duty of the left but of all those who are committed to Israel and its values." Livni you are a traitor and an idiot. The evil in Israel is those individuals, organizations that work against the IDF and police to provide security for the Jewish people. If you work with the Palestinians to weaken Israel then that is the evil that must be fought against by all means possible including using deadly force to remove the threat from Israel. Posted by Yoni Tidi at 09:06 AM | Permalink Proposed bill could allow expulsion of left-wing activists By REBECCA ANNA STOIL 09/01/2011 MK Yariv Levin recruiting additional co-sponsors for initiative that would forbid foreigners defined as enemy agents from entering Israel. Less than a week after the Knesset voted to establish a parliamentary inquiry committee to examine left-wing organizations’ foreign funding, MK Yariv Levin (Likud) prepared on Sunday to introduce a bill that would allow the Interior Ministry to deport or prevent the entry of foreign activists who harm Israel’s security or image. Levin is preparing the measure together with attorney Hila Cohen of the Legal Forum for the Land of Israel. Although it is not clear when it will be officially filed with the Knesset secretary, the bill is fully drafted, and Levin is recruiting additional co-sponsors for the initiative. It is not clear how much support the initiative will garner, but after the recent vote on MK Fania Kirschenbaum’s (Israel Beiteinu) inquiry-committee measure, the bill may enjoy strong momentum in its advance through the Knesset. The bill would authorize the interior minister “to forbid entrance to Israel or to expel from Israel people defined as enemy agents who harm Israel’s security or image,” the Legal Forum for the Land of Israel said. It details specific types of activities defined as harming Israel’s security, including denying the existence of the Holocaust, boycotting Israel or Israeli products, and working to hold international court proceedings against Israeli citizens because of activities carried out while serving in Israel’s security organizations. In the bill’s current form, the interior minister would be authorized to forbid violators from spending time in Israel. “In each and every generation, there are those who rise up against us to destroy us, and as the State of Israel, the state of the Jewish people, we must act and do everything that we can do to prevent and isolate these phenomena in Israel and in the world,” the bill’s introduction reads. “Today, there is no legal basis whatsoever that allows the state to act and to express its desire to not give legitimacy to those who act to negate – through initiatives, organization, funding or practical acts – the justification for the existence of the State of Israel, and also Israel’s actions taken for the defense, the security and the welfare of its citizens,” the measure’s drafters explain. The legislation “is designed to deal with all kinds of agents who are not citizens, immigrants or qualified to be immigrants” who engage in activities including “fund-raising, organizing protests, and incitement,” Cohen told The Jerusalem Post. The interior minister would be allowed to deport foreign activists already in Israel, or deny entry to those trying to enter Israel, for either a limited period or permanently. The bill is a proposed amendment to the law detailing the parameters for legal presence in Israel. Organizations could also be placed on the list of non-welcome entities, meaning that the organizations’ leaders would all be barred from entry. The legislation also delineates an appeals process by which parties who feel that they have been unfairly blocked from entry could appeal the interior minister’s decision. “This bill is critical because such activities have become very common,” Cohen said. “At least Israel, if it cannot prevent them from doing what they do overseas, can at least make this statement that Israel will not let people do it within its borders. Israel must say that we are not willing for people to take these actions.” The Association for Civil Rights in Israel criticized the proposal on Sunday evening. “From online reports concerning Levin’s planned bill it seems this is another legislative attempt by the current Knesset to silence critical voices, and falsely label all criticism as illegitimate positions that undermine the very existence of the state,” ACRI spokeswoman Ronit Sela said. “Those familiar with the work of the Interior Ministry know that its unofficial policy to date is to discourage visitors who hold critical views of Israel’s policies from attempting to enter the country. Were this harmful procedure to become a law, it would serve as a clear warning sign of the declining state of our democracy by the hands of members of Knesset who disregard democracy’s basic values and human rights.” I support this bill groups from the outside such as ISM should be banned from Israel, I will even say it's leadership should be targeted with lethal force. They support the enemies of the Jewish people and Israel and they must pay the price for this. Posted by Yoni Tidi at 09:02 AM | Permalink January 09, 2011 Cabinet Approves Plan to Promote Military and Civic Service in the Ultra-Orthodox Sector (Communicated by the Prime Minister's Media Adviser) The Cabinet today (Sunday), 9.1.11, approved a plan to promote military and civic service in the ultra-orthodox sector so as to double the number of ultra-orthodox young men who enlist in the IDF, national security service and national civic service. According to the plan, the number of draftees will reach 4,800 by 2015 (2,400 for military service and 2,400 for civic service). It was also agreed that the IDF would create additional combat frameworks in order to absorb the ultra-orthodox. In order to meet this goal, the Government will allocate an additional NIS 130 million in order to create new and unique frameworks for draftees from the ultra-orthodox sector, and NIS 70 million per annum for developing new civic service frameworks. The decision also determines that the age at which ultra-orthodox young men without children may be enrolled in regular civic service, as an alternative to military service, will be 26. Prime Minister Netanyahu also decided to significantly increase and strengthen the "Shahar" project for the ultra-orthodox population, in which ultra-orthodox young men serve in IDF technological frameworks for a period of approximately two years and are trained to enter the civilian labor market. The Prime Minister, along with the Finance; Industry, Trade and Labor; Defense; and Science and Technology ministries, also decided to formulate a program to assist ultra-orthodox young men serving in the IDF and in civic service, in integrating into the labor market after their service. During the discussion, worrying data were presented which indicated that without a change, within 20 years, the proportion of ultra-orthodox in the potential labor force would rise from 6% to 17%, even as approximately 60% of ultra-orthodox Israelis are currently defined as poor. There is a prominent correlation between military and national service and integration in the labor market; 80% of veterans of the ultra-orthodox unit in the IDF Nahal Brigade are integrated into the labor force. Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that this was an unprecedented and important decision that will increase the number of ultra-orthodox young men in the military and in civic service, encourage their integration into the labor force and help create a more just sharing of the burden in society: "We will not allow a growing proportion of the ultra-orthodox public to be exempt from service ostensibly due to 'full-time religious studies.' The State of Israel cannot endure this; therefore, today, I have submitted this change, which will start an opposite process, just as I did when the rate of public expenditure was too high and was liable to wreck the economy."

The demolition of the Shepherd Hotel, located in east Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, started at dawn on Sunday after a drawn-out battle over construction rights that drew international condemnation from US President Barack Obama and other leaders around the world over the past few years. The hotel, which was built in the 1930s by the former mufti of Jerusalem Hajj Amin Al Huseini, was bought in 1985 by right-wing millionaire Irving Moskovitz, who has bankrolled other controversial Jewish housing projects in Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem. Moskovitz, partnering with the Ateret Cohanim organization, plans to turn the complex into 20 apartments for religious Jewish families.

Four soldiers were injured by gunfire along the border fence of the central Gaza Strip Friday evening. According to preliminary reports, a cell of terrorists was situated along the fence near Kibbutz Nirim and opened fire on IDF soldiers from the Paratroopers Brigade with automatic weapons and mortars. RELATED: IDF arrests Hamas men in Hebron, strikes Gaza IAF strikes Gaza Strip in response to Kassam fire Palestinian sources reported that the firefight lasted 20 minutes and that tank shells were fired, according to AFP. There was no word of Palestinian casualties. The cell apparently waited in ambush for an IDF patrol and opened fire when the patrol passed by. An officer in the Southern Command told Channel 10: "We are still learning the details of the event. The soldiers were transferred to the trauma center at Soroka Hospital [in Beersheba] where their condition will be determined." The officer continued, "From initial details, it seems that we are dealing with a planned ambush by a terrorist cell that intended to observe IDF forces operating in the area where the incident occurred." He added that additional forces were quickly called to the location. Palestinian news agency Ma'an reported that IAF helicopters fired missiles into the Strip in response to the incident, which the IDF spokesperson declined to confirm or deny. Responding to reports of suspicions that some of the soldiers were injured by friendly fire from another unit operating in the area, the IDF spokesperson said that the possibility is being investigated along with several other scenarios. The spokesman noted that an investigation has not yet been carried out. Earlier Friday, a protest took place in the Gaza Strip over the death of 66-year-old Omar Kawasmeh, who was mistakenly killed during an IDF arrest raid in the West Bank city of Hebron Thursday night. During the Gaza rally, Hamas official Ismail Radwan made a call "to unleash the resistance to respond to [the death]," Ma'an reported. Also on Friday, the PFLP claimed responsibility for firing a mortar shell into Israeli territory. The shell landed in an open area in the Eshkol Regional Council. No injuries were reported. So go ahead and unlease the resistance. If Bbi unleashes the power of the IDF how long do you think you will last? I hope you do unleash, so we can unleash. Let's go for it, I am not afraid of you nor should Am Israel be afraid of you.

According to a report posted on IranNuc.ir website on Wednesday, the Israeli spy agency has a long record in assassinating Arab and Muslim scientists in collaboration with its US and British counterparts (CIA and MI6). The report revealed the names of several Arab scientists who were assassinated by Mossad, including Yahiya Amin al-Mashd and Samireh Mousa (Egyptian scientists), Samir Najib, Nabil al-Qolaini, Nabil Ahmad Folayfel, Mostafa Ali Moshrefah (known as the Arab World's Einstein), Jamal Hamdan, Saeed Sayyed Badir, Salvi Habib, Ramal Hassan Ramal (Lebanese physicist), Hassan Kamel Sabbah (Lebanese physicist known as the Arab World's Edison). Global attention was redirected to Mossad's terror plots for assassinating the nuclear scientists of the Islamic world after Iranian professor Majid Shahriari was killed by the Israeli spy agency in Tehran late in 2010. Two Iranian university professors Fereidoon Abbasi Davani and Majid Shahriari were assassinated in separate terrorist bomb attacks here in Tehran on November 29 with the latter killed immediately after the blast. Recent media reports said that Mossad leaders have recently convened in a meeting in a neighborhood North of Tel Aviv and discussed the agency's latest operations in Tehran, including the assassination of Shahriari. Another Iranian university professor and nuclear scientist, Massoud Ali Mohammadi, was also assassinated in a terrorist bomb attack in Tehran in January 2010. Also later in December, Iraq's young nuclear scientist, Mohammad al-Fouz, was gunned down in the country's capital city of Baghdad by Mossad. He had released his new uranium enrichment formula in a number of western journals. Earlier reports had shown Mossad's involvement in the assassination of more than 350 Iraqi nuclear scientists as well as more than 300 university professors, and the attack on Mohammad al-Fouz was the most recent case in a chain of attacks carried out in recent years. Posted by Yoni Tidi at 05:46 PM | Permalink January 05, 2011 Beilin: Pardon Katsav Former justice minister tells Army Radio 'real punishment' for ex-president 'is not to be separated from society but rather to remain on his street.' Gal-On: A rapist's place is in prison Associated Press A former Israeli justice minister on Wednesday said ex-President Moshe Katsav should be pardoned to spare Israelis the sight of a former head of state serving jail time for rape. Katsav's conviction last week has riveted the nation, with nearly unanimous scorn for the disgraced politician and wall-to-wall praise for the legal system that proved itself egalitarian by bringing him to justice. But some voices are starting to emerge questioning the sweeping verdict - saying the judges essentially dismissed Katsav's denials and chose to believe the complainant's version - and asking what kind of punishment is appropriate for the country's former head of state. Yossi Beilin, a former justice minister who once led the dovish Meretz Party, said Katsav's public humiliation was enough of a punishment and would serve as a powerful deterrent to other officials. He said it was not in the public interest to see a former symbol of the state behind bars. "He obviously deserves a heavy punishment, but the question is whether we also deserve that punishment when the country is being portrayed all over the world as a country whose president is like this," Beilin told Israel's Army Radio. "I think the real punishment for Moshe Katsav is not to be separated from society but rather to remain on his street, to look into the eyes of those close to him, to look into the eyes of his grandchildren and to know that everyone knows the truth." The proposal was quickly lambasted by women's rights advocates. "A rapist's place is in prison," said former lawmaker Zahava Gal-On. 'Court not willing to intervene' A pardon would have to come from Katsav's successor as president, Shimon Peres, whose office has refused to discuss the scenario. Last week, a Tel Aviv court ruled that Katsav twice raped a woman who worked for him when he served as tourism minister in the 1990s, and assaulted and harassed two other woman who worked for him when he was president, from 2000 to 2007. The scathing ruling called him "manipulative" and said his testimony was riddled with lies. He faces between four to 16 years in prison for the offenses. Katsav attorney Zion Amir said he would announce whether he intends to appeal the verdict after sentencing, which is expected to be delivered within the next two months. Amir said Katsav and his team would not be making any other comments until sentencing takes place. Experts seem to agree that a successful appeal is highly unlikely. Israel's Supreme Court traditionally only overturns convictions based on the interpretation of the law. It usually does not challenge the factual findings of lower courts that heard testimonies and questioned witnesses. Emanuel Gross, a criminal law professor at Haifa University, said the court "is not willing to intervene in any way whenever it gets to fact finding." The ruling, reached after 18 months of closed door hearings, has been perceived locally as a victory for the Israeli legal system and women's rights. But it was also striking in its extremely categorical language, despite the lack of physical evidence and the apparent reliance on testimony, from the victims and from other witnesses who testified to similar behavior. Katsav's legal troubles began late in his presidency when he complained in 2006 that a female employee was trying to blackmail him. The woman went to police with her side of the story, detailing a series of alleged sexual assaults. Other women then came forward with other complaints. He resigned a year later, two weeks before his seven-year term expired. Katsav has alleged he was a victim of a political witch hunt, and his legal team says the public climate against him influenced the judges' ruling. Prosecutors initially agreed to a plea bargain that would have required him to admit to lesser charges of sexual misconduct and kept him out of jail. But Katsav rejected the plea bargain at the last minute in 2008 and vowed to clear his name in court. At the time, prosecutors said they offered the plea because the evidence may not suffice for a conviction. Law professor Uriel Procaccia said that raises questions over how the final verdict was so definitive. In light of the uncertainty, Procaccia wrote, "I find it hard to join the chorus celebrating (Katsav's) disgrace and cheering his conviction." So the message is if you are President of Israel you can rape women? Katsav should sit a long time in prison for this, which is only because we don't have the death penalty for rape.

In a conference at the Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba regarding the Moroccan Jewry, Ben-Simon said: "Who is Michael Ben Ari? A Mizrahi by mother and father, a devout Kahanist. Had he lived in Germany he would have been lining up to join the Nazi party." He then added, "This is not our Sephardic heritage." MK Ben Ari is known as a right-wing activist who is one of the leaders of the campaign to deport foreigners from Israel and separating Jewish girls from Arab men. He also endorsed the rabbis' letter calling Jews not to rent and sell apartments to Arabs. Ben-Simon also criticized the Mizrahi Jews in Israel. "I'm telling you, the nationalistic religious radicalism is coming from the Mizrahi sectors. American academics ask me – why is it that the Moroccans are the most extreme? I go to Morocco for a conference and there is the deputy Moroccan foreign minister asking me 'Where is this extremism coming from?' and I have to defend myself all the time as though we have a gene of radicalism." MK Michael Ben Ari said in response: "Nazis are those who wanted to annihilate the Jewish people. It's a pity Ben-Simon finds himself, and not for the first time, teaming up with those who hurt the State of Israel. Ben-Simon with his actions will destroy us and joins our worst enemies. In these circumstances he is better off being quiet and not trying to get media attention off of my back."

Israel has an “arsenal of possible responses” it can deploy in response to a unilateral Palestinian declaration of statehood, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday. Netanyahu, who did not spell out what steps Israel would take, said he preferred “not going” down that unilateral path “because it is a negative direction.” The prime minister said he had spoken recently with Chilean President Sebastián Piñera in an effort to prevent Santiago from recognizing a Palestinian state – something a number of Latin American countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador, have done in recent weeks. Uruguay announced that it would recognize Palestinian statehood in 2011. According to the prime minister, such recognition distances negotiations and makes peace more unlikely, because it strengthens the Palestinians’ sense that they can get what they want without negotiations. Netanyahu bewailed what he said had become the Palestinian “three no’s”: No to recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, no to dropping their demand for a Palestinian refugee “right of return,” and no to agreed-upon security arrangements on the ground. The prime minister was making a reference to the Arab League’s Khartoum Resolution of September 1, 1967, and its “Three No’s”: “no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it.” Netanyahu, who informed the MKs that White House senior adviser Dennis Ross was due back later this week, said the Palestinians had shown no willingness to compromise on either substantive or procedural issues. They have shown “no movement,” he said. He reiterated what he said last week during a Channel 10 interview, that coalition considerations would not prevent him from pursing a peace agreement if he thought one was possible. “No coalition agreement will prevent reaching an agreement with the Palestinians,” promised Netanyahu. “On the first day of this government, I asked [Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud] Abbas to hold direct negotiations and received no response.” He added that “Israel is continuing to advance the peace process, but the Palestinians have not moved one millimeter. “We crossed our Rubicon; the question is, will the Palestinians?” he went on. “Are they ready to stand before their public and advance peace? They went into talks around the end of the building moratorium, but the only topic that they discussed was the continuation of the freeze.” Following the end of the building freeze in September, the Americans suggested an additional three-month freeze, , Netanyahu said. “We had talks with the Americans about what we wanted in return. The truth is that we were ready to do it again, contrary to reports that Israel refused to extend it. Ultimately it was the Americans who backed down from the talks - and rightly so, I think, because in the past all the conversations with the Palestinians were about continuing the freeze and not about the key subjects,” he said. Answering a question from MK Tzipi Hotovely (Likud) regarding progress on the planned Palestinian city of Rawabi, outside of Ramallah, the prime minister said, “I think that it is a positive step. The Palestinians are building constantly, but this time it is a visible project that all the world can observe. It is a city that will be part of the future Palestinian state, and we are looking into easing restrictions on transit surrounding the city.” Asked about the Syrian track, Netanyahu said Israel was open to talks with Damascus as long as there were no “preconditions.” The problem with the Syrians, he said, was that they demanded Israel give up everything before they would even enter talks. “We are ready and willing to hold negotiations with Syria,” the prime minister declared during the meeting. “The problem is that Syria wants us to give the whole territory [the Golan Heights] as a precondition for talks.” Netanyahu said there was no lack of countries that had volunteered their services as intermediaries with the Syrians, including the Americans, Germans, French and Bulgarians. The prime minister made clear in the meeting that Israel had no intention of apologizing to Turkey for the Mavi Marmara incident, although it was willing to express regret over the loss of life. He emphasized that he “saw an opportunity with Turkey during the [Carmel] fire,” and that contacts were continuing with Ankara. “We are not interested in a continuation of the deterioration of the relationship,” he said – adding, however, that Israel would not accept a formula for putting the ties back on track that would imply that IDF soldiers were guilty of wrongdoing. Opposition leader Tzipi Livni attacked Netanyahu after he said that since 1995, he had supported a two-state solution. The prime minister said that he had spoken during a Likud central committee meeting in support of establishing a “state-minus” in a demilitarized area of the West Bank. “It is amazing how you describe an alternate reality, and claim that it is the truth,” charged the Kadima chairwoman. “It is strange that you fall back upon 1995 when in 2002, you announced in the Likud central committee, ‘Yes to a Jewish state means no to a Palestinian state, and we must say no.’” Livni went on to accuse Netanyahu of causing damage to the nation’s security interests.

Chile and Uruguay will soon join the ranks of South American countries recognizing a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, Israel Radio quoted a Palestinian Authority official as saying. Senior PA official Riyad al-Maliki said that Chile will recognize the Palestinian state in the coming weeks. He added that Chilean President Sebastián Piñera plans to visit the West Bank within the next three months. Maliki said that Paraguay was also expected to recognize the Palestinian state, with Uruguay following in March. According to Maliki, a Palestinian embassy will be opened in Ecuador, who has already announced its recognition of a Palestinian state. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday laid the first stone of what is set to become a Palestinian embassy in Brazil. At the beginning of December, Brazil and Argentina recognized the state of Palestine based on borders at the time of Israel's 1967 conquest of the West Bank. The Foreign Ministry came out against Argentina and Brazil's decision to recognize a Palestinian state. “Recognition of a Palestinian state is a violation of the interim agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 1995, which established that the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be discussed and solved through negotiations. “All attempts to bypass negotiations and to unilaterally determine issues in dispute will only harm the trust of the sides and their commitment to agreed upon frameworks for negotiations,” the statement read.
