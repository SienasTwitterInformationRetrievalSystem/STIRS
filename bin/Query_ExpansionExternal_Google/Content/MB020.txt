But several experts say the additives are quite common in processed foods. February 01, 2011 | By Gregory Karp and Ellen Gabler Taco Bell fans have spent the last week wondering what's really in their meals after a lawsuit was filed alleging that the popular fast-food chain's meat contains a whole lot of mystery. Some consumers cringed at the term "taco meat filling," which is how the lawsuit says Taco Bell should advertise its seasoned beef. It alleges that the product contains mostly substances other than beef. Taco Bell Corp., a Yum Brands Inc. subsidiary based in Irvine, has fired back, refuting the lawsuit's allegations and defending its menu ingredients. As it turns out, the lawsuit's allegations — and the stomach-churning terminology — hinge partly on regulatory language that is meant to be used by manufacturers for labeling purposes, not restaurants. There also aren't any hard rules that define what a company or restaurant can advertise as meat. "Obviously you know it's not 100% organic food," said Taco Bell customer Bethany Weis, 23, of Chicago. "I know it's not good for me. I still like it." In striking back against the suit, Taco Bell states that its beef recipe is 88% beef and 12% seasonings, spices, water and other ingredients. Some of those "other ingredients" aren't things you are likely to add to your own beef for family taco night, but several experts say the additives are quite common in processed foods. Alabama attorney W. Daniel "Dee" Miles III started the beef brouhaha after filing a false-advertising suit that contends Taco Bell mislabels its products by telling consumers they are eating "beef" or "seasoned ground beef" despite having the product labeled internally as "taco meat filling." That jargony term comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has a 202-page labeling and policy book that is designed to help manufacturers prepare product labels that are truthful and not misleading. According to the USDA, which regulates the nation's meat supply, "taco meat filling" is required to contain at least 40% fresh meat and must be labeled with the product name, including the word "filling." But that requirement applies to raw meat sold by manufacturers. The USDA doesn't regulate what companies such as restaurants can describe to their customers in advertisements as "beef," "chicken" or "meat," USDA press officer Neil Gaffney said. The Federal Trade Commission is the agency that regulates whether advertising is deceptive. The FTC has no specific rules that define what can be advertised as meat or beef, said Betsy Lordan, an FTC spokeswoman. In the lawsuit, Miles includes what appears to be a label from Taco Bell's raw meat mixture, which reads "taco meat filling." Miles said in an interview that he had the company's meaty mix tested and found that, overall, 15% was protein. Miles wouldn't turn over his laboratory reports to Tribune Newspapers, and after the story became a nationwide phenomenon, he stopped answering questions about it. But that low percentage might not be as surprising as it sounds. Ground beef alone is more than half composed of naturally occurring water, according to the USDA. And it's common for food manufacturers to add seasonings and other ingredients to food, said Susan Brewer, a professor in the department of food science and human nutrition at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It's completely expected that meat would contain about 12% protein, with most of the rest being water and fat, Brewer said. "Protein is not the major component," she said. And if you've ever had a Taco Bell taco, or any taco for that matter, you know the brown, spicy meat mixture contains more than just beef. In its public-relations rebuttal to the lawsuit, Taco Bell said its seasoned beef includes "ingredients you'd find in your home or in the supermarket aisle." It goes on to name ingredients that sound reasonable: salt, chili pepper, onion powder, tomato powder, sugar, garlic powder, even cocoa powder. But there are also some seasoned beef ingredients Taco Bell left out of its national ad campaign last week to refute allegations in the lawsuit — ingredients you might have a tough time finding in your home pantry or grocery store. Soy lecithin, for example. It's a byproduct of soybean processing that is used as an emulsifier. That means it helps blend and bind substances that would otherwise separate, like oil and water. And then there's autolyzed yeast extract. Made by breaking down yeast cells with salt, it's a flavor-enhancing additive similar to monosodium glutamate, without the side effects of MSG some people experience. It gives foods a full, savory, beeflike taste, Brewer said. Maltodextrin is derived from starches, usually corn in the U.S. It can be used as a sweetener and a thickener. 1 | 2 | Next FEATURED Death of Scott Sterling, son of Clippers owner, ruled accidental The frequent fliers who flew too much How not to say the wrong thing MORE: Mayor feels a `sense of failure' in marital split Seizure Led to FloJo's Death His 104 scores make his case Brutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons' Shock Advertisement &lt;a href=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=339767&amp;cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=339767&amp;cs=511bf90462582&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; FROM THE ARCHIVES Rick Perry joins colleagues to voice support for 'pink...

Brooks, RN, BSN (Sigma Theta Tau) What’s more? Taco Bell now boasts of putting all of these chemical-based ingredients into your food to sell it. A California woman filed a lawsuit claiming that Taco Bell’s beef products contain very little meat. The class-action suit objects to Taco Bell calling its products “seasoned ground beef or seasoned beef, when in fact a substantial amount of the filling contains substances other than beef.” According to attorney W. Daniel Miles III, just 35% of the Taco Bell taco filling was a solid, and just 15% overall was protein. Taco Bell officials rejected the claims that the meat in their tacos, burritos and other products is not all beef. Taco Bell President Greg Creed said, “At Taco Bell, we buy our beef from the same trusted brands you find in the supermarket. We start with 100% USDA-inspected beef. Then we simmer it in our proprietary blend of seasonings and spices to give our seasoned beef its signature Taco Bell taste and texture.” Okay. If that means Taco Bell uses the same USDA meat found in markets, then Taco Bell uses the same steroid-pumped, factory farmed beef, caged in at least ankle-deep urine-soaked manure that requires the insertion of ammonia to stop the E. coli bacteria that most, if not all, of the other fast food chains use. Its largest supplier, Tyson Foods Inc., is well-known for putting 14% salt brine and MSG into chickens. If they put salt and MSG into their chickens before shipping, then what do they put into their beef to make it taste better? We suspect that the use of the bland-tasting GMO Bt corn-fed beef is the reason why Taco Bell must put so many additives and chemicals into their tacos and burritos. The lawsuit alleges and Taco Bell admits on their website that the alleged meat mixture contains binders and fillers. Taco Bell took out ads proclaiming that its taco filling is 88% beef. Assuming for a moment that Taco Bell’s representation is true, that means there is still 12% of GMO foods and additive ingredients such as MSG in the taco. If there is four ounces of beef in the taco, then it contains one-half ounce (4 and a half full teaspoons) of artificial chemicals. Even by their standards, that’s a lot of junk in a taco. The lawsuit points out that Taco Bell saves money by adding fillers because the beef is the most expensive part of their products. But we suspect that the chemicals are added because GMO Bt Toxin-fed beef is tasteless and dull unless “spiked” with chemicals such as MSG and BT Toxin-derived high fructose corn syrup are added. How many food additives, ingredients that hide MSG and variations of GMO Bt corn are added? Judge for yourself. These are the ingredients in a common order of a taco, tortilla and enchilada rice taken directly from Taco Bell’s website so we would not be accused of exaggerating. Several research groups including Consumer Reports have independently tested such products and found that they contain 2.5 times more than what is set forth on the ingredients label. In some, instances, particularly sugar, the amounts double because the sugar in high fructose corn syrup is not added to the amount of sugar on the label. Seasoned Ground Beef Beef, Water, Seasoning [Isolated Oat Product, Salt, Chili Pepper, Onion Powder, Tomato Powder, Oats (Wheat), Soy Lecithin, Sugar, Spices, Maltodextrin, Soybean Oil (Anti-dusting Agent), Garlic Powder, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Citric Acid, Caramel Color, Cocoa Powder (Processed With Alkali), Silicon Dioxide, Natural Flavors, Yeast, Modified Corn Starch, Natural Smoke Flavor], Salt, Sodium Phosphates. CONTAINS SOYBEAN, WHEAT – Approximately 25 ingredients. If only 30% of the supposed meat is beef, then you are essentially eating a soy-wheat substitute with a little beef to keep from completely false advertising its content. At least 19 ingredients contain MSG hidden using industry-wide “clean labeling” tricks. Approximately 12 ingredients come from genetically modified fruits, vegetables and spices. An unholy cocktail of chemical ingredients worthy of Swamp Thing.

CONTAINS: WHEAT *Will Contain One Of The Ingredient Statements Above, Depending Upon Regional Suppliers. This is another 40 plus ingredients with more than 20 of which contain a form of MSG and approximately 12 ingredients are derived from genetically modified plants. A Chalupa Shell contains approximately 70 Ingredients. Chipotle Sauce contains approximately 29 Ingredients. Their Chili contains approximately 45 Ingredients. Their Enchilada Rice contains approximately 50 ingredients. The Fiesta Salsa contains 12 ingredients and the Fire Roasted Salsa contains 23 ingredients. Please remember that we copied these ingredients directly from the Taco Bell website. A simple taco in a shell with ground beef, rice and salsa contains approximately 128 ingredients most of which contain MSG and are derived from genetically modified fruits vegetables and spices. So, how many more teaspoons of ingredients does a Super Taco contain? It only takes about four ingredients to make a taco shell at home. It only takes about five ingredients to make seasoned ground beef at home – including spices. Fifty ingredients to make Enchilada Rice? Shocking! Rice is one of the simplest meals to cook and making in the traditional Mexican-style only takes a few spices and some peppers. For those of us growing up in Southern California, Taco Bell is not Mexican food. We really don’t know what it is or what to call it other than manipulated junk food. After having real Mexican food prepared in “mom and pop” stores or even taco and burrito stands around Los Angeles, Taco Bell should be embarrassed. If you think your hamburger is any better, we suggest that you read our blog, Does Your Fast Food Hamburger Come from Steroid-pumped, Caged Cattle, Knee-deep in Urine Soaked Manure? According to their website, a McDonald’s Big Mac contains 69 ingredients and McDonald’s fries contain 46 different ingredients. The next time you think about eating a hand-sized taco or burrito at Taco Bell, ask yourself, “Is this a taco or burrito or is it a chemical dump site that I am going to eat?” Sadly, Taco Bell has chosen to brag about its chemical contents instead of offering to change and improve their product. The simple fact is that until fast foods chains stop using steroid-pumped, factory farmed beef, caged in at least ankle-deep urine soaked manure that requires the insertion of ammonia to stop the E. coli bacteria, Americans will suffer from increased weight gain, obesity and ultimately illness or disease. If you would like to understand what these ingredients are and how they cause weight gain, food addiction, obesity and illness, you can find this information in our books contained in valuable charts and explained at length in the text.

Questions Resources (by Bruce Schreiner and Sarah Skidmore, WashingtonTimes.com) AP - Taco Bell launch[ed] an advertising campaign Friday to fight back against a lawsuit charging its taco filling isn’t beef. The fast-food chain placed full-page print ads in Friday’s editions of the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, New York Times and other papers as well as online ads to “set the record straight,” company President Greg Creed told The Associated Press. The print ads say, in huge letters, “Thank you for suing us. Here’s the truth about our seasoned beef.” They go on to outline the meat’s ingredients. The chain did not say how much it is spending on the campaign, but such ads in national newspapers can cost more than $100,000. The class-action lawsuit was filed late last week in federal court in California. It claimed Taco Bell falsely advertised its products as “beef.” The suit alleges that the fast-food chain actually uses a meat mixture in its burritos and tacos that contains binders and extenders and does not meet requirements set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to be labeled beef. Taco Bell quickly denied the accusation. “The lawsuit is bogus and filled with completely inaccurate facts,” Taco Bell President Creed said in an interview. The lawsuit, filed by the Alabama law firm Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis & Miles, doesn’t specify what percentage of the mixture is meat. But the firm’s attorney Dee Miles said the firm had the product tested and found it contained less than 35 percent beef. The firm would not say who tested the meat or give any other specifics of the analysis. Taco Bell says its seasoned beef contains 88 percent USDA-inspected beef and the rest is water, spices and a mixture of oats, starch and other ingredients that contribute to the “quality of its product.” The company said it uses no extenders. Still, the company couldn’t ignore the case after it made headlines and quickly spread online. “This is one of those things that could be a humongous threat to their brand, which is why Taco Bell has taken such an aggressive stance on this,” said Marc Williams, an attorney at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough with extensive experience in fast-food litigation. The case, Williams said, is thin in potential legal liability. Lawyers would have to prove that most consumers expect and believe they are getting something other than what Taco Bell actually serves. Most fast-food customers, he said, realize taco meat has other ingredients besides beef. And the lawsuit cites U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines for labeling ground beef, which don’t apply to restaurants. The USDA’s rules apply to meat processors – the companies Taco Bell buys its meat from. Tyson Foods Inc., the company’s largest meat supplier, said it mixes and cooks the meat at three USDA-inspected plants and that the meat is tested daily to make sure it meets requirements. Claims of false advertising typically are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. Industry and public relations executives say it’s critical for the company to respond forcefully to head off damage to its reputation. However, most say it’s unlikely to seriously dent Taco Bell’s image or business, which serves 35 million people a week. “I don’t think the impact is going to be all that large,” said Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski. “It lacks the sensationalism of (other cases).” ….. Other restaurants have faced similar cases without being hurt much. Rubio’s Restaurants Inc. faced a lawsuit in 2006 when a disgruntled customer felt that it was misleading people by selling lobster tacos and burritos at its Mexican restaurant chain made with langostino, a different species from the classic Maine lobster. The company settled the case by offering California customers coupons. Yum Brands Inc., Taco Bell’s parent company, would not say if there has been any impact on its sales, citing a quiet period before its earnings release on Feb. 3. Fast food generally does contain additives, such as the “isolated oat product” (usually used as a flavor and moisture enhancer) found in Taco Bell’s meat, but experts say they’re no different than whats in processed foods sold in stores. “There is nothing really frankenfood in here,” said Karen Ansel, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. “These are in a lot of foods we eat.” The lawsuit doesn’t specify monetary damages but asks the court to order Taco Bell to stop marketing it under its current terms. “That leads me to believe it’s more about generating publicity and legal fees for a lawyer than correcting a societal wrong,” Williams said.

Check out this article, which says the USDA standards for quality and safety of school lunches are lower than the ones fast-food restaurants use.   Whenever we buy a product, we're relying on both the company being honest with us about its contents as well as government regulations that do not always have the best interests of the consumer in mind. This goes not just for food, but for all manner of products from toothpaste to makeup.   The most common arguments in favor of such products revolve around cost and convenience. All right, let's look at those.   At what cost? For comparison's sake, I took a look at Taco Bell's value menu. An 89-cent five-layer burrito, which you may also have to pay tax on, weighs 248 grams. I weighed one of my homemade bean burritos out of the freezer. The weight was 340 grams. It costs 20 cents.   What about something "better"? I compared Taco Bell's Chicken Ranch Taco Salad with our own burrito bowls. The Taco Bell salad weighs 420 grams, while my homemade version weighs about 470 grams (excluding the bowl). The homemade one costs $2.25, while the Taco Bell version costs $5.69 plus tax.   And think of the "meat" you're getting in that "bargain." (I've made similar comparisons in the past with McDonald's in my sights.)   I think it's fairly clear at this point that there are huge cost savings that can be found from being more involved in the things you consume. The best solution is to stick with the most basic ingredients possible. Don't settle for whatever prepackaged meal has a tasty picture on the box.   Not enough time? A big challenge facing everyone is the issue of time. People eat at fast-food restaurants because it's convenient and it takes time to prepare your own food.   The phenomenon of convenience, from my experience, comes down to time and energy bottlenecks. Weekdays are often very tight, with work, three young children to attend to, and regular household upkeep as well. The convenience of eating a premade meal is very tempting because it allows us to conserve energy and time for other purposes.   At other times, though, we have large windows of time -- when we can improve the options we have during those time bottlenecks.   I prepare healthy food with good ingredients in advance so I don't have to exert a ton of energy or thought when we need a meal -- just toss it in the oven and go. This enables me to enjoy convenience without losing quality.   It pays off This concept can apply throughout life. Rather than channel surf, I'll find good programming to watch and add it to the Netflix queue so I don't have to think when I'm bottlenecked -- just click and go.   The same philosophy explains why it's worthwhile to install a programmable thermostat (it saves you money whether you're pinched for time and energy or not).   In the end, if everything else evens out, the long-term factors win out. If you consistently consume healthier food, you increase your chances for good health throughout life. If you consistently entertain yourself with things that challenge your mind (at least gently), you increase your ability to think through situations as well as having a warehouse of knowledge that can help.   You're rewarded with lower health care costs and greater long-term earning opportunities.   Convenience can be a very good thing. It can help us survive some of the time and energy bottlenecks that modern life foists upon us. The problem with convenience, though, is that it can often lead us into higher-cost and questionable choices like Taco Bell's meat product.   TV wasteland We can combat this by simply planning ahead a little bit. Turn on some music this Saturday and make a batch of burritos for the freezer so you're not left with a fast-food stop this week. Install a programmable thermostat so you don't have to remember to adjust the thermostat every time you go to bed, get up, or leave for work.   Seek out some documentaries or other programming on topics that really excite you and record them so that the next time you flop on the couch, you can just hit a buttion and watch something fulfilling instead of channel surfing through a wasteland.   You eat healthier. You save money. You don't lose convenience. And you're not left eating "meat filling." It's a win all around.   More from The Simple Dollar and MSN Money: Some thoughts on product placement What you're buying when you go to a store Prepare you own skillet meals in advance What's the beef about Taco Bell?

Skip to Main Content USA TODAY ' + blocks.title + ' Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Inflation in China, Taco Bell lawsuit harry Yum By Bruce Schreiner, Associated Press Posted |   |    Share LOUISVILLE  Though it is craving a repeat of its 2010 performance, the owner of the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC chains is facing distasteful developments: inflation in China and a lawsuit challenging a staple ingredient at Taco Bell. By Ric Francis, AP Yum Brands said a Taco Bell lawsuit has hurt the brand temporarily. Enlarge Close By Ric Francis, AP Yum Brands said a Taco Bell lawsuit has hurt the brand temporarily. Yum Brands (YUM) executives said on a conference call with investors Thursday that they're bracing for commodity and wage inflation in the company's fast-growing China operation, its most profitable. Yum recently raised prices there to help offset the higher costs. MORE: Taco Bell fights beef charges with 'truth' ads, may countersue HOW MUCH BEEF? Taco Bell in a beef over meat filling Louisville-based Yum said it's confident of weathering the higher expenses in China, where it has more than 3,900 restaurants that have made KFC a leading fast-food brand internationally. "I feel comfortable operating in that environment, even though it will keep us on our toes," Chief Financial Officer Rick Carucci said on the call. Yum said its operating profit rose 26% last year in China, adjusted for currency fluctuations, and the company is on its way toward $1 billion in annual operating profit there. "We continue to believe we're in the early innings ... of growth in China," Yum Chairman and CEO David Novak said during the conference call. The company said it's also bracing for commodity inflation around the world in 2011. Yum said Wednesday that in 2010 it earned $1.16 billion, or $2.38 a share, compared with $1.07 billion, or $2.22 a share, in 2009. Its revenue was $11.34 billion, up from $10.84 billion in 2009. For 2011, analysts on average are expecting Yum to earn $2.83 per share on revenue of $11.77, according to FactSet. Yum executives outlined their strategy for the coming year a day after the company said its fourth-quarter net income rose 27% with strong growth overseas and a rebound in the U.S. Yum said its earnings per share rose 17% for the year, excluding one-time items, its best performance ever. In the U.S., where the chain has struggled as recession-weary consumers have stayed home to eat more often, Taco Bell appears prime for expansion, Novak said. Its restaurant count here could grow to about 8,000 from the current 5,000, Novak said. Taco Bell already accounts for about 60% of Yum's profits in the U.S. The chain is testing a breakfast menu and looking at offering higher-priced dinner items. Novak hit back at a false-advertising lawsuit filed against Taco Bell over the meat in its tacos. He said the allegations that its taco filling doesn't have enough beef to merit the name are "absolutely false" but acknowledged the lawsuit has hurt the chain. "Clearly we are seeing a negative, short-term impact," Novak said. "We believe we turned the tide with our aggressive response, and will wait and see the ultimate impact." Taco Bell took out full-page ads in several major newspapers last week and launched a YouTube campaign featuring its president to proclaim its taco filling is 88% beef. The other 12%, the company says, contains a mixture of spices and common food additives. The lawsuit, filed the week before in federal court in California, alleges the filling has binders and extenders and does not meet federal requirements to be labeled beef.

By: Tanya Jolliffe, SparkPeople Blogger 2/3/2011 5:30 AM   :  43 comments   :  15,422 Views See More: news, fast food, , While fast food isn't typically the healthiest option, sometimes it is necessary when you are on the go. For this reason, our Food on the Run series attempts to provide you with helpful information to make nutrient wise choices when eating away from home. Last week there was a firestorm of news stories about a lawsuit against Taco Bell. Apparently, an Alabama law firm filed a class action suit claiming false advertising. While Taco Bell states their tacos are filled with "seasoned ground beef," the lawsuit contends they should be using the term "taco meat filling" instead. With news stories of this nature, what are consumers to think? Lawsuits can be successful and influential tools that create change as seen by the recent lawsuit against McDonald's Happy Meal toys. In this case it seems the law firm had the meat mixture analyzed and found a variety of other ingredients they call fillers, binders and extenders that caused them to file the suit. Many of the news articles have cited the United States Department of Agriculture definition that "ground beef can have seasonings, but no water, phosphates, extenders, or binders added." However, these standards are related to the packaging and retail sales of meat and not to its preparation and use in food. The lawsuit isn't seeking monetary rewards but simply seeks the mandate of full disclosure of what is in Taco Bell's seasoned beef. Taco Bell has this list of ingredients for their seasoned ground beef on their website. "Beef, Water, Seasoning [Isolated Oat Product, Salt, Chili Pepper, Onion Powder, Tomato Powder, Oats (Wheat), Soy Lecithin, Sugar, Spices, Maltodextrin, Soybean Oil (Anti-dusting Agent), Garlic Powder, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Citric Acid, Caramel Color, Cocoa Powder (Processed With Alkali), Silicon Dioxide, Natural Flavors, Yeast, Modified Corn Starch, Natural Smoke Flavor], Salt, Sodium Phosphates." They have also clearly stated on their website, "Our beef is 100% USDA inspected, just like the quality beef you would buy in a supermarket and prepare in your home. It then is slow-cooked and simmered with proprietary seasonings and spices to provide Taco Bell's signature taste and texture. Our seasoned beef recipe contains 88% quality USDA-inspected beef and 12% seasonings, spices, water and other ingredients that provide taste, texture and moisture. Our seasoned beef contains no "extenders" to add volume, as some might use." They have even taken out a full-page ad and posted a YouTube video response all in an attempt to openly share information in order to preserve their brand. The Bottom Line It will be interesting to follow this story to see where it goes. It will also be interesting to see how the lawsuit turns out. Perhaps it will bring attention to the fast food industry and its use of food additives. Maybe it will do nothing more than cause people to take notice of what they are eating and make a shift in their fast food behavior. Regardless of how the lawsuit turns out, being aware of what you put in your body is always a good recommendation and would be a terrific outcome of this news story. The best way to know what you are eating is to make it yourself. When it comes to making your own seasoned ground beef, select ground meat from a local grocery store meat department or butcher. You can also grind your own from a purchased cut of lean meat. Use a combination of seasonings such as chili powder, paprika, ground cumin, garlic powder and onion powder to create lean and tasty seasoned ground beef for your favorite Tex-Mex recipe. When it comes to eating away from home, here are a few things you may also want to keep in mind. Check restaurant nutrition and ingredient information before visiting whenever possible to help you make an informed decision. Reserve visits to restaurants for special occasions or while traveling so you are only frequenting occasionally. When possible select nutrition minded and popular local restaurants over nationwide chain restaurants. This increases the likelihood of receiving wholesome products although it certainly doesn't guarantee it. Does news like this make you take a closer look at what you eat? What are your favorite Tex-Mex recipes that you make at home?   You will earn 5 SparkPoints   Like what you read? Learn more about SparkPeople, or sign up for your free account today!

When the story first appeared it made me think twice - again. I love Mexican food. My favorites are homemade chicken fajitas with lots of onions and bell peppers; and homemade chicken tamales made with green sauce and corn tortillas with a strong corn flavor. Totally yum. - 2/6/2011   8:03:49 PM Report Inappropriate Comment SHAPINUPNOW 41 I rarely eat fast food anymore because everything is TOO SALTY or unnecessarily sweet! I never liked salty foods but could easily find menu items at restaurants that were not over salted when I was younger. I used to love sugar, but that too was rare in most main dishes. Now one can't avoid being over dosed with sodium and sugar in every entrée no matter where you eat out! I have found that I am most satisfied with my own cooking! Preparing meals from all fresh and unprocessed ingredients is so much better tasting and healthier! If I see something new I might try to replicate it in my own kitchen rather than be disappointed by the fast food fare. It ALWAYS looks better in the ad than it looks and tastes in real life!! I discovered there are other flavors in food other than salt and sugar -- I really don't miss them anymore. There is so much vitality and variety in eating a diet primarily of living foods! - 2/6/2011   2:58:49 PM Report Inappropriate Comment JOS_SPARK 40 I used to eat Taco Bell all the time, then I stopped eating fast food for a few years. I had a craving for Taco Bell and got a taco....all I can say is BLECK! - 2/6/2011   1:23:26 PM Report Inappropriate Comment ZILCHIE 39 I love Taco Bell! It always makes me feel good when I eat it. That said, I don't eat it often. I agree with the person who said thanks a lot, this is just going to make my occasional trip to Taco Bell cost more. Worthless law suits are good for no one. - 2/5/2011   1:13:29 PM Report Inappropriate Comment GAARAMA 38 Before Spark I ate at Taco Bell,now I think twice before eating fast food. As long as there are customers there will always be fast food. Cheap food maybe easy on the budget but at what cost to ones health. Since Spark entered my life I have gone back to the basics of eating meals cooked at home. No more processed food for me. I make my tacos out of a tender cut of beef,throw it on the grill,slice it put a little on a warm corn tortilla. Top it off with diced onion,chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice. To spice it up I add home made salsa and a slice of avocado. This is my favorite way to enjoy a taco. - 2/5/2011   11:34:22 AM Report Inappropriate Comment LEONALIONESS 37 I love that people are up in arms and so "grossed out". OH NOES, there are OATS and SOY in my meat! Please. Please! If you use a seasoning packet to flavor your cow at home I'm sure it has quite a lot of ingredients in common with the Taco Bell seasoning. Hell, you can BUY dry packages of TB seasoning in conventional stores. Honestly, I'd 100% rather eat the (plant based) fillers than the beef. Most importantly because I don't eat animals, period, secondarily because that meat is low quality, factory farmed and probably doused in ammonia. Mmmm. Taco Bell, ditch the meat entirely and make it all oats! Joe's Oat Patties are delicious vegan burgers primarily of oats and quinoa. It'll be cost effective AND better for the fast food eating population out there. Obviously ya'll don't need 100% meat to enjoy your food... And, with more brutal honesty, I'm glad it's not 100% meat. Every % of it that's plant based = less animal suffering. - 2/4/2011   6:14:11 PM Report Inappropriate Comment ELECTRALYTE 36 I don't eat fast food and I think the people that do, don't really care what's in it. - 2/4/2011   2:57:34 PM Report Inappropriate Comment TWO_SPARROWS 35 Any time I've seen the tacos prepared by Taco Bell (I think they're horrid-tasting, but that's my own tastebuds) when someone I know buys one, I am always left wondering just how they determine what is in there? There isn't really enough of what they call "meat" to test! - 2/4/2011   2:32:27 PM Report Inappropriate Comment DISCIPLINE_DOES 34 Sad, but while I know that fast food is bad, I never really thought about the ingredients. I always thought more of the preparation side of things (fried, greasy, etc). Thanks for this! - 2/4/2011   1:53:44 PM Report Inappropriate Comment LESLIE56 33 I'm not into fast food chains, really, you never know, if the food is healthy. Never mind the awful ingredients, the calories are wicked. We used to have a taco bell, and no-one went there, and it has since closed. McDonalds' is still going strong. - 2/4/2011   1:43:59 PM Report Inappropriate Comment TOWHEE 32 My first reaction to this story was "oh, boy, here's another law practice trying to make a name for itself". Want to bet that prices at Taco Bell go up because of the litigation? As far as the meat is concerned, if the meat doesn't look like something the butcher or the farmer would sell you, then it's "mystery meat", whether prepared at a fast food restaurant or the swankiest of local restaurants. - 2/4/2011   1:22:22 PM Report Inappropriate Comment JAYRIC 31 I think I've eaten at Taco Bell once in my life. - 2/4/2011   1:07:51 PM Report Inappropriate Comment MISSM66 30 I never eat fast food much less taco, I eat very Healthy so I don't have to worry about any taco,I eat real food. - 2/4/2011   11:49:35 AM Report Inappropriate Comment MARYJEANSL 29 If I really want a taco, which is very rare, I choose a local (non-chain)restaurant whose quality I can trust.

It helps you see it better and makes you think there is more meat than there really is. This trompe l'oeil effect makes the stomach feel fuller faster.

Really? I am constantly on the go, and we NEVER eat fast food. Really. And "Our beef is 100% USDA inspected, just like the quality beef you would buy in a supermarket and prepare in your home." Um - since when has the CAFO beef in the supermarkets been "quality?" No, thanks. I'm in complete agreement with this, though: "The best way to know what you are eating is to make it yourself." And use beef from a local, sustainable, humane farmer who employs a humane, small-scale abattoir to do the processing. - 2/4/2011   5:24:25 AM Report Inappropriate Comment RENIESSPARKIN 24 I admit I've never eaten at Taco Bell. No particular reason. However, my sister-in-law swore there was something in them that made you want to pig out. I have to admit that I have nothing against Fast Foods. Just make careful choices. Another concern is Caramel Color is often made with wheat and would make someone with Celiac Disease go into a world of hurt. There are times when I've called the company who canned things to see how they made their caramel coloring. Just some thoughts to consider.

I assumed that the bean burrito and grilled chicken taquitos would be among the healthiest items on the menu. i was with a friend and we drove through and I ordered those two items! YIKES!!! The interesting thing was I had asked my friend to drive through McD's so I could get a garden wrap...learned I should have stuck with my gut... Taco Bell meal more than 700 calories McDonald's would've been 320!!! - 2/4/2011   12:29:31 AM Report Inappropriate Comment LILABE11 21 I really like that this article encourages frequenting local restaurants. When I first started eating healthy, I sometimes sought chains when I went out because they are more likely to have nutrition info posted. Now that I know the calories in food better and can judge portion size, I realize the many local, smaller restaurants in my city are actually offering much more healthful, sustainable food. - 2/3/2011   11:04:46 PM Report Inappropriate Comment ECLIPSED 20 I used to eat the chicken burrito, had no clue what was in it!

Beef has plenty of moisture, and 'texture' sounds a lot like 'extender' in a new wardrobe to me. I've not eaten at taco bell (or almost any ff chain) since I was an undergrad, and more concerned about budget than health. - 2/3/2011   8:51:04 AM Report Inappropriate Comment BUZEELADY 5 Staying away from fast food ~ seems safer that way! - 2/3/2011   8:36:55 AM Report Inappropriate Comment PUM088KIN 4 The beef package at Taco Bell says Grade D Beef, still good for human consumption!
