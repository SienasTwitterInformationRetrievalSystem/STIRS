User Reviews   The Middle The Name 28 March 2013 | by dalydj-918-255175 (Ireland) – See all my reviews The episode ends with to be continued as we see Axl facing problems in his relationship with Cassie whom he might lose. Molly Shannon was great on the show once again because of her chemistry with Patricia Heaton. Sue wanted to change her name which seemed very stressful for her which was funny for a bit of the episode. Aunt Janet coming back to the show was fun especially since Heaton and Shannon are almost near perfect casting as sisters. The show doesn't do much episodes with a to be continued banner at the end of the episode so I wonder if Axl will get Cassie back because Ithink they make a nice couple on the show.

User Reviews   The Middle The Smile 8 February 2013 | by dalydj-918-255175 (Ireland) – See all my reviews Brick is looking for his Ipad which seems confusing for this family. Flashback to Brick making his parents at the thought of buying him this expensive device. Axl still has heard nothing from College and Sue is finally noticed by a teacher in school. Sue is made do a project worth 40% of her final grade. Brick continues to ask and is still told no. Sue try's to prove her smiling experiment with Brad but he smiles all the time, then she goes up the halls and no one smiles at her. Frankie and Mike now worry about Axl's future because still no answer while most other people do. Then Axl gets the text and has his place in college but he still must graduate. Brick continues to ask and with this good news Axl wants to go out with the family to celebrate. The family go out and when Axl try's to give his news to many distractions come and he is unable to tell them having to tell his parents at home as if it meant nothing for them to hear. Axl is not as stressed now and has an idea for the senior prank. Brick has said nothing about the Ipad for sometime and this gives Frankie and Mike the time to agree and get the Ipad. The guys go to do their prank and without paint they decide to sit down look over the small town thinking about their great past and how it did not suck. Sue gives her smile project to the harsh teacher and while he reads her words he seems to be liking it more then she would have thought. This was a boring episode and most of the jokes did not play well for me. Sue was nice but she can always make me laugh unlike in this episode.

Exclusive Exclusive: ABC's The Middle Recruits 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer for Toothsome Arc By Kimberly Roots / February 15 2013, 5:21 PM PDT 20 Here’s a reason to show off your pearly whites with glee: Jack McBrayer is about to hang out with the Hecks. In his first role since wrapping 30 Rock last month, McBrayer will play a dentist who hires The Middle‘s Frankie as his hygienist, TVLine has learned exclusively. RELATED | TVLine’s 2013 Renewal Scorecard: What’s Coming Back? What’s Getting Cancelled? What’s on the Bubble? McBrayer’s Dr. Ted Goodwin is described as boyish and disheveled, and we’re hearing he may be around for more than one episode of the ABC comedy. McBrayer played 30 Rock‘s (probably immortal) NBC page Kenneth for seven seasons. His other TV credits include Arrested Development and Portlandia.

Reply Leah says: February 15, 2013 at 7:52 PM I’m with you. He’s great. And so is The Middle. Reply brutony says: February 16, 2013 at 8:10 PM NAY! Reply Lynn says: February 15, 2013 at 6:23 PM Dear god, no!! Reply brutony says: February 16, 2013 at 9:55 AM Im sorry to say, but it IS so! This guy grates on my last nerve! Loathe him so much, he ruined 30 Rock for me, when they seemed to expand his role-WTF would a page have to do with the plotline of a neurotic head writer on a struggling comedy show? But perfect for him to go on this mess-The Middle is now truly the Bottom! Reply Mike says: February 16, 2013 at 11:43 AM What the hell, I’ll ignore your totally rude and wrong statements about Mcbrayer, but the Middle is definitely better than Modern Family(nowadays) and The Neighbors, it’s only competition comedy wise on ABC is Happy Endings and Suburgatory. Reply brutony says: February 16, 2013 at 12:22 PM You’ll ignore my comments about Mac Breyer? Yeah, maybe if we ignore him he’ll go away! And The Middle sucks- can’t even touch MF on its worst night! Reply Mike says: February 16, 2013 at 12:39 PM Ridiculous, MF jumped the shark a season ago. It’s repetititive and boring now. You are the reason why we can’t have quality shows. brutony says: February 16, 2013 at 1:44 PM Yes, u discovered the reason- I’M the reason why u can’t have quality shows anymore- great stuff like 30 Rock. The Middle and Downton Abbey- wait, that last one is the only true comedy here! Mike says: February 16, 2013 at 11:57 PM 30 Rock was one of the best comedies of the last decade, whether you liked it is subjective but it was great. the Middle is quickly becoming better than the majority of ABCs comedies. What makes your taste so much better than mine. I also assume you will be thrilled when every single quality comedy is cancelled this year. Miffy says: February 15, 2013 at 6:58 PM Ugh – a little of him goes a long way. Reply brutony says: February 16, 2013 at 1:46 PM Not little enough of him, I’m afraid! This asshats like a rash- u don’t scratch it, it gets worse and worse, and eventually spreads! Reply TV Gord says: February 16, 2013 at 2:18 AM I think some people may be expecting him to play Kenneth. His character may be completely different. I think he’s a riot, and I love The Middle, so I’m already Lizzing! :-) Reply PPPG says: February 16, 2013 at 6:29 AM I just searched for him on IMDB and discovered he was born in `73 – two years younger than me. Yet he looks SIGNIFICANTLY younger. I must now hate him with a bitter jealousy! The male ego demands it! ☠ ☠ Reply David4 says: February 16, 2013 at 9:32 AM I think he would work great! it’s not like he will be in all the episodes, depending on how long that job lasts he will be in an episode once and awhile. This will be fun. Reply Belle says: February 16, 2013 at 10:06 AM I think he’s a great addition…and he could so be a dentist, here’s hoping he is Frankie’s boss forEVER!!! Reply Tony says: February 16, 2013 at 10:21 AM So happy about this. Reply Miss M says: February 16, 2013 at 4:50 PM Buried the lede….Frankie’s getting a new job!

Shawn, the elder sibling, owned a newsstand in Manhattan's Neidermeyer Building, where Marlon also worked. Just a few feet away, their father had a diner called Pops' Diner. Over the course of the series, Dee, a security guard who worked in the building, acted as an older sister to the pair. In between, they were occasionally annoyed by White Mike (R.I.P Mitch Mullany), and hung out with T.C. and Dupree.<\/p>\r\n The show was criticized for alleged \"buffoonery,\" but that's far from accurate. A significant part of the show's early comedy came from Marlon, but he demonstrated his serious acting chops, by surprise, leaving the newsstand to chase his dream of being an actor. As for Shawn, he was the entrepreneur, taking after his father.<\/p>\r\n The Wayans Bros.<\/em> enjoyed a five season run on The WB before being unceremoniously cancelled in 1999. As mentioned in Scary Movie<\/em>, it didn't even get the respect of a proper final episode. Still, it's remained popular over a decade after its cancellation, and fans will stop whatever they're doing when the show comes on television, hoping to catch the episode where Pops and his old singing group, The Temptones<\/a>, get back together. \u2014JK<\/a><\/em><\/p>","headline":"41.

The U.S. version of the British show Steptoe and Son<\/em>, Sanford and Son<\/em> gave black America a slightly less abrasive answer to Archie Bunker.

Ali, Janet Hubert-Whitten, Joseph Marcell, Daphne Maxwell Reid, DJ Jazzy Jeff In the fall of 1990, a skinny kid from West Philly decided to try his hand at acting. As rap's first Grammy award-winner, it couldn't be that hard, right? After making a name for himself as a hip-hop star in the '80s, a guy named Will Smith found himself in a bit of a financial bind. Consistent cash would fix that. Enter NBC, and an offer to star in a sitcom loosely based on his own life and that of co-producer Benny Medina, who, after growing up in a rough neighborhood, moved in with a wealthy family in Beverly Hills. You know this story.<\/p>\r\n You know it, because you know the theme song to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air<\/em>. A kid gets into some neighborhood beef that scares his mother so badly she sends him to Cali to live with their wealthy family. There, our hero becomes Public Enemy No. 1 in the Banks' household, except in the eyes of his Aunt Viv and youngest cousin, Ashley. There's preppy cousin Carlton, with his fondness for Tom Jones. There's Uncle Phil, or the Honorable Judge Philip Banks. There's Geoffrey<\/span>, the wry butler. These are the characters you remember.<\/span><\/p>\r\n This is a moment you'll never forget: Will's biological father, Lou, reappears and tries to develop a relationship with his son. Uncle Phil has never respected Lou for abandoning Will and his mother, and doesn't want to see his nephew hurt again. When that happens, just as Phil predicted, the embrace between Will and his uncle goes down as one of the most heart-wrenching television moments of the 20th century<\/a>. You watched Will Smith become an actor, the man who would grow to command millions.<\/p>\r\n During its six-season run on NBC, The French Prince of Bel-Air<\/em> was a juggernaut. Viewers learned the theme song without trying. Smith even allowed \"Summertime,\" his classic track recorded with DJ Jazzy Jeff, to fuel the show's popularity and vice versa. Hell, the legendary DJ landed a role on the show as Will's friend, the one whose undying love for Hilary got him regularly ejected from the Banks' residence.<\/p>\r\n Love for the ladies was a recurring theme, allowing Will to come across some of the baddest women of the time: Stacey Dash, Tyra Banks, Robin Givens, and Nia Long. Furthermore, the The Fresh Prince<\/em> had a storied history of guest appearances that we chronicled right here<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air<\/em> was the perfect complement and eventual successor to The Cosby Show<\/em>, as it depicted an upper-class African-American family that wasn't out of touch with the realities of black America. It wasn't quite as funny as Martin<\/em>, but it dealt with a broader range of subjects. That makes it one of the better television shows of all-time-<\/span>period. -(JK<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>","headline":"12.

Fox was the network to watch back in the 1990s, rivaling the popularity of NBC's \"Must See TV\" block of Thursday night programming with a lineup that drew an engaged urban audience. Between New York Undercover<\/em>, Living Single,<\/em> and Martin<\/em>, Fox's Thursday night lineup ran the triangle offense better than the Chicago Bulls did in the 1990s. During the 1996-1997 television season, these shows were the three highest rated programs among African-American households, with Martin <\/em>serving as the jump-off for one of the best two hours of television ever organized.<\/p>\r\n Comedian and actor Martin Lawrence played Martin Payne, a DJ for WZUP (and eventually the host of his own talk show, \"Word on the Street\"). Central to the show was Martin's relationship with Gina Waters, the large-headed (literally) love of his life. They broke up and got back together throughout the series, but their genuine love provided a complement to the show's constant comedy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n Also important were Martin's relationships with his biggest adversary, Gina's best friend, Pam James, and his two best friends, the comically inept Cole Brown and the tall, bald, and possibly unemployed Tommy Strawn.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n Beyond the central cast, the wild gang of side characters played by Lawrence regularly stole the spotlight. Martin had no problem dressing up in drag to play his too-hood-for-her-own-good neighbor Sheneneh, or Martin's mother, the mustached Mama Payne. Lawrence's other legendary characters include Jerome the has-been Detroit pimp, Dragonfly Jones, Bob from Marketing, Roscoe, and Otis.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n From Jim's Barbershop to Nipsey's Lounge, Martin<\/em> had classic locations where the main cast ran into other hilarious characters, like Tracy Morgan's Hustle Man. Even when Martin retired to the solace of his own home, he couldn't escape unexpected visits from Bruh-man, who climbed through the window before using that infamous slow bop to help himself to whatever he wanted from Martin's apartment. Martin<\/em> also had numerous amazing guest stars like Richard Pryor, Billy Dee Williams, Keith Washington, Snoop Dogg, Tommy Hearns, Randall Cunningham, Method Man, Jodeci, and even Biggie. No<\/em> show is landing cameos like that.<\/p>\r\n Not only was Martin<\/em> instrumental in African-American culture and hip-hop culture, it played a role in popular culture that can't be argued. How else would Complex be able to compose a guide of the show's sneaker history<\/a>? Despite only being on the air for five seasons, Martin<\/em> left behind so many great characters and scenes that kids will be getting disciplined at school forever thanks to syndication. Think about it like this: two decades have passed since the show began, and people are still<\/em> talking about how they \"can't pay the five.\" That says a lot.<\/em> \u2014K<\/a><\/em><\/p>","headline":"6.

Shawn, the elder sibling, owned a newsstand in Manhattan's Neidermeyer Building, where Marlon also worked. Just a few feet away, their father had a diner called Pops' Diner. Over the course of the series, Dee, a security guard who worked in the building, acted as an older sister to the pair. In between, they were occasionally annoyed by White Mike (R.I.P Mitch Mullany), and hung out with T.C. and Dupree.<\/p>\r\n The show was criticized for alleged \"buffoonery,\" but that's far from accurate. A significant part of the show's early comedy came from Marlon, but he demonstrated his serious acting chops, by surprise, leaving the newsstand to chase his dream of being an actor. As for Shawn, he was the entrepreneur, taking after his father.<\/p>\r\n The Wayans Bros.<\/em> enjoyed a five season run on The WB before being unceremoniously cancelled in 1999. As mentioned in Scary Movie<\/em>, it didn't even get the respect of a proper final episode. Still, it's remained popular over a decade after its cancellation, and fans will stop whatever they're doing when the show comes on television, hoping to catch the episode where Pops and his old singing group, The Temptones<\/a>, get back together. \u2014JK<\/a><\/em><\/p>","headline":"41.

Ali, Janet Hubert-Whitten, Joseph Marcell, Daphne Maxwell Reid, DJ Jazzy Jeff In the fall of 1990, a skinny kid from West Philly decided to try his hand at acting. As rap's first Grammy award-winner, it couldn't be that hard, right? After making a name for himself as a hip-hop star in the '80s, a guy named Will Smith found himself in a bit of a financial bind. Consistent cash would fix that. Enter NBC, and an offer to star in a sitcom loosely based on his own life and that of co-producer Benny Medina, who, after growing up in a rough neighborhood, moved in with a wealthy family in Beverly Hills. You know this story.<\/p>\r\n You know it, because you know the theme song to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air<\/em>. A kid gets into some neighborhood beef that scares his mother so badly she sends him to Cali to live with their wealthy family. There, our hero becomes Public Enemy No. 1 in the Banks' household, except in the eyes of his Aunt Viv and youngest cousin, Ashley. There's preppy cousin Carlton, with his fondness for Tom Jones. There's Uncle Phil, or the Honorable Judge Philip Banks. There's Geoffrey<\/span>, the wry butler. These are the characters you remember.<\/span><\/p>\r\n This is a moment you'll never forget: Will's biological father, Lou, reappears and tries to develop a relationship with his son. Uncle Phil has never respected Lou for abandoning Will and his mother, and doesn't want to see his nephew hurt again. When that happens, just as Phil predicted, the embrace between Will and his uncle goes down as one of the most heart-wrenching television moments of the 20th century<\/a>. You watched Will Smith become an actor, the man who would grow to command millions.<\/p>\r\n During its six-season run on NBC, The French Prince of Bel-Air<\/em> was a juggernaut. Viewers learned the theme song without trying. Smith even allowed \"Summertime,\" his classic track recorded with DJ Jazzy Jeff, to fuel the show's popularity and vice versa. Hell, the legendary DJ landed a role on the show as Will's friend, the one whose undying love for Hilary got him regularly ejected from the Banks' residence.<\/p>\r\n Love for the ladies was a recurring theme, allowing Will to come across some of the baddest women of the time: Stacey Dash, Tyra Banks, Robin Givens, and Nia Long. Furthermore, the The Fresh Prince<\/em> had a storied history of guest appearances that we chronicled right here<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air<\/em> was the perfect complement and eventual successor to The Cosby Show<\/em>, as it depicted an upper-class African-American family that wasn't out of touch with the realities of black America. It wasn't quite as funny as Martin<\/em>, but it dealt with a broader range of subjects. That makes it one of the better television shows of all-time-<\/span>period. -(JK<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>","headline":"12.

Fox was the network to watch back in the 1990s, rivaling the popularity of NBC's \"Must See TV\" block of Thursday night programming with a lineup that drew an engaged urban audience. Between New York Undercover<\/em>, Living Single,<\/em> and Martin<\/em>, Fox's Thursday night lineup ran the triangle offense better than the Chicago Bulls did in the 1990s. During the 1996-1997 television season, these shows were the three highest rated programs among African-American households, with Martin <\/em>serving as the jump-off for one of the best two hours of television ever organized.<\/p>\r\n Comedian and actor Martin Lawrence played Martin Payne, a DJ for WZUP (and eventually the host of his own talk show, \"Word on the Street\"). Central to the show was Martin's relationship with Gina Waters, the large-headed (literally) love of his life. They broke up and got back together throughout the series, but their genuine love provided a complement to the show's constant comedy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n Also important were Martin's relationships with his biggest adversary, Gina's best friend, Pam James, and his two best friends, the comically inept Cole Brown and the tall, bald, and possibly unemployed Tommy Strawn.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n Beyond the central cast, the wild gang of side characters played by Lawrence regularly stole the spotlight. Martin had no problem dressing up in drag to play his too-hood-for-her-own-good neighbor Sheneneh, or Martin's mother, the mustached Mama Payne. Lawrence's other legendary characters include Jerome the has-been Detroit pimp, Dragonfly Jones, Bob from Marketing, Roscoe, and Otis.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n From Jim's Barbershop to Nipsey's Lounge, Martin<\/em> had classic locations where the main cast ran into other hilarious characters, like Tracy Morgan's Hustle Man. Even when Martin retired to the solace of his own home, he couldn't escape unexpected visits from Bruh-man, who climbed through the window before using that infamous slow bop to help himself to whatever he wanted from Martin's apartment. Martin<\/em> also had numerous amazing guest stars like Richard Pryor, Billy Dee Williams, Keith Washington, Snoop Dogg, Tommy Hearns, Randall Cunningham, Method Man, Jodeci, and even Biggie. No<\/em> show is landing cameos like that.<\/p>\r\n Not only was Martin<\/em> instrumental in African-American culture and hip-hop culture, it played a role in popular culture that can't be argued. How else would Complex be able to compose a guide of the show's sneaker history<\/a>? Despite only being on the air for five seasons, Martin<\/em> left behind so many great characters and scenes that kids will be getting disciplined at school forever thanks to syndication. Think about it like this: two decades have passed since the show began, and people are still<\/em> talking about how they \"can't pay the five.\" That says a lot.<\/em> \u2014K<\/a><\/em><\/p>","headline":"6.

WARNER BROS. TELEVISION MEDIA DEPOT HOME Shows Photos news events publicists The New Yorker Talks ‘The Middle’ & Working Class Sitcoms March 12th, 2013 12:46pm | Tags: season 4, The Middle Bookmark on Delicious Digg this Recommend on Facebook Share via MySpace Share on Reddit Share with Stumblers Tweet this Follow this posts comments Just how great is ‘The Middle‘? The New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum answers that question and dives into the humor, warmth, and gutsiness of the series.   For sitcom snobs, it’s been a rough winter. “30 Rock” aired its finale. “Don’t Trust the B” tanked. New episodes of ABCs “Happy Endings”–witty en­semble series that looks like “Friends” but  tastes like “Seinfeld”–have been booted to late March. The networks are delivering sound bites about broad com­edy, nostalgia for Must-See TV-that kind of thing.   To be fair you could write this lament every year: like Broadway, the sitcom is eternally the subject of premature obitu­aries. But, rather than dwell in bitterness, or gang up on NBCs struggling reboot of “Community,” we might turn our attention to two excellent sitcoms rarely mentioned in quality-comedy conversation: “The Middle’ created by Eileen Heisler and DeAnn Heline, and “Raising Hope,” created by Greg Garcia. Both are family comedies, set in small towns. Both focus on lower-middle-class families, a rarity on television. These comedies are no-non­sense on the topic of money; they dwell on social class, rather than ignore it like most network shows. Mostly, they’re just funny and original creations, albeit easy to mis­take for corny at first glance.   “The Middle,” now in its fourth season on ABC, is about two worn-out work­ing parents, Frankie and Mike Heck; their teen-agers, Sue and Axl; and their “quirky” younger son, Brick. The show is often compared to the nineties sitcom “Malcolm in the Middle,” because it, too, featured an odd kid. There’s a major difference, however: while Malcolm was gifted, Brick (Atticus Shaffer) is smart but special-needs, with attention problems, social issues, and tics that include a habit of whispering a word after he’s said it. On NBC’s “Parenthood,” an upper-middle­ all class couple throw their resources toward their son with Asperger’s; on “The­ Middle,” Bricks’ parents just want to know if his school-mandated therapies are free. When Brick gets angry, he com­ plains that Frankie has given up when it comes to him: “You don’t care. You don’t have anything left. You don’t even have enough energy to yell at me.”   This sounds like a downer, and the show has a brassy look that can put new viewers off, while it’s shot with a single camera, like many hip modem comedies, it has the aggression of an old-fashioned multi-cam, with bright lighting and emphatic musical stings. That vibe is mis­leading, though: “The Middle” is a stealthily sophisticated show, with warm elements that are ballasted by its bleak ex­istential center. The show’s most unset­tling character is its narrator Frankie Heck (Patricia Heaton), whose motto is “You do for family.” Heisler and Heline both wrote for “Roseanne,” but unlike that show’s iconic mom-or Malcolm’s mom, Lois- Frankie isn’t so much a charismatic steamroller as an antenna shuddering with anxiety. Convinced that her family consists of mediocrities­ “eenie” people, the ones who never get to “moe”–she’s got endless plans to improve their lives, but, as with her prede­cessor, Lucille Ball, these well-intentioned schemes tend to blow up in her face.   “The Middle” features two of the most realistic teen-age kids on television, both played by stellar physical comedians. As the football jock Axl, Charlie McDermott is a sulky rubber band who throws himself over sofas, like the boneless cat in “Pea­nuts.” Eden Sher gives an even more fear­ less performance as Axl’s younger sister, Sue, a spaz in rainbow prints. Barrelling into rejection, Sue is like a braces-faced sister to “Enlightened”‘s Amy Jellicoe and “Saturday Night Live”‘s Mary Katherine Gallagher. “I suggest buying a wacky hat and starting your cat collection now,” Axl snarls at his sister. “That’s not even an insult;’ Sue replies. “I love cats.” Her resilience (her computer password is “I Heart Trying”) keeps “The Middle” from ever turning sour. When the character does have a breakthrough—as when she performs a defiant, arm-wriggling dance with her off-brand cheer ream, the Wres­tlerettes-it’s thrilling. A recent kiss was one of TV’s loveliest romantic moments.   But if Sue is the shows’ breakout char­acter, there’s an equal originality to her father, the taciturn Mike (Neil Flynn); his brand of masculinity is rare among men on sitcoms, who rend to be as neurotic as L.A. TV writers. The manager at a quarry, Mike is skeptical of Frankie’s Oprah-ringed ideas. Yet he’s nor a rough guy or a bully; he’s a product of his ex­ tended family, which includes his even more reclusive father and his dysfunc­tional leech of a brother. (Unlike most shows, “The Middle” regularly features extended family; it’s also unusual in show­ing the local church in a positive light.) Like Frankie, Mike is ground down by responsibility, more so since Frankie lost her job. They’re drowning in credit-card debt; they couldn’t afford Christmas gifts; and, when a tree branch wrecked their car, the insurance company refused to call it act of God. The tighter the financial vise gets, the more Mike’s manner comes across as healthy realism: unlike Frankie, he accepts life’s limits.   This season’s opening episode was set during a summer that Frankie kept trying to turn into a perfect memory. In July, however, she stumbled on an upsetting revelation: her kids have a favorite parent, and it’s not her. At the Fourth of July picnic that Frankie had planned and prepared, she lay fuming, next to her si­lent family, as fireworks exploded in the distance, out of their view. That episode had plenty of jokes and warmth–and, as always, Frankie was able to scrapbook her memories in the end-but that moment felt legitimately painful. It was the sort of jagged note that “The Middle” lets linger, and which also marks it as one of the gutsier shows television has produced about family life.   Read Nussbaum further discuss ‘Raising Hope’ and the Hecks at the source (must have subscription).   Don’t forget, you can watch the Hecks in new episodes Wednesdays 8/7c on ABC!   Source: The New Yorker Recent News Warner Bros.
