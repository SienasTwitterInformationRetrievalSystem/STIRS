Most of those hurt, in the Chelyabinsk region where meteorites fell, suffered cuts and bruises but at least 46 remain in hospital. A fireball streaked through the clear morning sky, followed by loud bangs. President Vladimir Putin said he thanked God no big fragments had fallen in populated areas. A large meteorite landed in a lake near Chebarkul, a town in Chelyabinsk region. The meteor's dramatic passing was witnessed in Yekaterinburg, 200km (125 miles) to the north, and in Kazakhstan, to the south.

"We saw a very bright light and then there was a kind of a track, white and yellow in the sky." "The explosion was so strong that some windows in our building and in the buildings that are across the road and in the city in general, the windows broke." Officials say a large meteor partially burned up in the lower atmosphere, resulting in a number of meteorites falling earthwards. Thousands of rescue workers have been dispatched to the area to provide help to the injured, the emergencies ministry said. The Chelyabinsk region, about 1,500km (930 miles) east of Moscow, is home to many factories, a nuclear power plant and the Mayak atomic waste storage and treatment centre.

One Russian politician said the event was not a meteor shower but a US weapons test, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, was quoted as saying: "Meteors are falling. Those are not meteors, it is Americans testing their new weapon." 'Blinding' Chelyabinsk's health department said 985 people had sought medical treatment, including 204 children, Interfax reported. Two people in the town of Kopeysk were in a serious condition, it added. The governor of Chelyabinsk region, Mikhail Yurevich, was quoted elsewhere as saying 950 people had been hurt, two seriously. Mr Putin promised "immediate" aid for people affected, saying kindergartens and schools had been damaged, and work disrupted at industrial enterprises. Many children were at lessons when the meteor fell at around 09:20 (03:20 GMT). Video posted online showed frightened, screaming youngsters at one Chelyabinsk school, where corridors were littered with broken glass. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Footage shows an icy lake near Chebarkul, where police say a meteorite landed Chelyabinsk resident Sergei Serskov told BBC News the city had felt like a "war zone" for 20 to 30 minutes. "I was in the office when suddenly I saw a really bright flash in the window in front of me," he said. "Then I smelt fumes. I looked out the window and saw a huge line of smoke, like you get from a plane but many times bigger." "A few minutes later the window suddenly came open and there was a huge explosion, followed by lots of little explosions." In Yekaterinburg, 36-year-old resident Viktor Prokofiev was driving to work when he witnessed the event. The meteor glimpsed from a satellite "It was quite dark, but it suddenly became as bright as if it was day," he was quoted by Reuters as saying. "I felt like I was blinded by headlights." Debris also reportedly fell on the west Siberian region of Tyumen. Governor Yurevich reported that a meteorite had landed in a lake 1km outside Chebarkul, which has a population of 46,000. A Russian army spokesman said a crater 6m (20ft) wide had been found on the shore of the lake. Asteroid coincidence The Russian Academy of Sciences estimates that the meteor weighed about 10 tonnes and entered the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of at least 54,000 km/h (33,000mph). It would have shattered about 30-50km (18-32 miles) above ground, with most of the meteor burning up. Scientists have played down suggestions that there is any link between the event in the Urals and 2012 DA14, an asteroid passing the Earth on Friday at a distance of just 27,700km (17,200 miles) - the closest ever predicted for an object of that size. Prof Alan Fitzsimmons, of the Astrophysics Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast, said there was "almost definitely" no connection. "One reason is that 2012 DA14 is approaching Earth from the south, and this object hit in the northern hemisphere," he told BBC News. "This is literally a cosmic coincidence, although a spectacular one." Such meteor strikes are rare in Russia but one is thought to have devastated an area of more than 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles) in Siberia in 1908.

Skip to main content LOADING... Loading ... Text Size Russia Meteor Not Linked to Asteroid Flyby February 15, 2013   A meteor seen flying over Russia on Feb. 15 at 3:20: 26 UTC impacted Chelyabinsk. Preliminary information is that this object was unrelated to asteroid 2012 DA14, which made a safe pass by Earth today. Image credit: Google Earth, NASA/JPL-Caltech › Larger view     &nbsp › Related telecon   This image from D. Herald of Murrumbateman, Australia, shows the asteroid 2012 DA14 as a tiny speck in the center of the field of view. Image credit: D. Herald › Full image and caption -> Update: March 21, 2013 The large fireball (technically, called a "superbolide") observed on the morning of Feb. 15, 2013, in the skies near Chelyabinsk, Russia, was caused by a relatively small asteroid approximately 17 to 20 meters in size (about 18.6 to 21.9 yards) that entered Earth's atmosphere at high speed and at a shallow angle. In doing so, it released a tremendous amount of energy, fragmented at high altitude, and produced a shower of pieces of various sizes that fell to the ground as meteorites. The fireball was observed not only by video cameras and low-frequency infrasound detectors, but also by U.S. government sensors. Information on the composition of the meteor was also derived from meteorite fragments found in the Chelyabinsk area. With this new data incorporated, the details of the impact have become clearer. At 9:20:20 a.m. local time (3:20:20 UTC) the meteor entered Earth's atmosphere over the Kazakhstan/Russia border. As it descended through the upper atmosphere, it traveled northwest into Russia. The impactor's trajectory approached Earth along a direction that remained within 15 degrees of the direction of the sun. Asteroid detection telescopes cannot scan regions of the sky this close to the sun. During the atmospheric entry phase, an impacting object is both slowed and heated by atmospheric friction. In front of it, a bow shock develops where atmospheric gases are compressed and heated. Some of this energy is radiated to the object, causing it to ablate, and in most cases, break apart. Fragmentation increases the amount of atmosphere intercepted and so enhances ablation and atmospheric braking. The object disintegrates when the force from the unequal pressures on the front and back sides exceeds its tensile strength. This disruption, or disintegration, usually occurs around the time of maximum brightness. Thirteen seconds after atmospheric entry, at 9:20:33 a.m. local time (03:20:33 UTC), the fireball, traveling at a velocity of 11.6 miles per second (18.6 kilometers per second), achieved its maximum brightness just south of Chelyabinsk, Russia, at an altitude of 14.5 miles (23.3 kilometers). The approximate effective diameter of the asteroid is estimated to be about 18 meters (about 19.7 yards), and its mass about 11,000 tons. Approximate total impact energy of the Chelyabinsk Fireball, in kilotons of TNT explosives (the energy parameter usually quoted for a fireball), is 440 kilotons. Note that these estimates of total energy, diameter and mass are very approximate. The Chelyabinsk event was an extraordinarily large fireball, the most energetic impact event recognized since the 1908 Tunguska blast in Russian Siberia. The U.S. government sensor data also provides an approximate path for the Chelyabinsk impactor. A similar calculation can be made from analysis of video records of the event; both methods yield similar results. This path through the atmosphere reinforces that the fireball was not associated with asteroid 2012 DA14, which made a very close flyby of Earth just over 16 hours later. This is known because the two objects approached the Earth from completely different directions and had entirely different orbits around the sun. And, their compositions are dissimilar. The meteorite fragments emanating from the fireball are reportedly composed of silicate-rich ordinary chondrites, whereas the telescopic spectral data of asteroid 2012 DA14 suggest a carbon-dominated composition with abundant calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions. NASA detects, tracks and characterizes asteroids and comets passing close to Earth using both ground- and space-based telescopes. The Near-Earth Object Observations Program, commonly called "Spaceguard," discovers these objects, characterizes a subset of them, and plots their orbits to determine if any could be potentially hazardous to our planet. JPL manages the Near-Earth Object Program Office for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. More information about asteroids and near-Earth objects is at: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroidwatch . More information about asteroid radar research is at: http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/ . More information about the Deep Space Network is at: http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn . Update: February 15, 2013 7pm PST New information provided by a worldwide network of sensors has allowed scientists to refine their estimates for the size of the object that entered that atmosphere and disintegrated in the skies over Chelyabinsk, Russia, at 7:20:26 p.m. PST, or 10:20:26 p.m. EST on Feb. 14 (3:20:26 UTC on Feb. 15). The estimated size of the object, prior to entering Earth's atmosphere, has been revised upward from 49 feet (15 meters) to 55 feet (17 meters), and its estimated mass has increased from 7,000 to 10,000 tons. Also, the estimate for energy released during the event has increased by 30 kilotons to nearly 500 kilotons of energy released. These new estimates were generated using new data that had been collected by five additional infrasound stations located around the world – the first recording of the event being in Alaska, over 6,500 kilometers away from Chelyabinsk. The infrasound data indicates that the event, from atmospheric entry to the meteor's airborne disintegration took 32.5 seconds. The calculations using the infrasound data were performed by Peter Brown at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. "We would expect an event of this magnitude to occur once every 100 years on average," said Paul Chodas of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. "When you have a fireball of this size we would expect a large number of meteorites to reach the surface and in this case there were probably some large ones." The trajectory of the Russia meteor was significantly different than the trajectory of the asteroid 2012 DA14, which hours later made its flyby of Earth, making it a completely unrelated object. The Russia meteor is the largest reported since 1908, when a meteor hit Tunguska, Siberia. Preliminary information indicates that a meteor in Chelyabinsk, Russia, is not related to asteroid 2012 DA14, which is flying by Earth safely today. The Russia meteor is the largest reported since 1908, when a meteor hit Tunguska, Siberia. The meteor entered the atmosphere at about 40,000 mph (18 kilometers per second). The impact time was 7:20:26 p.m. PST, or 10:20:26 p.m. EST on Feb. 14 (3:20:26 UTC on Feb. 15), and the energy released by the impact was in the hundreds of kilotons. Based on the duration of the event, it was a very shallow entry. It was larger than the meteor over Indonesia on Oct. 8, 2009. Measurements are still coming in, and a more precise measure of the energy may be available later. The size of the object before hitting the atmosphere was about 49 feet (15 meters) and had a mass of about 7,000 tons. The meteor, which was about one-third the diameter of asteroid 2012 DA14, was brighter than the sun. Its trail was visible for about 30 seconds, so it was a grazing impact through the atmosphere. It is important to note that this estimate is preliminary, and may be revised as more data is obtained. http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/asteroidflyby.html     › Back To Top Image Token:  [image-47] Image Token:  [image-62] LOADING...

ABC News Blogs > Technology > Science Science Headlines Politics Entertainment Health Lifestyle Business Technology Live Blog: Meteor Falls in Russia; Asteroid 2012 DA14 Passes   Email Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print By Ned Potter @NedPotterABC Follow on Twitter Feb 15, 2013 10:00am 7:10 p.m. ET: Final numbers may may take time, but some 1,200 people are believed injured in Russia by that object from space.  Most people probably gave the idea little thought until today.  Never before have so many people been reported injured by such an extraterrestrial visitor. Analytical Graphics, Inc., an engineering firm in Pennsylvania, has sent us animation it produced of the meteoroid’s path.  Simple, unadorned, and sobering.   5:02 p.m. ET: New information from Chelyabinsk, Russia, where the meteor that exploded in the sky today is estimated to have been about 50 feet wide and weighed 7,700 tons, entering the atmosphere at about 40,000 mph. “People started to panic. Somebody screamed ‘the end of the earth!” said one man in Russian, interviewed by a television crew. Most injuries, at least according to reports today, happened when the fragments of the meteor exploded in midair, sending shock waves through the air and shattering windows for miles around. “There was panic. People had no idea what was happening,” said Sergey Hametov, a resident of Chelyabinsk, reached by The Associated Press.  The city has a population of 1 million. “We saw a big burst of light, then went outside to see what it was and we heard a really loud, thundering sound,” he said. ABC News’ Kirit Radia, based in Moscow, reports that 20,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to the area to help residents recover. Related: ‘Playing Roulette With the Earth’: Astronaut Ed Lu on Asteroids 4:40 p.m. ET: NASA managers, at a teleconference, say the meteor that broke up over Russia had the force of a 300-kiloton bomb, and exploded 12 to 15 miles above the ground. But they had no warning, they said, because they simply don’t have the resources to look for objects that size. “Defending the Earth against tiny asteroids is not currently our goal,” said Paul Chodas, research scientist in the Near Earth Object Program Office at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.  “Even DA14 is on the small side.  Small objects are very difficult to detect, and therefore defend against.” Bill Cooke, who runs the Meteoroid Environments Office at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said some calculations have now been done for the object that broke up over Russia. He said it is probably an interloper from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, deflected our way, probably by a close pass with another object sometime in its past. “It took 2.1 years to go around the Sun once,” he said, “so it was out in the asteroid belt about a year ago.” Cooke pointed out that meteorite impacts — smaller ones — are really quite common: “The Earth intercepts 80 tons of material per day.”  Car-sized objects from space fall to Earth every month or so. An event like today’s, doing damage that people notice, happens every 50 to 100 years, said Chodas.  This was the biggest and most destructive since the Tunguska impact in Siberia in 1908. MORE: Russian Meteor Blast: More Than 1,200 Injuries 4:10 p.m. ET: Peter Diamandis is one of the founders of Planetary Resources, Inc., a start-up company with grand plans to track asteroids — and mine them for platinum, other precious metals, and the ingredients of rocket fuel. “There are platinum-rich asteroids, some of them hundreds of times richer than all the mines on Earth,” he said to me in a telephone interview.  He paints a picture of small, cheap robotic probes, waiting in orbit for an asteroid to come near enough.  They would swarm over the asteroid, scraping the good stuff from its surface for return to Earth. And by the way, he said, “It’s not our mission to be in the planetary protection business, but we’ll have the technology in orbit ready to go.”  They’d be able, he said, to give an asteroid a needed nudge if it’s headed our way. Why take these guys seriously?  Well, they have backing from Eric Schmidt and Larry Page of Google, James Cameron of “Titanic” and “Avatar” fame, and Ross Perot Jr., son of the former electronics executive turned presidential candidate. Last year when they announced their plans, ABC News asked physicist Michio Kaku what he thought of them. “I think they are part crazy and part genius,” he said. “But the bottom line is, they’re rich.” More: Meteoroids Rock! (Except When They Hit You) 3:25 p.m. ET: NASA has now posted a message saying, “The trajectory of the Russian meteor was significantly different than the trajectory of the asteroid 2012 DA14, making it a completely unrelated object.”  From the videos that came from Chelyabinsk, they say the Russian meteor “was traveling from north to south.  Asteroid 2012 DA14′s trajectory is in the opposite direction, from south to north.” Interactive: More on Asteroid Coming Close to Earth 3:18 p.m. ET: What if DA14 had actually hit us?  Astronomers say it would have had the power of a hydrogen bomb. The Tunguska impact in Siberia in 1908 was probably caused by an object of about the same mass, they say, and it flattened the tundra around for 50 miles in every direction. Asteroid 2012 DA14, seen from the Gingin Observatory in Australia. That’s why today is of interest to scientists who say we ought to be watching more actively for the junk wandering around the inner solar system. With enough advance notice, they say we can launch a simple space probe to avert danger. We asked former astronaut Ed Lu, now with the B612 foundation in California, which is trying to raise private funds for a space telescope, to scan for objects decades before they hit. If one is spotted, do we blow it up the way Bruce Willis and his crew did in “Armageddon”? Astronaut Lu says no — some sort of “space tug” to give it a gentle nudge would be less dramatic but would do the job. He said if we’re smart, we’ll have many years’ warning. In that case, the slightest diversion would be enough. “People have these crazy ideas because they get their physics from Hollywood movies,” said Lu. “Never get your physics from Hollywood movies. In general, you only need to change the velocity of an asteroid by a millimeter per second [to change its path ever so slightly]. That’s about the speed an ant crawls.”   Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck in "Armageddon."

It will continue to orbit the inner solar system, though NASA’s Near Earth Objects program says this was the closest approach to Earth that they’ve projected for it. 2:27: p.m. ET: We’re all safe here at ABC Headquarters in NYC. Safe from the asteroid, that is. There’s still that nasty flu going around. 2:25: p.m. ET: This is the moment of closest approach. Asteroid 2012 DA14 has just now come with 17,220 miles of Earth.  Looks like we’re still alive. NASA’s Near Earth Objects Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., actually was able to calculate the asteroid’s path almost a year ago – and has been reassuring people since then that there have been no major changes. Remember that Earth is a bit more than 7,900 miles in diameter, so the asteroid clearly missed by a fair amount. But when you remember that the moon is 239,000 miles away, 17,220 miles don’t feel like a lot to astronomers. 2:08 p.m. ET: Closest approach for the asteroid is 2:25 p.m. ET. Hold on to your… 1:27 p.m. ET: ABC News’ Kirit Radia, based in Moscow, passes on notes from a conversation with Paul Abell of NASA’s Orbital Debris Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston: “This was the BIGGEST meteor to hit since the 1908 impact that flattened a large part of Siberia. NASA’s preliminary calculation is that this thing weighed in at 7,700 tons (not 10 tons as Russian scientists first said). Artist’s conception of an asteroid passing Earth. “NASA’s preliminary estimate is that this item was about 15 meters in diameter (the 1908 one was 50 meters), larger than the one that streaked across the skies of California last year (though that one was probably heavier due to its composition). “The blasts we hear in the videos are NOT sonic booms caused by the meteor breaking the sound barrier. Rather it is the meteor exploding in the atmosphere. Subsequent booms are the smaller fragments breaking up. “It was the force of those explosions that blasted out the windows, again NOT sonic booms. “This thing was moving VERY fast as it entered the atmosphere…about 40,000 miles per hour.” 1:14 p.m. ET: Everyone was surprised by the Russian meteorite impact today.  Google confirms to us that it put together a playful Google Doodle for its homepage — the second letter “g” ducking to get out of the way of a passing space rock — but after the reports from Russia, they decided it would no longer be funny. “Out of respect for those injured in the extraordinary meteor shower in Russia earlier today, we have removed today’s doodle from the Google homepage,” a Google spokesperson told ABC News. “The doodle was created to mark Asteroid 2012 DA14 passing Earth.” Joanna Stern has written a post HERE. Google image 1:10 p.m. ET:A thought offered by James D. Gleason, a research scientist at the University of Michigan who mostly studies meteorites believed to have come from Mars: “While fireballs explode in Earth’s atmosphere and rain debris on the land and ocean with regularity, it is extremely rare for people to be injured in such an event,” he says in a statement from the university. It’s been pointed out that while the Earth has 7 billion people, they are clustered together — in cities, on coastlines, along rivers. Most of the Earth’s surface is open ocean, tundra, farmland, mountains, etc., which is why the injuries in Russia are so unusual. 12:57 p.m. ET: The U.S. Geological Survey reports it detected the meteor explosion near Chelyabinsk, Russia. It posted information on its earthquake hazards page. As an earthquake, it had a magnitude of … zero. Still, a lot of people reported injured as the object entered the atmosphere at supersonic speed and broke up in midair. 12:40 p.m. ET: Here’s some insight on why, after all the attention given to asteroid 2012 DA14, the Russian meteor impact was a surprise.  The answer, Gina Sunseri of our staff reports, is that we earthlings simply do not have the resources to track everything wandering our part of the solar system. She spoke with former Apollo astronaut Rusty Schweikart, who’s out to remedy that.  He’s one of the heads of the B612 Foundation, a nonprofit group trying to raise private funds to launch an asteroid-watching telescope into space.  They would call it Sentinel, and it would look for objects smaller than 2012 DA14. The bigger ones are already being found and tracked — but there are still smaller ones that could do a lot of damage, say Schweikart and his colleagues. “The truth of the matter is of all the asteroids that are out there and come near the Earth and can do harm and hit the Earth we only know one percent of them now; 99 percent of them, we don’t even know where they are,” Schweikart said. “We’ve got to find those 99 percent of asteroids that are missing, DA14 was one of those missing asteroids up until a year ago; then it was discovered by some of the guys with their telescopes in Spain, and that’s the only reason we know this one is going by. A year ago this one would have gone by and no one would ever have seen it, let alone know we could protect ourselves against it.” Related: The Search for Asteroids That Could Hit Earth 12:18 p.m. ET: NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is running video showing some images of the asteroid as they come in, mostly from Australia, where it is night. Take a look: Broadcasting live with Ustream 12:02 p.m. ET: Just spoke with Prof. Jay Melosh of Purdue University, who said he’s doubtful the Russian impact and the asteroid are related — but he’d like to know more before saying for sure. “Is there any chance they’re the same?  Probably not, but we’re not sure,” he said.  Based on the amateur video of the flying debris in Russia, it appeared to be coming from east to west — the asteroid is moving from south to north — but he’d like to look at the video more carefully. All that said, it’s quite possible that today will be a bad day for asteroid 2012 DA14.  The Earth’s gravity could force it to split in two or shed debris, most of which would follow the same path, missing us by 17,000 miles.  “It’s outside the Roche limit where objects are pulled apart, but not much.” More: Hundreds Injured as Meteor Falls in Russia 11:24 a.m ET: We’re not absolutely sure what crashed in Russia — the Russians are the ones calling it a fragmenting meteor — but most scientists say the Russian impact and the passing asteroid are not related. They’re separate pieces of space debris. Astronomers we’ve spoken with say they’re pretty sure the asteroid — called 2012 DA14 — is solid, and not shedding pieces. We are looking for info on the direction from which the objects came in Russia. Bob Berman, an astronomer who writes for Astronomy magazine and works with the space website Slooh.com, pointed out that there’s stuff hitting us all the time: “Six times per hour, there are smaller objects that enter the atmosphere and do no harm,” he said. “They’re very much like the asteroid we’re talking about, except that they’re too small for us to worry about.” Click for Pictures: Meteorite Impact in Russia Asteroid 2012 DA14. Image: ESA. 10:52 a.m. ET:The European Space Agency has posted an image of DA14 about seven hours before closest approach to Earth. The picture is a negative, so it shows the stars as black dots on a white background. The asteroid, ESA says, is the straight-line streak running across the top center of the frame. This was a three-minute exposure, and Herald’s telescope was mounted to stay locked on the stars in the background, so what we’re seeing is the asteroid moving from south to north. If it were elongated, tumbling quickly, or less than solid, the streak would vary in width over the three minutes. It’s not.

Image: from NASA/JPL. 10:00 a.m. ET:  Asteroid 2012 DA14 will miss the Earth today, scientists assure us — but it won’t miss by much.  At 2:25 p.m. ET it is expected to pass 17,220 miles from us, flying from south to north in a path that brings it closer than the geosynchronous satellites we use for communications and many weather observations. There is also word of the apparent impact of a meteor in central Russia, and we’ll be live blogging as we get more information on it as well.  We’re hoping for updates, images and commentary from NASA, independent astronomers and others. Our first information from Russia is here. Apparently as many as 1,200 people were injured, mostly by shattered glass, as an object fell from the sky over the city of Chelyabinsk, population 1.1 million.  Most of the damage, based on early reports, was not caused by the object itself but by the shockwave it created as it plowed into the atmosphere. Asteroid 2012 DA14 is larger, but if astronomers didn’t tell us about it, we would never notice it. What does it matter if a hunk of rock, about 150 feet across, goes flying harmlessly by?  The problem is that every now and then, an object from space actually hits the Earth, with devastating consequences. The most famous, 66 million years ago, was much larger than 2012 DA14 — about six miles in diameter — kicking up so much dust and ash that it is believed to have finished off the last of the great dinosaurs. There was an impact as well in 1908, striking near the Tunguska river in Siberia with the force of a two-megaton nuclear weapon.  It leveled the tundra for 50 miles in every direction. Scientists say they would rather not think about what would have happened if it had hit a city or coastline.  That is why many of them think it is worth the effort to track near-Earth asteroids so that if one is on a crash course, we can do something about it. So join us.  While scientists say they’re confident the Russian impact was unrelated to 2012 DA14, they also say the asteroid is something of a shot across our bow.  Here comes….     SHOWS: World News   Email Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
