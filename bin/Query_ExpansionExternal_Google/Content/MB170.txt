The real Mendez says the movie is mostly spot on, even if the rescue at the end wasn't quite what the film depicts. Claire Folger Movies 'Argo': A Rescue Mission With Real Hollywood Style Movies Fact Checking 'Argo': A Great Escape That Takes Some Leaps Movie Interviews Affleck On 'Argo' And The 1979 Hostage Crisis The movie Argo, up for seven Oscars at this year's Academy Awards, is based on the true story of the CIA rescue of Americans in Tehran during the 1979 hostage crisis. Missing from most of the coverage of this movie? The actual guy who ran the mission, played by Ben Affleck in the movie. Movie aficionados — and historians — know that the movie sticks pretty close to what really happened during the Iranian Revolution. In 1980, a CIA agent named Tony Mendez sneaked into Iran and spirited away six American diplomats who were hiding with Canadians. The chase scene at the end of the movie is pretty much Hollywood hype. Still, Mendez and one of the American diplomats say those hours at the airport were plenty tense. There were actually eight Americans leaving Iran that day — the six diplomats, plus Mendez and his partner, who didn't even get a mention in the movie. The Americans had been holed up at Canadian diplomats' homes for 80-odd days. That let them closely follow the chaos in the streets of Tehran — and to dwell on it. It wasn't pretty. On the day of departure, Mendez went to the airport ahead of the rest of the group to make sure everything was OK. "I signaled my partner to bring the six in, and we went through security, customs, and arrived at immigration," Mendez says. "Lee [was] a little bit ahead of us — 'cause he was the most up for it, I think." Lee is Lee Schatz, a U.S. Agriculture Department employee. His office was across the street and overlooked the embassy grounds, where he had a bird's-eye view of the violent takeover. So he knew what was at stake. But he also knew the airport well — and he didn't smoke. "There was a really long line of people waiting to check in in the smoking section, and there was no line really in the no-smoking section," Schatz says. "So rather than stay with the group, I just walked up where there was no line, got my seat assignment, and walked on through." Schatz then had to face a gauntlet of desks — check this, check that, check the health card — and then one final stop, where you handed in the yellow copy of the document you'd filled out when you'd arrived in the country. hide captionThe real Tony Mendez, shown here at the 2013 Golden Globes, recalls his dicey escape from Tehran. Kevin Winter/Getty Images Theoretically, the two parts would be matched up. But in those days there was no real way to do it on the spot — despite the way it was portrayed in the film. Everybody knew that this was the one weak point of the whole concocted story. If they tried to match up the documents and failed, they'd be caught. "I walk up, hand them this, and we know this is clearly a false document that has been prepared on our behalf," Schatz says. "I handed it to the individual, and he looked at my passport and walked into a side room. And I thought, 'Whoa. They can't actually match up these numbered pieces of paper, can they?' Seemed like forever. This guy came out stirring a cup of tea." It was actually just a tea break. The official stamped Schatz's passport and Schatz walked through to the departure lounge, trying not to breathe a sigh of relief too obviously. The others followed, but they weren't out of the woods yet. In fact, Mendez says the departure lounge was what worried headquarters the most, because that's where the Revolutionary Guard "did their business," as he put it, with passengers. "It came time to have the flight called, and when they came on the intercom, they said Swiss Air is not going to depart on time," Mendez says. "'It's got a mechanical issue.' " Now, no one panicked — but they were worried. Yes, they had backup plans, though they were pretty bad ones. And then, about an hour later, they called the flight. Mendez boarded with Bob Anders, one of the American diplomats in the group. "And as we went up the ramp to the aircraft, Bob Anders nudged me and said, 'You guys think of everything,' " Mendez says. "He pointed at the nose of the Swiss aircraft, and there, lettered across the nose, was the word Aargau — close enough to the good ship Argo. And we always look for the omen in these operations. There's some sign that tells you this is going to work. And that was the omen." Then, wheels up. No one was chasing. But the movie did get the next part right — or mostly right. Mendez says that when the plane crossed out of Iranian airspace, the Americans did break into cheers. What the movie didn't show is that lots of other passengers were cheering, not just the Americans. They didn't know what was going on, Mendez says, but they, too, were happy to be out of Tehran.

CIA agent Tony Mendez, played in the film by Ben Affleck, explains how the rescue plan was hatched. Spoiler alert: key plot details are revealed below The six Americans in hiding had escaped from the back door of the embassy as Iranian revolutionaries broke their way in, and taken refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. But they were at risk of being discovered, either by Iranian revolutionaries or the international media. Much of the world's attention was focused on the several dozen embassy staff held hostage by Iran's new revolutionary regime. Of the 66 seized, 13 had been released after a fortnight. But US President Jimmy Carter was under pressure to secure the safe return of all the hostages - including those the Iranians were unaware of. Argo is a major contender for Oscar success Tony Mendez had to find a way of smuggling the six out of the country, but first he had to get himself in without giving rise to suspicion. "We were looking for reasons for being in Tehran, but there were no good reasons," the 73-year-old former CIA chief of disguise explains. "Normally we make a cover that is very boring, very forgettable. But we couldn't go as teachers as the international schools were closed. We couldn't go as oil technicians. We couldn't go as nutritionists pretending to be inspecting crops." The Iranian hostage crisis Continue reading the main story On 1 February 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran after 14 years in exile. An Islamic Republic was declared two months later and US citizens living in the country became targets. On 4 November 1979, revolutionary students stormed the US embassy in Tehran, taking 66 hostages and demanding the return of the deposed Shah to face trial. After two weeks, Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the release of 13 female and black hostages, but the release of all remaining captives became a priority for President Jimmy Carter. On 11 April 1980, Carter approved a high-risk rescue operation, which resulted in the death of eight US personnel. After lengthy negotiations, they were finally released on 20 January 1981 - the day of Ronald Reagan's inauguration. Continue reading the main story previous slide next slide Mendez also had to consider that - unlike him - the six hostages had no training in clandestine affairs. He was in Ottawa, liaising with the Canadian government, when he decided to "reverse the rules and create a distraction". His plan was to travel to Tehran and pretend to be part of a location scouting team working on a science fiction movie. "Everyone knows that people from Hollywood go where they want to go, never mind the time in history. They forget about the fact that there is politics and danger in the world," Mendez says. Continue reading the main story “Start Quote With one of the guests I had to resort to liqueur - Cointreau - to jolly him along” End Quote Tony Mendez In January 1980, he flew to Los Angeles with $10,000 in his pocket. The CIA had a long history of working with Hollywood, especially when it came to developing disguises. He hired a script-writer, who started work immediately, and found office space for his fake production company Studio 6 - named after the six people he was planning to rescue. Within two days a script was drawn up for a new production, called Argo. The storyline was similar to the science fiction trilogy Star Wars - a big box office hit at the time - and set in an unspecified mythical place with an exotic bazaar. Studio 6 contacted magazines such as Hollywood Reporter and Variety to generate media buzz about the upcoming film. Mendez wanted it to sound as credible as possible in case the Iranian regime carried out background checks. It had taken several weeks for Mendez to convince his superiors at the CIA and members of the Canadian and American governments to approve his plan. There was concern about the unpredictable situation on the ground, and long discussions about whether the hostages should be issued fake American, Canadian or altogether different foreign passports. Continue reading the main story Find out more Tony Mendez was speaking to World Update on the BBC World Service More from World Update More from the World Service Failure would have been hugely embarrassing for the governments, and dangerous for the six hostages. "There was no plan B for the operation. Usually there is an escape plan, but there would be no car sitting outside with the engine running," says Mendez. It was a "hairy" mission, as he puts it. When he was finally ready to travel to Tehran, not even his wife Jonna Mendez, a CIA employee herself, knew what he was embarking on. President Carter had been briefed, and sent Mendez a special note: "Good luck" - though it is highly unusual for a president to be in direct contact with CIA agents, Mendez says. When he arrived, Tehran "was like a free for all", he recalls. "At night the Revolutionary Guards amused themselves by driving up and down the streets and firing machine guns at buildings. "The Revolutionaries had suspended all conventions." Being identified as a US citizen on the streets of Tehran at this time was risky. But when Mendez and his colleague Julio, a Farsi speaker, lost their way and asked a member of the Revolutionary Guard for directions to the Canadian embassy, they were lucky. He puts it down to the exotic cover story. "We were from Hollywood. We were more exciting than anybody else." On Friday, 25 January 1980, Mendez and his colleague finally met the US embassy staff at the Canadian residence in Tehran, where they had been in hiding for 86 days. Continue reading the main story More on the Argo story When Mark Lijek took Tehran as his first posting in the US foreign service, he knew he wasn't opting for an easy life. He and his wife Cora were among the six embassy staff to slip away and into hiding - some at Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor's residence, others at the home of another Canadian official, John Sheardown. "We had little to do except read books and play Scrabble. We drank quite a lot too." Of the group, he was the most immediately enthusiastic of the CIA's escape plan. "I thought it had the right amount of pizzazz. Who but film-makers would be crazy enough to come to Tehran in the middle of a revolution? I had no problem pretending to be in the movie industry." Read full article from January 2013 "They were getting worried," he says. He briefed them on the plan, and gave them Studio 6 business cards and clothes to make them look more Hollywood. The Canadian government had agreed to fake Canadian passports for the group, and Mendez had brought maple leaf badges to attach to their suitcases and bags. The next 48 hours were spent practising hostile interrogation techniques. Everyone knew the escape plan was dangerous, Mendez remembers. "The Iranians could have decided to behead us. Or we could have been dragged around with a jeep. All these things were possible," he says. To get them to relax, he tried to make a game out of the preparations. "I was hoping that [this way] they would loosen up and enjoy the operation. It may sound contrived, but you can distract people with fun much easier than with fear. With one of the guests I had to resort to liqueur - Cointreau - to jolly him along. On Monday 28 January, the group headed to Tehran airport to catch the 07:00 flight to Zurich. "There were times as we went through the checkpoints when we were not sure whether we would make it," Mendez says. He and his colleagues had decided to book Swissair, the airline he regarded to be the most efficient and reliable, and based on intelligence information about staffing at the airport, the group was booked on an early morning flight. Mendez hoped that by arriving at dawn, sleepy immigration officials and revolutionaries would be too tired to pay much attention to the group - and it worked. The plane took off, and on arrival at Zurich airport, the six Americans were escorted away by State Department officials. "There was no time for thank yous, so Julio and I went for lunch," Mendez says simply. In March 1980, after a personal meeting with President Carter in the Oval Office, the CIA presented Mendez with an award - the Intelligence Star - but as the mission was classified, he was obliged to return it immediately. Not even his family could attend the ceremony. For 17 years, the operation remained a secret, too sensitive to even be printed in the internal CIA magazine, Studies in Intelligence. In the end, it was George Tenet, director of the CIA from 1997 to 2004, who encouraged Mendez to share the story of the daring operation - and it became the inspiration for the real Hollywood movie, Argo. Ben Affleck, who directed the thriller and plays Mendez in the film, met the former CIA agent and his wife several times to consult them. "We were showing him around. Our son Toby was our driver, and we took him to the CIA and some other places where spies hang out." Two members of the Mendez family were extras, playing passengers in a car when the fictional Tony Mendez is at the airport on his way to Europe. But despite the close consultation, Affleck managed to surprise the couple when they attended the premiere of Argo with the six former hostages. "In the titles we noticed that Ben had dedicated the film to our late son Ian," Mendez says. "He used pictures of Ian in the film as well. Ben was very sensitive about it." Both Jonna and Tony say they were touched by Affleck's tribute to Ian, who died of cancer, and whom Affleck never met. "Ben is a lot more than a Hollywood guy. He is genuine and a sensitive father. It has been a joy to be associated with the film."

Biography Photos Library 1953 Coup Project Shirts Media News The Miseducation of Tony Mendez Argo Mastermind Displays Ignorance of US-Iran History Arash Norouzi The Mossadegh Project | March 31, 2013     In December 1979, six American would-be hostages in Iran managed to escape from the seized U.S. embassy, finding temporary refuge at the Tehran residences of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor and embassy immigration chief John Sheardown. Tasked with rescuing them from this predicament, CIA agent Antonio Mendez devised a wild plan to enter Iran posing as a Hollywood film crew scouting locations for a made-up science fiction film called Argo. According to Mendez, in 1997 the CIA specifically asked him to begin sharing the story of the triumphant operation (the wish of CIA director George Tenet, he was told) to help celebrate the CIAs 50th anniversary. Mendez, also honored at an agency ceremony as one of the the top CIA officers in its history, obliged. Subsequently, Mendez revealed the operation to CBS Evening News Dan Rather, and included the story in his 1999 autobiography The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA, which led to a 2007 Wired magazine article which was then optioned for the screen by George Clooney. Ben Affleck took the helm as director and star (playing Tony Mendez) in the celebrated 2012 feature film Argo, which won numerous accolades including the Oscar for Best Picture. The CIA, of course, has a notorious history in Iran, some of which is summarized in Tony Mendezs new cash-in book Argo: How the CIA and Hollywood Pulled Off the Most Audacious Rescue in History (2012). Mendez tells a highly distorted version of the events of 1953, which rely largely on the account of his predecessor at the CIA, Kermit Roosevelt, in the 1979 tell-all Countercoup: The Struggle for the Control of Iran. In fact, Mendez is so impressed with Kermit Roosevelts account, that he uses the offensive and inaccurate term countercoup four times. Mendez however fails to supply any context, other than briefly mentioning that the Shahs power was being slowly stripped away by Mossadegh, theres no description of any attempted coup to counter. Its just one of Mendezs numerous falsehoods. Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh, whom Mendez reduces to an Iranian lawyer, had aroused concern when he — recycling a standard propaganda line — aligned himself with the Tudeh Party. On the contrary, the Tudeh (Communist) party in Iran, whose pro-Soviet ideology clashed with Mossadegh's nationalist agenda, was far from a dependable source of support; if anything, they created more obstacles for the Premier. No actual evidence has been presented that Mossadegh at any point united with them — in fact Mossadegh publicly rebuked them for selling out their country. The final straw for the Eisenhower administration, Mendez informs us, came when intelligence discovered that the Soviets were about to give Mosaddeq [sic] twenty million dollars in aid. Mendezs source for this baseless claim? Eisenhower's 1963 Presidential memoir Mandate For Change. To quote the former President: And, one report said, he was looking forward to receiving $20 million from the Soviet Union, which would keep his treasury afloat for the next two or three months. This mysterious report remains unsubstantiated to this day, even after numerous CIA documents have become declassified. And each person that has ever mentioned this canard, such as the ever-unreliable CIA agent and former Iran hostage William J. Daugherty, depends entirely on this single sentence from Ikes book. Besides, Iran never received any Soviet aid under Mossadegh, not even the gold owed to her. Yet in 1954, during the U.S.-backed regime of the Shah, a curious TIME magazine article reported that the Soviet Union promised to return the eleven tons of gold they have owed the National Bank of Iran since World War II. Kermit Roosevelts handiwork, continues Mendez, which included propaganda and bought street mobs, forced [Mossadegh] to resign. Wrong again. Mossadegh never resigned, he was violently forced from power in a CIA-MI6 inspired military coup, and maintained his claim to the premiership all the way through his treason trial. I corrected the U.S. Institute of Peace for making this precise claim back in 2010, an error they subsequently retracted in response, so theres a bit of deja vu here. And like USIP, Mendez softens the coup considerably, writing that massive public demonstrations brought down Mossadegh, with no mention of the army which assailed his bullet-ridden residence. Mendez goes on to frame the 1953 countercoup in a Cold War context (he terms it the Great Game), justifying the operation as a strategic imperative in a very different world. He refers to a popular myth among Iranians that the CIA singlehandedly deposed Mossadegh, as if anybody truly believed that the coup didnt involve Iranian agents and co-conspirators. In this way, Mendez employs innuendo to imply that the 1953 coup was not quite the atrocity it's said to be. Mendezs mistakes are not confined to distant history. He recalls that on November 4, 1979, the militants had chosen to launch their attacks on National Students Day, an event commemorating the death of a group of students killed by the shahs forces during a demonstration at the University of Tehran the year before. No, it actually happened in 1953, not 1978 (during demonstrations protesting Mossadegh's removal, as Nixon visited), and the original date was December 7th, not November 4th. Ironically, the opening sequence in the Argo movie recounting the Mossadegh affair is more sympathetic (though similarly error-ridden), and Ben Affleck, who portrays Mendez, has previously touted the pro-Mossadegh narrative. Actually, Mendez and Hollywoods depiction of the Argo story apparently short-change Canada's role. President Jimmy Carter, who signed off on the operation at the time, told CNN that 90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan was Canadian, and that Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor was the main hero of the story, even though Afflecks role as Mendez, who was only in Iran for a day and half, is the chief protagonist. And so it goes. Subjective — if not deliberately deceptive — accounts from the past continue to regurgitate as historical fact. Eisenhower lied repeatedly in his book, pretending Mossadeghs overthrow was an internal uprising. Kermit Roosevelts entire book, right down to the title, was based on a lie, as were his subsequent yarns about the Shah's demise. As for Tony Mendez, there's good reason to doubt aspects of this professional con-man's self-serving account of the Argo episode. Former Ambassador Ken Taylor and Jimmy Carter severely differ with him, and his understanding of U.S.-Iran relations is underwhelming, particularly for a distinguished intelligence officer who's had over three decades to catch up on history.

Anthony Posted: 02/27/2013 9:07 am EST reddit stumble Actor Ben Affleck (R), winner of the Hollywood Ensemble Acting Award, poses with former CIA Officer Tony Mendez during the 16th Annual Hollywood Film Awards Gala presented by The Los Angeles Times held at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on October 22, 2012 in Beverly Hills, California. Get DC Newsletters: Subscribe Follow: The Oscars, Ben Affleck Argo, Tony Mendez, Tony Mendez Argo, Tony Mendez CIA, Tony Mendez Maryland, Academy Awards 2013, Argo, Argo Best Picture, Argo Cia, DC News KNOXVILLE -- After a whirlwind experience at the Academy Awards, Tony Mendez has received more than 7,000 emails about "Argo's" big win. "It changes your life," Mendez said Tuesday afternoon. Now back in Maryland, the former CIA agent and wife, Jonna, are responding to those inquiries one at a time. On Tuesday night, the couple took a break for an interview with CNN host Piers Morgan. CNN and other media outlets all seem to want a piece of Mendez and his story. "I wouldn't have thought getting an Oscar was that big of a deal, but it turns out to be a huge deal," Mendez told The Frederick News-Post. On Tuesday, Mendez described Oscar night as a surreal experience that left him in tears. He and his wife were seated inside the Dolby Theatre as first lady Michelle Obama announced "Argo" as best picture. "It was probably one of the most suspenseful things that I've done in my life ... and I've had a few," Mendez said with a chuckle. Mendez played a key role in and was the mastermind behind the plot to rescue six Americans during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81, in which dozens of Americans were held hostage for 444 days. Six of the Americans escaped from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran as it fell to hostile Iranians. They eventually ended up at the Canadian Embassy. Fearing for their lives, they hid for 86 days. Mendez, who was chief of disguise for the CIA, devised a scheme to get them out of the country by posing as a Hollywood film crew scouting locations. The unlikely cover story worked. The story is recounted in Mendez's book "The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA," published in 1999. In conjunction with the movie, Mendez has released another book, "Argo: How the CIA and Hollywood Pulled Off the Most Audacious Rescue in History," which was released in September. Now, six months later, Mendez and his wife are socializing with Hollywood celebrities. On Sunday morning, the couple had breakfast with Chris Terrio, who wrote the screenplay. "I asked him if he had written an acceptance speech, and he said "Oh, no,'" Mendez recalled of their breakfast at the Four Seasons. On Sunday night, Terrio dedicated his Oscar to Mendez. It was unexpected, as was the dedication made by director and star Ben Affleck. After the show, Mendez caught up with Affleck, who shouted, "Tonnnyyy!" and gave Mendez a hug after the show. The men spent time together before and after "Argo" reached the silver screen. "He is big and gentle," Mendez said of Affleck. "He's got two little kids to look after, and he's always worried about them and what they are doing." Affleck's wife, Jennifer Garner, is also down to earth, according to Mendez, who said, "If you talk to her, she wants to talk about the kids, then she takes off her shoes and sits on the floor." Spending time with Affleck and his wife, conducting interviews and finding time to answer email has been overwhelming at times, but Mendez is hoping people walk away with an appreciation for the film. "I think the lesson is that movies are a part of our life," Mendez said. "I want people to experience it and enjoy it." ___ (c)2013 The Frederick News-Post (Frederick, Md.)
