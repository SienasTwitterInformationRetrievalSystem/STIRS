In a segment bashing various conservatives for their views about the growing Egypt crisis, Maddow went after Sarah Palin loaded with quotes from a well-known satirical website urging the former Alaska governor to call for an invasion of the beleaguered Middle East nation (video follows with transcript and lots of commentary): RACHEL MADDOW: If you want to go even further into the deep, you are welcome to, but it may be dangerous to the health of your computer. Today, we made Kent Jones go out in a life (UNINTELLIGIBLE) to see what he could find way out there. And what he found was spectacular. It involves Sarah Palin and a Web site called "ChristWire.org." They say, quote, "The escalating crisis in Egypt could become a defining moment for Sarah Palin." "Gov. Palin needs to speak out publicly and forcibly for an American-led invasion of Egypt to protect our interest in North Africa." "As the largest recipient of foreign aid next to Israel, the U.S. has a tremendous investment in keeping Egypt stable and relatively terrorist free. Upon her direction, other western nations are sure to join us." An American-led invasion of North Africa. To be clear, this is what these folks are asking Sarah Palin to do. This is not Ms. Palin’s own idea. This is actually a moment when there is a real center in American policy. The center is a bipartisan thing, but that doesn’t mean that everybody is in the center. Problem is ChristWire.org is all a satire. Maybe someone on Maddow's crack staff could have looked at the site's hysterical mission statement for a clue: Mission Dear friends, we are living in cruel days. Evil hours. Yes, these are certainly dark times and it’s time for the moral majority to once again step forward to bring freedom and liberty to the world. Our culture was built on the guiding principles of conservatism and Christianity, from which all morality is born. As such American heritage was meant to be passed on from generation to generation, ensuring that our principles…our values…were never compromised. But alas, the Left Wing Conspiracy and Liberal Agenda is spreading like a plague not only through our fine society, but through lesser cultures as well. Their sinful antics and attempt to pass off their wanton carnal desires into mainstream culture is destroying society and mankind. That’s where we come in. Together, in this community, you and your Moral Leaders will combat the evil liberals of this world and once again ensure that a bit of freedom and righteousness once again permeates every country, and let those who don’t abide by our teachings know the eternal pit of hellfire shall be awaiting! Sincerely, Jack Gould Youth Pastor/Motivational Speaker Langley CC A little Googling might have come up with a New York Times article about the site from last September: Oh, by the way: ChristWire is all one big joke. Not the readership — which hit a high of 27 million page views in August — but the content, the opinions and the fake authors who write the stuff. (There is no “Stephenson Billings.”) Neither of the two founders is a conservative Christian. They are just like-minded 28-year-olds who met on the Internet, have never seen each other in person, and until this week had never given their real identities to a reporter. [...] A close reader of ChristWire will soon figure out (one hopes) that the site is not serious. But many of the columns are deft enough, just plausible enough, to fool the casual reader. Indeed, for Maddow is not the first liberal to fall for the satire. As the Atlantic reported last August: One of the Internet's best kept secrets is the satirical website ChristWire.org. Every day, its contributing writers publish articles condemning homosexuality, atheism, Hollywood or some other perceived threat to American culture. The writers pretend to be hard-right Christian conservatives and, occasionally, they succeed in tricking serious news organizations into believing them. Last month, for instance, we caught NBC Los Angeles falling for a ChristWire article about the moral depravity of Bill Murray. The article called Murray a "murderer of lambs" and a "fatal disease" to society. Still, the satire was lost on NBC (they interpreted it as unchecked Christian fundamentalism and later had to issue a correction). Today, ChristWire claimed more scalps with an article titled Is My Husband Gay? It ominously warns that "homosexuality can pop up at any time" and that "over 2 million couples" are secretly struggling with homosexuality in their marriages. Faux-pundit Stephenson Billings goes on to advise married women on how to tell if their husband is gay. [...] Thus far, they've snookered the The Huffington Post and a number of smaller left-leaning websites. HuffPo's Katla McGlynn denounced it for relying on "unfounded and offensive stereotypes about gay men." Though the article is patently ridiculous, McGlynn goes line by line lambasting it. On Tuesday, the Atlantic noticed Maddow's misstep as well as her program's acknowledgement of the error: Now to Maddow's credit, her blog acknowledged the mistake quickly after the broadcast aired. Last night, the Maddow Blog tweeted: Yes, someone from her organization admitted the blunder on Twitter, and we imagine Maddow will do that herself this evening. But there's a larger issue here. As NewsBusters has demonstrated for years, the journalistic standards at MSNBC are severely lacking. In this Internet Age, it is amazingly easy to identify the integrity of sources. With all the information available out there concerning ChristWire, it's deplorable that no one at MSNBC determined its satirical nature before this piece about Palin was cited. Taking the joke even further, CW informed its readers Tuesday of the significance of Maddow's gaffe in a piece entitled "What the Liberal Media Can Learn From Rachel Maddow’s Christwire Scandal": MSNBC talking head Rachel Maddow lit up the conservative blogosphere Monday night with an unprecedented attack on Christian journalism in America today. In the middle of a discussion about the Egyptian crisis, she shocked many with a surprisingly vicious assault on Sarah Palin and her grassroots supporters across the country. It was the height of unabashed media bigotry and this liberal icon’s career may very well suffer from the repercussions already stirring around the globe. Yet Maddow, like so many of her liberal ilk, is so obsessed with the rise of the Tea Party that she fails to appreciate dangers beyond her elitist, navel-gazing circle of self-aggrandizing wantons. The idea that a national movement could be birthed on our factory floors, nurtured in our churches and catapulted to media prominence through town hall protests simply terrifies the subversive elements in the United States today. Most agree that in a time of war it is essential that this nation present a united front against our enemies. Sadly, Maddow conveniently sidelines this fact. Instead, she sees the tide of Egyptian violence as the perfect excuse to exact revenge on a beloved figure who enjoys tremendous support on the home front. [...] It is easy to dismiss this newswoman as a second-rate disingenuous fringe zealot who would trade her cable news podium to fill in Mary Hart’s heels on Entertainment Tonight in a heartbeat. [...] She is like a schmaltzy Catskills comedian, desperate for a few claps of pitying applause as we anxiously make our way to the bar. At the end of the night, we must acknowledge that she’s just as responsible for the flaccid tuna casserole of bad ideas as her bosses in the Obama administration who serve up the steaming plates of Biden talking points, bastardized health studies and blog posts from the perpetually unemployed. Liberals gorge themselves on this overpriced buffet meal with reckless abandon, blind to the fact that they’re genuinely putting the future of America at risk. Although the "so-called" author was joshing with his attacks, Maddow and her adoring fans should heed the truth buried amidst the satire.

This episode shows the eagerness and desperation to bash; they can't be bothered doing even the most perfunctory fact-checking.

Ultimately she wants to teach college/university English, and no, she is not a liberal...Quite the contrary, she is one of the few, it seems, of her generation that is a conservative.

PS, I got me one of them there, too.  I love his stories of the idiocy of the liberal college instructors he's had in the last few years.  I did warn him to hide his beliefs when necessary to succeed in class.  At least here in the Midwest, he had a surprising number of conservative instructors as well.  I think certain sensibilities rub off the further you get from the coasts.   "An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last."  - Sir Winston Churchill Login to post comments Hunter...Same here...We're in... Submitted by PrairieSky on Tue, 02/01/2011 - 5:26pm. North Dakota, and as conservative a state as this is, even we have our share of libnut professors here. Fortunately, our daughter has had far more really good professors than loons, but even one loon is too much. One in particular, who was filling in for another professor who was taking a sabbatical, was so looney and off the rails politically (and every other way), that the university ended up firing him mid-term, after his students essentially revolted against him because of his behavior and what he was saying in class. Our daughter too has felt the need to be somewhat low key about her political beliefs, in order to avoid conflicts...Not so much with her professors, but with other students. As is true with most of her generation, many if not most of her fellow students lean left, some of them very left. She has always stood her ground though, and more than once has, along with other right leaning students, revealed how cockeyed the thinking and reasoning is of one of the liberal students. And I agree that the liberal craziness does seem to be more endemic in the larger schools in the country and on the coasts. "Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction...It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them (our children) to do the same." ~President Ronald Reagan  Login to post comments Quoting Submitted by Hunter12 on Tue, 02/01/2011 - 8:33pm. Quoting Churchill: “If you're not a liberal at twenty you have no heart, if you're not a conservative at forty you have no brain.” Gifted children mature at a faster rate than others of their generation.   "An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last."  - Sir Winston Churchill Login to post comments Dan Rather is Submitted by okiehawk44 on Tue, 02/01/2011 - 2:53pm.

On Tuesday, proving once again that it takes a lot of rationalizations to be a liberal these days, Maddow blamed her mistake on Fox News's Glenn Beck and other prominent conservatives (video follows with partial transcript and commentary): In a lengthy segment which began with Maddow bashing conservatives such as House Speaker John Boehner (R-Oh.), former President George W. Bush, and former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, the MSNBCer went after this evening’s real object of disaffection: RACHEL MADDOW: For some folks, opportunity is always, opportunity is always knocking when it comes to their chosen policies. But for some folks, opportunism is not about pushing for a specific policy. It's about choosing every occasion as the right occasion to push for their favorite idea, for their favorite story. Like for example the idea, the story, that it's the end of the world. Maddow then played a clip from Monday’s “Glenn Beck” show wherein he spoke about what’s going on in Egypt as being “the coming insurrection.” After its conclusion, she commented: MADDOW: As opposed to the other times the coming insurrection was upon us, now, the people protesting against Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, now that means that the coming is upon us because China is going to take over New Zealand. Also, the Muslim world is one country now. More of Monday’s “Beck” was aired, followed by additional comments from Maddow: MADDOW: Mr. Beck and for others who see a direct ratio between their own success and how afraid they can make their audiences, it turns out that an uprising in Egypt is even better evidence of this being the end of the world than say the last evidence we had, which was President Obama passing Wall Street reform last July. Yet another “Beck” clip was aired, this one a rant against, as Maddow said, FinReg, followed by more commentary by the MSNBCer: MADDOW: “Wall Street reform. Your republic is over!” The mainstream Right and Republican Congressional leaders are generally sort of supporting what the Obama administration is doing right now in regard to Egypt and diplomacy. They are being relatively cautious and diplomatic. But to the right of them, within a span of one week, it went from protests on the streets of Egypt to China is going to take over New Zealand. It went from protests on the streets of Egypt to Barack Obama supports the secret annihilation of Israel and so do you. It went from protests on the streets of Egypt to this was all some secret plot hatched by unions. After more than six minutes of conservative/Beck bashing, Maddow finally addressed her pathetic gaffe from the previous evening: MADDOW: And if you are wondering, yes, this is all an elaborate excuse slash explanation for us believing that ChristWire.org was something other than satire yesterday. The clip of her gaffe from Monday was shown followed by: MADDOW: Yes, those folks asking [Sarah Palin] to invade North Africa it turns out are writers for a satirical website called ChristWire.org, which is really actually very excellent. Props to them for a brilliant piece of satire, shame on us for believing it, but in a world where China taking over New Zealand is what passes for real analysis on the situation in Egypt, how do we know that's not satire, too? This was followed by a clip of Beck saying, “This is the coming insurrection. This is what I have been warning about.” And that was Maddow’s explanation for getting duped by a satirical website: in her view, conservatives – especially Glenn Beck – are saying all kinds of crazy things. As a result, it’s become difficult for her to know what’s real and what’s a spoof. If this is the case, then maybe she should stop reporting on what conservatives are saying. If she can no longer discern between fact and fiction, serious commentary and satire, she can’t possibly be trusted or taken seriously about anything, for who knows what her next source will be and whether or not it’s actually legitimate. Maybe more importantly, how can anyone on television – Rhodes scholar or not! – be deserving of the public’s trust if she blames her own mistakes on others not at all involved in her program? Sadly, this is par for the course on MSNBC as well as other liberal media outlets. These are the same people that disgustingly blamed conservatives for the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) last month. They’re used to pointing fingers at others without merit. Nice job, Rach. I knew you'd address your gaffe, but had no idea you'd blame other people for it. About the AuthorNoel Sheppard is the Associate Editor of NewsBusters.

The MSNBC host's explanation was a lesson in deflection to avoid direct responsibility for ones fuax pas. You are right to question, in the future, the MSNBC hosts ability to be taken seriously not for making a mistake, but the inabilty to tell the direct truth and except responsibility. Most people are understanding when mistakes happen, but a Rhodes scholar to blame political and professional opponents for a mistake of this gravity brings to mind the famous quote by Flip Wilson, "the devil made me do it." seems rather base and shallow and frankly dishonest.

Login to post comments Just Earning Her Combat Pay Submitted by Boil It Down on Wed, 02/02/2011 - 4:12am. Rachael Maddow is doing the exact job for which she was hired. It is no understatement to say that she is mandated by her superiors to oppose, by whatever means, FOX news. This being the first order of business, rather than honest and forthright reporting, causes the people at MSNBC to make these sort of missteps. If you are too eager to get out there with an attack, you bite on anything so juicy as this fake story and forget to corroborate the facts. The attack is just too vital a part of their operation. I imagine that a low budget for their research department due to low ratings may be a contributing factor as well.  It's not as though I expect Maddow to be an investigative reporter, I know that is not her role. However, those supposed journalists across the MSM who engage in this zeal for villification are no better than all the attack dogs at MSNBC and that needs to be pointed out to the public.

"Liberals" are a Master Race of superiorly intelligent National Socialists.  All of their ideas and policies are of the UTMOST racial purity.  Anyone who disagrees with them is obviously, greedy sub-human degenerate racist scum. Consequently, NOTHING is EVER a "liberal"'s fault...It may be Glenn Beck's fault, maybe Rush Limbaugh.  Maybe Bush, Cheney, or Republicans in general.  We just need to thank God they haven't devolved to the point where they start blaming everything on the Jews, though, of course, for them, in the Middle East, it's all Israel's fault. We should pray not only for the mad lesbian, but all "liberals" In the meantime, beware the Left Wing motto:  Do NOT tolerate dissent, National (or International) Socialism, Ueber Alles! Login to post comments How did she blame Beck? Submitted by goldwaterfan on Wed, 02/02/2011 - 4:42am. At the end, she blamed herself and her staff for failing to distinguish between conservative opinion and satire of conservative opinion. The point was that Glenn Beck has said so many off the chart crazy things the last couple of days, so an off the chart crazy thing posted by someone else might seem plausible. She was wrong, and admitted it. Give her some credit for admitting her mistake.   Amanda Carrington Login to post comments Goldwater, we will agree that Submitted by PeskyDane on Wed, 02/02/2011 - 7:28am. Goldwater, we will agree that Beck does indeed go off the rails.  But her "point" was head-shakingly stupid, and her long-winded excuse that of a child.  Not impressed by Oxford if she is representative of the final product.

We should give her credit for admitting her mistake, she didn't know Christwire was satirize site. Golly, even though just a couple months ago she, Olbermann and NBC all fell for another Christwire hoax about Boycotting of Bill Murray! Who did she blame that one on? She fell for the “Africa” hoax AP: "MSNBC was the victim of a hoax when it reported that an adviser to John McCain had identified himself as the source of an embarrassing story about Palin. "David Shuster, an anchor for the cable news network, said on air Monday that Martin Eisenstadt, a McCain policy adviser, had come forth and identified himself as the source of a Fox News Channel story saying Palin had mistakenly believed Africa was a country instead of a continent. Eisenstadt identifies himself on a blog as a senior fellow at the Harding Institute for Freedom and Democracy. "Yet neither he nor the institute exist; See a pattern here? They all involve Palin. They all are obvious hoaxes. All of the hoaxers were known, documented hoaxers. She failed to do the basics and verify the story before going to air with it.

No one forces liberals to believe what they do.  The fact they can be duped is because of their rabid belief that they are right and everyone else is, not just wrong, but evil too.  The fact that MSNBC chooses to have a whole crew of people like that is surprising, being they would liked to be considered a news organization, but they've made their choices and Maddow is one of them. Just once, I would like to see a liberal show that actually chooses to discuss the issues, on their merits, and not try to make the people that disagree with them out to be evil.  The White House didn't want to discuss the Florida ruling on it's merits, it wanted to attack the Judge, call him outside the mainstream, and leave it at that.  It must be a liberal disease.

A liberal show that discusses the issues on their merits, calling in experts from both sides, using real financial numbers and accurate economic predictions to project the outcome of actions and real world effects of the liberal, progressive agenda?  That would last one episode and end with the liberal hosts and experts either slitting their wrists or converting to conservatism.  I haven't had a decent argument or debate on any major issue with a liberal in years that haven't led to either a concession to my point or an attack on my personality.  Let's face it, the liberal agenda isn't about the truth, it's a consolidation and perpetuation of power.   "An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last."  - Sir Winston Churchill Login to post comments when one opens mouth- Submitted by JIMMY1660 on Wed, 02/02/2011 - 10:23am. be sure what comes out is true and factual. plenty of opportunities to point them out. the conservatives makes thoughtless statements. repeat behavior on her part-tells us all she is agenda driven.

Blaming everyone and everything else except where accountbaility is due, while deriding the act of self defense itself and going so far as criminalizing preparation to do so, is the mainstay of libralism today. Liberals so want to be the authority to assign blame, but they come to a stonewall when faced with the fact it is they themselves, their own policy and political positions, are to blame. Rachel, you got it wrong because you report as you wish it to be rather than how it is. The solution is easy, stop trying to make the news and instead just admit what it is.

Liberals are always blathering that conservatives are anti-intellectual or uninformed.  Looks like Rache got so caught up in the liberal groupthink lie that she has to blame being "duped" for her own gullibility.  Not this time, Rache.  You fell for satire and you drooling, half-baked audience of mindless liberal minions bought into it because you mentioned it.  So much for the value of your doctoral degree teaching critical analysis, Rache. Login to post comments Does anyone else notice Submitted by American Infidel on Thu, 02/03/2011 - 8:09pm. that msnbc uses more time in Fox clips than they use themselves? I've never seen anyone on Fox using clips of msnbc. We've finally given liberals a war against fundamentalism, and they don't want to fight it. They would, except it would put them on the same side as the United States.

Topics Politics Business Technology Entertainment National Global Culture Departments The Smart Set Today's Best Call Sheet Media Diet All Authors Feb 1, 2011 9:38AM ET / Entertainment Rachel Maddow and NBC Struggle With Satire John Hudson 88 Share Email Comment   4,838 views Presented by Update: See below The Internet's finest satirists hooked a big fish in the media world last night. In an embarrassing segment on her MSNBC show, Rachel Maddow slammed conservatives for attacking President Obama's Egypt policies. Her targets included Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, former ambassador to the UN John Bolton and Stephenson Billings at ChristWire.org. Only problem is Stephenson Billings is not a real person. He's a fictional byproduct of a website that also warns readers that the Xbox Kinect is a terrorist training tool and the Japanese have created scary robot babies which "threaten humanity." The article that caught Maddow's eye called for an "American-led invasion" into Egypt and begged former Alaska governor Sarah Palin to lead the war cry. "The escalating crisis in Egypt could become a defining moment for Sarah Palin," Billings wrote. "Governor Palin needs to speak out publicly and forcibly for an American-led invasion to protect our interests in North Africa." In the following clip (which MSNBC scrubbed from its website) Maddow falls for the article hook, line and sinker: The fact that ChristWire isn't a sincere Christian web forum has been a difficult lesson for the mainstream media to learn—especially NBC and its affiliates. The Atlantic Wire first outed ChristWire last July, when NBC's New York and Los Angeles affiliates published an article about the Christian right boycotting actor Bill Murray. NBC's Drew Magary linked to a ChristWire article calling Murray a "murderer of lambs" and a "fatal disease" to America's children. The article's author? Stephenson Billings. Maybe the company should flag this guy in its employee handbook. Now to Maddow's credit, her blog acknowledged the mistake quickly after the broadcast aired. Last night, the Maddow Blog tweeted: The bad news about a free and open internet? Sometimes you get had by brilliant satirists. Christwire: 1 TRMS: 0less than a minute ago via webMaddow Blog MaddowBlog Maddow's humility sparkles in comparison to The Huffington Post's, which upon being duped by ChristWire last August, simply erased parts of the article that showed they weren't in on the joke. In that instance, ChristWire had published an advice guide for women on how to tell if their husbands are gay. The mistake caught the attention of The New York Times which pressed the website on the issue and finally elicited a concession. “ We did get hoodwinked,” Huffington Post spokesperson Mario Ruiz admitted. C'mon people. Google searches! They're not that hard. Update: Business Insider reports that Maddow will "address" the ChristWire blunder tonight on her show. Tune in!

In the middle of a discussion about the Egyptian crisis, she shocked many with a surprisingly vicious assault on Sarah Palin and her grassroots supporters across the country. It was the height of unabashed media bigotry and this liberal icon’s career may very well suffer from the repercussions already stirring around the globe. At the heart of Ms. Maddow’s tirade was a simplistic and mocking attempt to understand an investigative article by this reporter entitled, “As Egypt Descends in Chaos, Should Sarah Palin Support a US-Led Invasion?” In that piece, the growing consensus that the insurgencies in North Africa presage a rise in Islamic fundamentalism was detailed. This is an issue that politicians like Governor Palin desperately need to address. We may very well be facing the gravest security threat to American primacy since September 11th. httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwK35y4kr_E Yet Maddow, like so many of her liberal ilk, is so obsessed with the rise of the Tea Party that she fails to appreciate dangers beyond her elitist, navel-gazing circle of self-aggrandizing wantons. The idea that a national movement could be birthed on our factory floors, nurtured in our churches and catapulted to media prominence through town hall protests simply terrifies the subversive elements in the United States today. Most agree that in a time of war it is essential that this nation present a united front against our enemies. Sadly, Maddow conveniently sidelines this fact. Instead, she sees the tide of Egyptian violence as the perfect excuse to exact revenge on a beloved figure who enjoys tremendous support on the home front. Several of my fellow journalists have suggested to me privately that, at the very least, Maddow owes Christwire an apology. Frankly, I’d rather not lower myself to her level. Most conservatives do not even consider her worthy of consideration. Her self-serving browbeating of a hardcore socialist agenda is an anathema to faith and righteousness. It is easy to dismiss this newswoman as a second-rate disingenuous fringe zealot who would trade her cable news podium to fill in Mary Hart’s heels on Entertainment Tonight in a heartbeat. Yet maybe this is the perfect opportunity to finally reassess one of this country’s most notorious persecutors of our sacred freedoms. The fact is Maddow has done incalculable harm to the America we know and love. She smirks and guffaws her way through every newscast with an ersatz humility. She is like a schmaltzy Catskills comedian, desperate for a few claps of pitying applause as we anxiously make our way to the bar. At the end of the night, we must acknowledge that she’s just as responsible for the flaccid tuna casserole of bad ideas as her bosses in the Obama administration who serve up the steaming plates of Biden talking points, bastardized health studies and blog posts from the perpetually unemployed. Liberals gorge themselves on this overpriced buffet meal with reckless abandon, blind to the fact that they’re genuinely putting the future of America at risk. Ms. Maddow’s outrage, delivered with shrill emotionalism, is simply unconvincing. It’s as if she knows deep in her heart that she will never command the respect of her Fox News betters. As an intellectual, she is only slightly capable of reading the pithy lines fed to her from a teleprompter. One sees her eyes darting back and forth as she stumbles her way through complex sentences. Awkward pauses warn us of the arrival of a multisyllabic word. Despite the fact that she is hopelessly out of her league on prime time television, she makes no effort to hide her seething grandiosity. The divergent sexuality that Maddow so willfully exudes with her tight jackets and bee-stung lips is off-putting, if not patently offensive. But somehow she still cultivates an audience. By endorsing radical lifestyle choices and free health care, she beckons many into her chasms of unfathomable sensuality. Like a true liberal, she never divulges the intense same-sex crisis that taunts her at every turn. What is most maddening is that many women in America have been drawn into her dangerous web, tempted to experiment with fleshy interactions that serve no procreative role. Can she honestly say that this is the patriotic thing to do at a time when surging third world populations are tearing down our borders, ready to throw our freedoms onto the floor for swarthy violations of sin and socialism? Yes, it’s high time that all of us admit that Rachel Maddow embodies every possible scenario of our downfall as a nation. I do appreciate that Ms. Maddow described my journalism as “spectacular” on her broadcast. Maybe there is some hope in that outrageous brain of hers. While some of my enemies on the left are warning fellow reporters to avoid my work, with John Hudson of the Atlantic even going so far as to say of NBC, “Maybe the company should flag this guy in their employee handbook,” I have a humble suggestion. Why not follow up with a look at some groundbreaking investigations I have performed on Bill Murray, The Golden Girls and homosexual pets? As Maddow dejectedly tweeted after her encounter with the cerebral superiority of this website’s message, “Christwire: 1, The Rachel Maddow Show: 0.” Yes indeed, Rachel. Yes indeed. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwK35y4kr_E Thanks for rating this! Now tell the world how you feel through social media. Share this on Twitter and on Facebook.

I hate sounding like a broken LP, but the truth needs to be promulgated to the naysayers and boo birds that scoff at your revelatory articles. They need to be brought back to Eden. As noted on another thread, this woman has openly admitted to being a vampire. While a member of the amoral undead, Ms. Maddow does provide video proof of this claim. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hxbtrckfo4 It is so sad that so many listen to this woman and are blind to the truth.

Praise or Condemn: 13  8 Matt View February 1, 2011 To imply that Palin is universally loved on the home front and that there should be an invasion of Egypt because the people there are seeking democratic reforms, is insane. We should be supporting the downfall of dictators while keeping a close watch on the situation to guard against an Islamic takeover of the region. The problems in Egypt could turn out to be a benefit for the region if they end up with free and open democratic state with an equally open economy. Now is not the time to be reactionary or start ideological fights with people you disagree with. It is also far from the time to take military action that will put our servicemen in harms way before we have a clearer understanding of the situation at hand and the direction that the country is going. Praise or Condemn: 15  9 MeAwesome replied: View February 1, 2011 I appreciate your call for restraint. However people are dying there, today. People are running out of food, today. People yearn for freedom, today. The people of Egypt are as we speak begging for us to come free them. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9xTFrDq1t0 And I quote from an Egyptian protester ‘Why isn’t the U.S. helping? An Egyptian fellow I know watched the Rachel Maddow show on the internets last night and was horrified that Rachel Maddow immediately dismissed their calls for help. We as American’s can’t call ourselves “the land of the free and the home of the brave” unless we are willing to help others be free and brave. After all our honorable Marine Hymn contains the phrase “…..to the shores of Tripoli” telling me they are always ready to go to north Africa.

Like we are all supposed to fold our hands in our lap and sit quietly? These progressives want to use the macro view of “we are the world” when it suits them. Then tell those they disagree with to “mind their own tribe” when it comes to our Christian brothers and sisters in crisis. Calling ChristWire posters “reactionary”? I guess that is code for someone that disagrees with the liberal mindset.

That seems absurd, and truly dangerous. “With the knowledge that I have of the great revolutionary and history making people of Egypt, I am sure they will play their role in creating an Islamic Middle East for all freedom, justice and independence seekers,” Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi was quoted as saying on state television’s website.” “The people of Tunisia and Egypt prove that the time of controlling regimes by world arrogance (the West) has ended and people are trying to have their own self-determination,” said Salehi, who also currently oversees Iran’s controversial nuclear programme.” Egypt revolt is ‘step towards Islamic Middle East’ http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=258493 Praise or Condemn: 8  2 loki replied: View February 2, 2011 “One has to remark that men ought to be either well treated or crushed . . .” –Machiavelli At the heart of this whole issue is the fact that our system needs poverty and creates poverty through policy and crisis and at the same time is directly and indirectly threatened by the poor. The system is dependent on surplus populations in order to create redundant labor that keeps wages and services low while keeping profits high. However these surplus populations are at the same time a threat to political, aesthetic and cultural paradigm. The US incarcerates these populations! Mubarak’s CIA handler must have messed up the lesson plan because he obviously didn’t get that memo. Egypt’s surplus population has become exploding political dynamite and the dominant system of elitist Middle Eastern dictators and their Western collaborators are reeling. Obama’s puppet masters know full well that the people in a real democratic and popular government –in Egypt or any other country- would never accept their place as pawns in the elite class’ system of inequality. This is the real reason why Obama and the rest of the mean-spirited, power hunger, oppressive bastards that run our country and most of rest of the world can’t accept the uprisings in Egypt. Power to the people! Praise or Condemn: 4  1 Stephenson Billings replied: View February 2, 2011 Thanks for the analysis, Trotsky. First of all, I take exception to your use of the term “excess populations.” It’s this type of talk that leads to condoms and abortions. Furthermore, you seem to think America’s investment in Muburak was failed, but you disregard the fact that it actually went along swimmingly for 30 years. 30 years! That’s an above average run for a dictator and we surely got our every penny’s worth. The man is 82 now and when they get that old, they lose their fight. It’s only to be expected. As for your claim that the powers that be cannot accept the populist uprising in Egypt because it poses a threat to American economic and social security, well that was exactly the point of my previous article. So maybe we do agree! Stop the violence, send in the troops! Praise or Condemn: 4  4 Claire replied: View February 2, 2011 “It’s this type of talk that leads to condoms and abortions.” You can’t be against both of those. Condoms prevent abortions. So which would you rather have – condoms or abortions? Praise or Condemn: 8  4 MeAwesome replied: View February 2, 2011 It’s pretty clear that every Christian sperm or egg that does not conceive is a waste of God’s creation. This is further proof why unnatural sex acts like oral and anal are unholy. Praise or Condemn: 4  8 RD replied: View February 2, 2011 How is it “clear”? Please, elaborate, if you would. Although, since you did specify that it’s only the waste of Christian sperm and eggs that makes your god unhappy, I guess that means anyone who ISN’T a Christian gets a free ticket. Joy. Praise or Condemn: 5  3 MeAwesome replied: View February 2, 2011 God told his people, “Go forth and multiply”. I am not sure about whether non-believers should multiply.

People are getting smarter about that sort of thing and NOT just taking out loans to buy houses that they can’t afford down the line. As for the jobs, it’s mainly due to the fact that companies just aren’t making any real money, meaning they can’t hire people, and thus the cycle continues, and when you add in how companies are also outsourcing their work, it does nothing but pile on more problems (and THIS is a problem that’s been around for a while now, INCLUDING when Bush was in office, so don’t pin this on Obama). //Yes, we have IPads and IPhones and Facebook, but that’s not the sort of social improvement that nurtures the soul.// Again, it’s thanks to technology that you’re able to be alive, and if you get cancer, it’s thanks to technology that will either slow it down, stop it, or even remove it.

The thesis of this article is not whether a scandal is justified, but what have you learned from it.

Yesterday I was a liberal & an atheist, but not today. I want to warn you of something: just before I swore off The Daily Show, I heard Jon imply that Half-Gov. Palin might be a Communist plant. He was very convincing in that she wears red all the time & talks about ‘bears’. She also says ‘freedoms’ a lot & that is almost Russian. The Founding Fathers preferred ‘liberties’ which, though close to the word ‘liberal’, is just old fashioned talk for ‘American’. Respectfully yours now. Praise or Condemn: 3  1 MeAwesome replied: View February 1, 2011 Barbsy, Welcome to the fellowship. I too found this internets site fairly recently, though it was from a recommendation from our pastor at the Free Evangelical Church of Idaho. A while ago many of us that follow this site also questioned whether people from Alaska were truly Americans. Some of us thought they were still Russia planning to subvert America. Some people thought they had earned the right to call themselves Americans through their voting records. We did not reach a consensus. However we all agreed Sarah Palin was a turning point for Alaskan acceptance. After all a good portion of the southwest was Mexican too.

I’m losing sleep over this. That Maddow character is all embroiled in research & such, whatever that means.

You guys make a bit of sense but twist this into a religious cause instead of something more logical. It is true that Islamic radicals could take over the Egyption government. It could also cause unstable action to occur in the middle east. None of this should be a holy war as you guys imply but a logical terrorist actions to another country like Israel. I am not saying this because Israel is an ally but as a possible boiling point in that region.

I want to tell you that I am a Christian and you are certainly out of touch with our world. You say that I do not represent Christianity, you say that I am outside of the mainstream, you label me a radical, but are you truly so blind to the passion of Evangelicals in America today? I’m not alone, in fact I’m part of a very large community that people like you pretend do not exist. My journalism follows closely the work of Dr James Dobson who created one of the most successful faith-based organizations in this country, helping families deal with the crises of pornography, sexuality and drug addiction. Have you never heard of Focus on the Family? My reading of the Bible and my dedication to Christ’s Words are wholly in line with what Evangelicals are preaching all across this great country. I fight against the “deviancy cabal” drawing directly on the Biblical teachings of renowned scholars like the Reverends Bryan Fischer, Lou Engle, Rick Joyner, Estus Pirkle and Joel Osteen to name but a few. I also am a fervent supporter of the Reverend Dr. Pat Robertson who has literally touched tens of millions with his 700 Club ministry and Liberty University. My beliefs rarely stray from Pat’s guiding light. When it comes to radical feminism, there is Constitutional attorney Phyllis Schlafly who has wrestled against it for decades. She is known the world over for her advocacy and love of Jesus. You think I imagine the discrimination and bigotry our faith faces every day? Read the journalism of David Limbaugh (brother of Rush). When it comes to politics, you seem equally out of touch. It’s people like you who fail to understand why those of us in the Tea Party are so engaged. We love this country, we want to do everything we can to save it. Honor, integrity and the Constitution are vital to us. I will not abandon that and looking around at the town hall meetings, the protest marches, the rise of our candidates, we are making an impression. We are an integral part of the United States and if you’re so conceited that you can’t be bothered to recognize the revolution happening before your very eyes, I really don’t know what to say. You try to malign me, cast me aside but you fail to see I am simply a man who is but one of you. I’m dedicated and I’m honest.
