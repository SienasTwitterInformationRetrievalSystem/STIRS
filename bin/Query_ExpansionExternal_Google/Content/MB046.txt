There were bold, color-blocked coats and solid silk shifts in vivid primary hues. Even the more fitted sleeveless sheaths in Prince of Wales check were handpainted with subtle washes of color. Cut and construction remain the designer's obsessions. A simple coat, for example, was patchworked together from at least three different fabrics; it almost looked like it had been turned inside out, as if Maier wanted the world to see its meticulous inner workings. If that sounds like a tough sell with some Bottega customers, the latest innovations to the intrecciato bags won't be: Now they're woven with extra fringes of leather. The patent d'Orsay ballet flats Maier showed with everything—short and long, day and night—are no technological feat, but they're worth a mention, as they make a pretty persuasive argument to ditch heels for good.

Over the past few years its creative director, Tomas Maier, has developed an interiors collection that includes furniture, textiles, crystalware and more. Shown here is its porcelain tableware range, made in collaboration with the renowned German manufacturer KPM, and decorated with the interwoven 'intrecciato’ motif that is used on many of Bottega Veneta’s leather goods.

The company was formed in 1966, but since (2001) has been bought out by Gucci group. Bottega Veneta is a Italian made luxury brand, with no known outsourcing done in China. Below is an image of a real Bottega Veneta made in Italy stamp: Also notice the shape of the O in Bottega. This detail can vary, and we will address this point further (below). Bottega Fonts: Bottega Venenta has a distinct font, however it generally does not have any unusual letter tweaks that would be singular to Bottega. (see our fake Jimmy Choo guide for example of brand specific details.) That being said, there does appear to be a slight brand specific [variance detail] with some of the fonts, namely concerning the letter O. What Bottega has done with the O is give the illusion of a slightly tilted letter O, as if it were tapped to the side and was tilting left. This effect is done by the dark shading within the letter O. But this is not the case with every Bottega O. So always be aware of these differneces. If a handbag of the same model/style etc, has the round O, and the same model/style etc on another bag has the tilted O, then that should raise a red flag. Spaced font rounded(O): In the image (left) of the real Bottga Veneta font etched in metal, you can see that the O is round, and not the oval shape as seen (above). The one difference however, concerns the spacing of the letters. In the example below, the letters embossed into the leather are closer together, but in the font example (left), the letters are spaced farther apart. These examples should give you an idea of what to expect with Bottega fonts, and also to remind you that there are some differences in certain fonts they use. Real font: The (left) is an image of an authentic Bottega font. Notice that the O in the Bottega font is perfectly rounded like the font (above), and unlike the font (two above) where the O has a more oval shape. This is the more common style when Bottega embosses leather. But a rounded O font is also used in etching metal (as seen above) with the brand and logo. Also, some of the logos [fonts] stamped into a leather backing frame that has two rivets at each end will oftem times place the rivet partially over letter B. An example of this is (below). Fake Label: In the fake example (left), there are two things that should be noticed. First the overall quality of the stamp impression is poor. When compared to the earlier example of the same logo stamped onto black leather, the differences are obvious. The fake on the left is blurry and sloppy. The letters are unclear and they tend to blend into each other, the leather is tugging at the stamps, due to weak pressure of the embossing machine. And also notice the gold hardware clamps, the left clamp should be covering more of the letter B in Bottega, as shown below. Real label with clamps: The authentic label on the left shows the left clamp to be covering part of the letter B. This is a detail that is common with Bottega. It does not mean that fake Bottega Veneta handbags will not have this feature, as many will mirror this detail, but it is one that gets overlooked at times by the counterfeiters. Also notice the clear stamp impression from the quality embossing done by Bottega Veneta. The letters are all clear and crisp in the leather. [ebay] Bottega Veneta under $100 Bottega Veneta $101-500 Bottega Veneta $501-1000 Bottega Veneta $1001-1500 Bottega Veneta $1501-2000 Bottega Veneta $2001-2500 Bottega Veneta $2501-5000 Bottega Veneta $5001-50,000 Shapes: One of the problems that many counterfeiters share is an often times incorrect handbag shape. The counterfeiter may get all the details correct, but the overall shape of the handbag may wrong. And this is something that a shopper might overlook because she is focusing on the tiny details, an the big picture goes unnoticed. Always take an overview of the handbag. Authentic Bottega Veneta bags will not appear lopsided or misshaped. They will always be perfectly symmetrical. Below is an image of a fake Bottega [taken directly from a site selling fakes]: You can't tell from the picture, but the actual dimenions are incorrect. The style "mini" may also be incorrect. So either case, the dimensions are wrong or the picture is the wrong bag, both are red flags. And the number one biggest tell...they spelled Bottega wrong! [They spelled it, Bettega]. The dimensions of this bag were listed as: Bettega Veneta Woven PU Leather mini Cabat [notice wrong spelling] Size: 16.9 (width at base) 5x6 (inch) [actual dimensions below] Below are some examples of correct dimensions of Bottega Veneta handbags: Cabat (mini): [correct dimensions for real Cabat (fake cabat) pictured above] Size (top width): 16in [15.9] (the replica added over an extra inch) width (at base): 6 inches (replica was narrow by .4) Other Bottega dimensions: Sloane: Side to side: 17.5in Side to side at base: 13in Vintage Milano: Base to top of handle: 10 inches Base to top of bag: 7 inches Side to side: 12.5 inches Base width: 5in Pryamid 12.5 x 10.5 x 6.6 Dustbags: An authentic Bottega Veneta dustbag will be a superior quality to most fake Bottega bags you will encounter. An authentic Bottega Veneta dustbag will can be a myriad of colors, from beige suede, to maroon, to Tiffany style green w/embossed logo font. It will be in the correct range, but not exact. Dustbag two tone colors schemes: Tan & light brown w/dark brown logo Brown & gold logo Maroon & gold logo [dustbag for shoes] Brown & silver logo Dark blue & gold logo [leather hangtag] Light brown & tan logo or Tan & brown logo Green & black logo Tut ref: miss_fancybags, fattinilimited.com, bagbible.com, purseforum.com live[ebay] Bottega Veneta Handbags New Bottega Veneta Pre-owned Bottega Veneta Hot!

But the one constant holding all of these changes together is the quality. Real Bottega labels will always be made of superior quality. There will be no sloppy lettering, bleeding colors, uneven spacing or asymmetric layouts. Color bleeding: In most cases, an authentic Bottega Veneta label should not have the print on one side of the label showing through on the reverse side of the label. The example (left) shows this detail. The tag on the left is held up with a good light source hitting from the far right, and nothing is showing through from the front side of the tag. A label with the front and the back printing showing through and blending with the opposing sides print is usually a sign of a cheaply made label. And remember, every detail of a Bottega Veneta is high quality, even the tiny elements like a fabric label. This does not mean that the label can not be translucent, and that light can?t pass through, or at times some of the print depending on the vibrancy that the lettering was struck. But as a rule of thumb, be aware of the relationship of the print on both the back and front of the label. Frayed edges: Another common denominator with the line of authentic Bottega labels is the unraveling of the fabric at the edges of the labels. This can be labeled perforations. Often times you will notice that there are strings of fabric dangling off the borders of the label, this is generally a common sign with the authentic Bottega Veneta labels. Below are images of authentic Bottega Veneta tags: Notice the frayed edges. Also the quality of the material. The material has noticable texture and weaving patterns. Contemporary Bottega auth tags: Always check for the authenticity label inside the bag. It is generally made of cotton, is a squared or rectangular shape and can be fastened directly into the handbag lining. Label code: The Bottega Veneta code has some similarities to authentic Balenciaga handbags. Below is an image of a Bottega Veneta serial number/model number: Three important figures are seen on the authenticity tag. The year made, the type of leather, and the color code. These should all match up with the bag that you have purchased. If the color code, year, or leather style says something different on the tag than what the handbag in question is representing, that is an obvious red flag. [The tag below would be a nero made in 2007]. 1. Color code 2. Leather style 3. Year made 4. Model number Below is an (incomplete) list of Bottega Veneta color codes: Bianco [9000] Maroon/brown?

The young actress appears in a short film called “The Curve of Forgotten Things,” a collaboration between Kate and Laura Mulleavy and director-photographer Todd Cole, with a score by Deerhunter. It will be premiered exclusively Tuesday on LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s Nowness.com, which footed the bill for the production. Cole and the Mulleavys previously worked together on a short fashion film (also done for Nowness) inspired by Rodarte’s spring 2010 collection, which was rather dark. This time the focus is softer, to match the clothes. Cole explains the concept: “It’s inspired by Northern California, and the Seventies. It’s about this girl who exists in this strange place outside of time. She’s digging up things from the land and the past, and she offers them to the sun.” Lest Nowness’ interest and cash reignite the rumors of LVMH’s interest in Rodarte, Cole says the site is just interested in original content. View Slideshow View Slideshow BOTTEGA BEACH ACTION: Palm Beach is getting some Bottega Veneta treats this month. Next Friday, the Italian luxury house will stage a spring fashion show at a luncheon at Club Colette hosted by Julia Koch, Lourdes Fanjul and Talbott Maxey, to benefit St. Jude’s Hospital, with both Bottega Veneta creative director Tomas Maier and president and chief executive officer Marco Bizzarri present. That night, Maier will kick off a four-day Bottega Veneta jewelry retrospective at his own namesake boutique. This all coincides with the launch of a limited edition Bottega Veneta collection for Palm Beach’s 100th birthday, which is exclusive to the brand’s Worth Avenue location and includes a hand-woven intrecciato nappa leather beach bag with a beach towel and sunglasses. “Everything is empire blue because the abundance and intensity of color is one of the best things about Palm Beach,” Maier said.

The book, penned by comics writer Rich Johnston, depicts the lives of Catherine Middleton and William Wales — as he’s known to his pals — together and apart. The first half of the book has been drawn by the Welsh artist Mike Collins and is Kate’s fictional diary. The second half, drawn by the Scottish artist Gary Erskine, follows William from Eton, to St. Andrews, and into the Royal Air Force. The 60-page comic culminates with the two on their wedding day, kissing. Already a preorder hit on Amazon, it will be sold from April 2.

Unfortunately, the time we show our men’s collection on the runway in New York market has come and gone.” Tahari is looking into several options for showing the collection in his Milan showroom next season, but for the moment, the men’s editors need not worry. The designer plans to show the collection at an event at his new, 2,000-square-foot men’s showroom in Manhattan on March 16.

The black-tie event, presented by sponsors including National Australia Bank, Woolmark and G’Day USA, honored Anthony Pratt, chief executive officer and chairman of Pratt Industries, for his business accomplishments and commitment to environmental causes in the United States. Pratt Industries is one of the largest paper and packaging companies in the U.S. “In the U.S., we employ 3,500 people in green-collar jobs, making us the largest Australian employer in America,” said Pratt. “Our company has sales of $1 billion in the U.S., and we plan to invest a further $1 billion over the next decade.” Comedian Rove McManus led the ceremonies. A three-time winner of a Gold Logie Award as Most Popular Personality on Australian Television, McManus responded to his enthusiastic welcome by saying, “Thanks, everyone, for pretending to know who I am.” View Slideshow View Slideshow Most Recent Articles In Fashion Scoops Most Recent Articles In Fashion Scoops Tory Burch Opening Milan Flagship H&M and Liberty Link Up on Men's Capsule TNT Stages Fashion Show With Gas Masks in NYC SNAKESKIN OR PIGSKIN?: As a commentator at Sunday’s “Uberbowl” at Joe’s Pub, Michael Musto is gearing up for game day by not doing anything Super Bowl-related, not that he would otherwise. Musto caught a glimpse of something NFL-ish Thursday on TV, and quickly turned away. “That’s what I always would have done anyway. I simply don’t care — and that’s the point of this event,” he said. While the Steelers and the Packers battle it out on a big screen, Musto and other uninformed viewers — actress Kristen Johnston, Cintra Wilson, Lauren Ezersky and Patrick McDonald — will call the shots for the crowd. Even Musto was at a loss about how the names were drawn. “I guess he wanted a diverse bunch of commentators who wouldn’t know a tight end from an end table,” he said.
