That's both a statement of what's been common knowledge and a report this evening out of England, where a Sepp Blatter interview with the BBC led to the FIFA president's confirmation that deals were make between groups bidding for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. The 2018 World Cup was awarded to Russia in December. On the same day, Qatar was awarded the 2022 tournament. Both decisions were received harshly by the English-language press, particularly in England and the United States, nations whose bids to host the tournaments failed to win the approval of the executive committee. Per the BBC's interview (in comments published this evening at The Telegraph), Blatter says the Spain-Portugal group (2018 bidders) was acting in conjunction with the Qataris, creating a block of votes that supported Spain-Portugal for 2018, Qatar for 2022: "I’ll be honest, there was a bundle of votes between Spain and Qatar," Blatter said. "But it was a nonsense. It was there but it didn’t work, not for one and not for the other side." Paul Kelso, reporting for The Telegraph, tries to provide reason to question Blatter's assertion, though the logic is less salient than descriptive. Noting that the Spain-Portugal bid received seven votes in the 2018 process, Kelso extrapolates what similar influence may have done for the 2022 decision: If, as Blatter claimed yesterday, Qatar received the same seven votes, it provided more than half of the 12 they required to win. Whether Blatter or Kelso feel the block influenced the outcomes is likely irrelevant, for a couple of reasons. First, it's unlikely that we'll ever have enough certain information to examine the voting with the necessary detail. Even if we had interviews with every executive committee member, there would be reason to question if, with time to consider the outcomes and reactions, motives and stories have changed since the time of the vote. Even after committee member Chuck Blazer tried to confirm he voted for the United States, some questioned whether he was telling the truth. Second (and more to the point), people likely to be enraged by this quasi-revelation are likely people who already believed FIFA is run by Swiss Sopranos, England and the United States should form their own governing body (presumably playing two nation Word Cups), and nothing like this has ever happened before, be it in FIFA or any other organization that engages in political processes as a means of making decisions. It makes it much easier to stomach U.S. Soccer losing to Qatar if it's a product of an irrational process. That the process may actually be irrational is what will keep this story alive for 11 more years. Are you ready for it? Over a decade of brooding? The festering discontent of false expectations, survived by a constant stream of revelations, stoking sentiment set to be projected onto each hint of ill-preparedness we hear from Qatar between now and 2022? Last month, it was indignation about a January World Cup (FIFA should have to revote!) This month, it's vote trading. What ever angle comes with March's iteration of this meme, I'm sure it will get mention in this space.  Tweet Share on Twitter Share Share on Facebook  Share Share on Google Plus 7 Comments In This StoryStream Six FIFA Members Accused Of Wrongdoing In World Cup Corruption Scandal May 10 3 comments Six FIFA Executive Committee Members Accused Of Corruption In World Cup Voting Feb 7 7 comments Sepp Blatter: Vote Trading Took Place In 2018, 2022 FIFA World Cup Selections Dec 8 Timing Fail: FIFA President Sepp Blatter Labels England 'Bad Losers' 20 Updates Latest News This time we can't ignore First Take's dialogue ESPN3 Chronicles: 2-on-1 tennis is so sad, great The godfather of zone blocking Stephen A.

Last December we saw two scams which claimed the recipient had won a lottery supposedly connected with 2014 World Cup, to be hosted in Brazil. We were surprised to see scams promoting an event so far in the future, so we were especially surprised to recently see a scam promoting the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Evidently scammers are not concerned by the fact that the tournament is over ten years away, with tournaments in Brazil and Russia before. The scam itself is fairly normal. The mail contains very little content in the body; it simply encourages recipients to open the attached PDF document: 419 Scam: Qatar World Cup 2022 example email   The attached PDF document was created with a popular open source office suite, and claims that the recipient has won £1.5m (roughly $2.41m). The document contains a logo for the tournament as a watermark, and also contains a picture of FIFA president Sepp Blatter with Qatar Football Association president Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed al-Thani. 419 Scam: PDF Attachment relating to Qatar World Cup 2022   Like many 419 or advance fee fraud scams, the message encourages recipients to email the scammer to claim, or to phone a forwarding number, which often routes the call to the scammer abroad. Although these messages, like most 419/advance fee fraud scams, are sent in low volumes, there are many variations, and are a nuisance. This mail was blocked automatically for a wide variety of recipients. It will be interesting to see how 419/advance fee fraud scams continue to take advantage of this and other high-profile events.

Home About Us Qatar 2022 Corporate Immigration Translation Latest News General banners Search GO   Qatar 2022 The 2022 FIFA World Cup will be the 22nd FIFA World Cup, an international football tournament that is scheduled to take place in 2022 in Qatar. The competition will take place in June and July, and involve 32 national teams, including that of the host nation. This is the first time a country in the Middle East will host the World Cup. In 2010, the economy of Qatar grew at a rate of 16%, and next year is estimated to grow 19%, but the Qatar Exchange is expected to gain the most. The decision of FIFA had a significant impact on the performance of the local stock market index, as the Qatar Exchange exceeded its historic ceiling of 8,500 points after winning the bid. Qatar winning bid for the World Cup would provide strong support to the stock market in the coming period, and will cause a jump in trading volumes and values, affecting overall performance of the market. The market index of the Doha Securities Market should increase to approximately 11,000 before the end of next year, 30% at least. This estimate gives investors promising opportunities for significant gains, putting the Qatar Exchange at the forefront of global financial markets during the coming years. These benefits were a projected outcome for the State of Qatar, which has pledged investments up to $75 billion into infrastructure, public facilities, sports facilities, tourism, communications, and transportation to cope with the importance of this massive global sporting event. Events such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup have put Qatar as a possible alternative to Dubai for business and foreign investment. Additionally, Qatar has recently announced that it would invest large sums of money to promote the country on the tourist map of the world, which will be positively reflected on the service companies, tourism, and related industries.   Careers Contact Us Sitemap Copyright © 2010 afreno.com.

Visit Team Stream on BleacherReport.com! × MLS Expansion: 10 Best and Worst Places for Major League Soccer to Expand By Jo-Ryan Salazar , Senior Analyst Feb 2, 2011 Share Tweet « Prev 1 of 22 Next » Use your ← → (arrow) keys to browse the slideshow Neilson Barnard/Getty Images 28.7K Reads 104 Comments Major League Soccer has come a long way from its humble beginnings at the dawn of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Now there is talk of the league expanding to accomodate more teams. At one point in time, you may see as many as 25 teams taking part in this competition. Which markets deserve a shot at expansion? And which markets don't? Bleacher Report investigates. Begin Slideshow » « Prev 2 of 22 Next » Worst: Honolulu or Anchorage Obviously this is a no-brainer. Why should Hawaii or Alaska be considered to be MLS markets to begin with? Hawaii does have a decent climate for football, but the travel costs make this venture impossible, even with Aloha Stadium passing off for a decent football pitch. As for Alaska, not a chance. Stick to hoops or ice hockey, you folks up there! Say no to far-flung states, MLS. « Prev 3 of 22 Next » Second Worst: Los Angeles Victor Decolongon/Getty Images We've already got the Galaxy. We've already got Chivas. Why should there be a third MLS team in the Los Angeles area? It's ridiculous. This market is already saturated with two viable sides and is off limits to expansion. « Prev 4 of 22 Next » Third Worst: Boston Jim Rogash/Getty Images Like the New England Patriots have a grip of Boston, the state of Massachusetts and the New England region in the NFL, so do the Revolution in MLS. A second Boston team is completely unnecessary, and is a market that is also off limits. Never mind that it also has the Red Sox, Bruins and Celtics as other major players... « Prev 5 of 22 Next » Fourth Worst: Chicago David Banks/Getty Images Just like Boston, Chicago already has the Fire as their flagship MLS side. It already has to contend with the Bulls, the White Sox and Cubs, the Blackhawks and Da Bears for exposure. Chicago does not need a second team to share the rent with the Fire at Bridgeview's Toyota Park. This city is off limits to expansion. « Prev 6 of 22 Next » Fifth Worst: Any Major City in the Pacific Northwest Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images Seattle's has their Sounders. Portland's has their Timbers. And Vancouver's has their Whitecaps. Other cities in the region like Tacoma, Spokane, Boise, Victoria or Eugene should not even be mentioned as viable MLS cities. You already have your Cascadia Cup power trio that will be fighting each other for bragging rights, so no more expansion is necessary. Three cities is enough. The Pacific Northwest: off limits. « Prev 7 of 22 Next » Sixth Worst: Columbus or Any Small-to-Medium Sized City in the Midwest Jamie Sabau/Getty Images Columbus already has the Crew. They don't need any other team. Cleveland is out of the equation, because Columbus already has their back. And who would think that Des Moines, Iowa would be a good place for Major League Soccer to expand. Just make the drive down to Kansas City, Kansas and support Sporting, will you? « Prev 8 of 22 Next » Seventh Worst: San Francisco/Oakland Brian Bahr/Getty Images Curse you, San Jose. You destroyed any hopes for San Francisco or Oakland to get their own MLS team back in 1996. Yes, those San Jose Earthquakes are not just representing the Silicon Valley. They are also representing San Francisco and Oakland. It's the entire San Francisco Bay area. San Francisco County, San Mateo County, Contra Costa County, Alameda County, and Santa Clara County. All covered by the Quakes. Sorry MLS, but this market is off limits. « Prev 9 of 22 Next » Eighth Worst: Baltimore Baltimore does not need an MLS team. There is a certain team that is already representing their town, just down the I-95. It starts with DC, and ends with United. Yeah, I figured you would know what I'm talking about. « Prev 10 of 22 Next » Ninth Worst: Las Vegas Even though Glitter Gulch will lay claim to fame as the place where MLS was officially launched, it does not need an MLS team. Who would want to play in a city that is like Doha during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but without the air conditioners? If you were to put your money on Las Vegas getting a team, the house would gain the advantage. « Prev 11 of 22 Next » Tenth Worst: Any City in North Carolina Attention, attention...the Carolina Railhawks and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill already dominate the soccer market here in the Tar Heel State. Albeit, the Tar Heels play under rules that won't really prepare its players for the big time, but that's a different story. Oh yes, and the Charlotte Eagles also play in USL PRO and are primed for a big year. North Carolina does not need an MLS team, end of story. « Prev 12 of 22 Next » Tenth Best: San Diego Donald Miralle/Getty Images A city with a rich soccer tradition (and Club Tijuana of the Liga de Ascenso is next door!) deserves to have an MLS team, to rub shoulders with the Padres and Chargers and Aztecs. And the Toreros, too. While its fans flock up north to Carson to watch Chivas USA or the Galaxy, San Diego fans won't have to drive far if they get one of their own. America's Finest City is ready for MLS. Come, all you interested owners and businesspeople. « Prev 13 of 22 Next » Ninth Best: Minneapolis-St. Paul A Major League Soccer team in Minneapolis would be a welcoming sight for fans used to watching the Wild, the Vikings, the Timberwolves and the Twins. Currently, there is a team called the NSC Minnesota Stars, which competed in the non-sanctioned North American Soccer League. Could it be a cry for help? « Prev 14 of 22 Next » Eighth Best: Phoenix The Phoenix area is home to the USSF Development Academy Winter Showcase, and has a rich soccer tradition, in the same mold as San Diego. As one of the largest cities in the country, having an MLS side in the Valley of the Sun could result in intense rivalry opportunities with Real Salt Lake and the Colorado Rapids. « Prev 15 of 22 Next » Seventh Best: Detroit Last year, Detroit hosted an international friendly between AC Milan and Panathinaikos, which drew about 30,000 to the Pontiac Silverdome. Greek-Canadian Andreas Apostolopoulos, the new owner of the Silverdome, has made it a priority for the city of Detroit to have its own MLS team. In the process, the Silverdome would either be renovated, or a new stadium would be created in its place. In a city dominated by the Tigers, the Red Wings, the Lions and Pistons, is Detroit ready for Major League Soccer? Bleacher Report thinks so. « Prev 16 of 22 Next » Sixth Best: Ottawa All right, so there are Canadian MLS teams in Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal, with the latter set to begin play next year. But what about other cities in Canada looking to get a piece of the pie? One city that could become the fourth is Ottawa, Ontario, the nation's capital. Frank Clair Stadium, as part of Lansdowne Park, is undergoing redevelopment as a prospective venue for a Canadian Football League team. And of course, it has hosted many soccer matches before, the most recent being those from the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. The Ottawa Fury, a side that competes in the USL Premier Development League, is looking to field a professional team for the 2013 season at Frank Clair. « Prev 17 of 22 Next » Fifth Best: St. Louis St. Louis is a city that feels they are up to the challenge of fielding a successful MLS team. But it can't settle for a team playing in the minor leagues, as was the case for the failed venture that was A.C. St. Louis. The only team that is relevant in the area are the St. Louis Lions of the PDL. The right investments need to be made before St. Louis gets its MLS team. But with the Cardinals and Rams garnering success in years past for their respective sports, there is no reason why it can't be the same in Major League Soccer. « Prev 18 of 22 Next » Fourth Best: Tampa-St. Petersburg The Tampa-St. Petersburg area previously had the Mutiny as one of the original MLS teams, but after a few seaons, they folded. Still, this is a region that deserves a second chance at fielding a successful, financially viable team in MLS. The city is used to success as a championship town, with the Tampa Bay Rays (American League), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFL) and Tampa Bay Lightning (NHL) winning league championships in the past decade. « Prev 19 of 22 Next » Third Best: Atlanta Mike Zarrilli/Getty Images The South tends to be overlooked by Major League Soccer in the expansion race. If the league has no plans to dive into Florida, it can always look to Atlanta, Georgia as beachhead. Already Atlanta—known for its Thrashers, Falcons, Hawks and Braves—is stating its case with the arrival of the Atlanta Beat in Women's Professional Soccer and the continued longevity of the NASL's Atlanta Silverbacks.  The success of both the Silverbacks and the Beat, as well as the support, will be determining factors as to whether or not MLS decides to expand into Atlanta within the next ten years. « Prev 20 of 22 Next » Second Best: Miami The early days of MLS saw the Miami Fusion play their matches at Fort Lauderdale's Lockhart Stadium, which is now the current home of Miami FC of the NASL. Expansion of Lockhart Stadium or the construction of a new soccer-specific stadium in the city will be needed if MLS decides to give Miami a second look. Otherwise, the Miami metropolitan area—known for the Heat, the Dolphins, the Florida Panthers and the Florida Marlins—have the potential of fielding a team in MLS in the future. « Prev 21 of 22 Next » Best: New York City Neilson Barnard/Getty Images This is where MLS will most likely expand next: their own backyard. The league offices are located in New York City. It has been one of MLS Commissioner Don Garber's wishes and three words tell the writing on the wall. New York Cosmos. The revival of the Cosmos can only mean one thing: the search for the next MLS expansion team may be drawing to a close. If the Cosmos are indeed the 20th MLS side, the seeds of a rivalry with Harrison, New Jersey's Red Bull New York will be sown. The Cosmos will need to secure a stadium, and if the borough of Queens can give the green light and construction can take place in earnest, the next team in Major League Soccer will be in the heart of New York City.

Dorsey , Correspondent Feb 8, 2011 Share Tweet Next ARTICLE » Use your ← → (arrow) keys to browse more stories Stanley Chou/Getty Images Bitter rivals: Blatter and Bin Hammam 218 Reads 22 Comments Asian Football Confederation (AFC) President Mohammed Bin Hammam will run against FIFA President Sepp Blatter in elections scheduled for June in a move that is certain to expand Qatar’s influence in world soccer, according to a tweet by outgoing FIFA vice president Chung Mong-joon. Chung’s tweet is the first public confirmation that Bin Hammam, a Qatari national with close ties to the Gulf state’s ruling family, who is locked into a bitter dispute with Blatter, will challenge the FIFA president in a bid to end his 12-year tenure. "I had lunch with Bin Hammam, the AFC president today,” Chung wrote on his Twitter account. “It seems he will challenge the FIFA presidential election in June.” World Football Insider quoted a source close to Chung as saying that it was “90 per cent” certain that Bin Hammam would stand against Blatter. Candidates for the FIFA presidency have to declare before April 1. Chung is scheduled to step down as FIFA vice president in June after last month losing an AFC election to Prince Ali Bin Hussein of Jordan, a half-brother of Jordanian King Abdullah, Blatter protégé and Bin Hammam critic. Some analysts believe that in a demonstration of Arab solidarity Prince Ali may shift his allegiance once Bin Hammam declares formally. Chung suggested that Bin Hammam would enjoy the support of all 46 Asian federations. “A FIFA president from Asia is a good thing. We all support him,” he said. A Bin Hammam electoral victory would be a further crowning of Qatar, which in December became the first Middle Eastern state to be awarded the right to host a World Cup. Critics have charged that the tiny Gulf state’s rise despite a soccer tradition or a large fanbase is fuelled by its energy-derived wealth. Blatter on Monday appeared to be anticipating Bin Hammam’s challenge by admitting for the first time that Qatar and Spain and Portugal colluded to trade votes for their respective 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. The admission casts a shadow over Bin Hammam’s criticism of the FIFA president as well as his calls for greater transparency within soccer’s world body. Bin Hammam has suggested Blatter needed to be replaced to repair FIFA’s image tarnished by a number of corruption scandals. Blatter also sought to remove a major dispute with European soccer institutions by dropping his suggestions to hold the 2022 World Cup awarded to Qatar in winter to avoid the Gulf state’s scorching summer heat and that other Gulf states should co-host the world’s biggest sporting event. Blatter’s call for moving the Qatar World Cup sparked sharp criticism in European soccer because it would upset premier league schedules. Bin Hammam’s candidacy is likely to revive criticism of Qatar’s spending spree that helped it win its bid to host the 2022 World Cup. The spree pushed the envelope of FIFA bidding rules and has prompted calls for a review of those guidelines. Blatter’s admission of the alleged collusion between Qatar and Spain and Portugal is likely to reinforce those calls. James M. Dorsey authors The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer blog.
