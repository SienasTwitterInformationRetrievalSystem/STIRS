Investigators say the explosion, which happened in the arrivals hall, was caused by a suicide bomber. President Dmitry Medvedev vowed that those behind the attack would be tracked down and punished. He ordered increased security across Russia's capital, its airports and other transport hubs. Mr Medvedev also called an emergency meeting with officials and also postponed his planned departure for this week's World Economic Forum at Davos. Continue reading the main story Analysis Steve Rosenberg BBC News, Moscow Over the last decade, Russia has suffered a string of terror attacks - many in the Russian capital itself. Tonight police sources have hinted that the Domodedovo airport bombing, too, may be linked to Russia's most volatile region. President Dmitry Medvedev has admitted that poverty, corruption and conflict in the North Caucasus is Russia's biggest internal problem. But he, like Vladimir Putin before him, appears unable to find a solution that would bring stability to that region and peace to Russia. The airport - the busiest serving Russia's capital - is 40km (25 miles) south-east of the city centre. Russian investigators said two Britons were among the dead. Footage from mobile phones showed the arrivals area filled with smoke, with bodies strewn across the floor, shortly after the attack around 1630 (1330 GMT).BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said immediate suspicion about Monday's attack would fall on militants from the Caucasus region. Militant groups fighting in the Caucasus know how important the perception that the president and prime minister provide a secure society is, and to undermine that is a key aspect of their aims, adds our correspondent. Last March the Russian capital's underground system was rocked by two female suicide bombers from Russia's volatile Dagestan region, who detonated their explosives on the busy metro system during rush hour, killing 40 people and injuring more than 80.

Austrian traveller Dr Johann Hammerer: "Injured people were lying on trolleys" 'Almighty explosion' Airport spokeswoman Yelena Galanova told Interfax news agency that the explosion occurred in the international arrivals hall in a public area "to which people who are not passengers have free access". The hall was packed as several international flights - including one from the UK - had just landed. The device is thought to have contained the equivalent of 7kg (15lb) of TNT. According to eyewitnesses quoted by Russian TV's Vesti news programme, before detonating the explosives the bomber shouted: "I'll kill you all!" Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Briton Mark Green, who was on a British Airways flight that landed at the airport before the explosion, told BBC News there were thousands of people in the baggage collection area, baggage hall and queue for immigration at the time of the blast. "We were walking out through the exit of the arrivals hall towards the car, and there was this almighty explosion, a huge bang... my colleague and I looked at each other and said 'Christ that sounds like a car bomb or something', because the noise was, literally, it shook you," Mr Green told BBC News. He described scenes of panic and how he gave a drink of water to a bloodied Russian man whose face was blackened with soot. Witness Artyom Zhilenkov, 30, told Reuters news agency that some of the victims were taxi drivers lined up in the arrivals hall waiting for fares. Thick drops of blood and pieces of shrapnel were scattered across the snow-covered tarmac outside the hall, Interfax news agency reported. In the aftermath of the explosion, Mr Medvedev told Russian state television a commission of inquiry would be established "to conduct urgent on-the-spot investigations".

Because obviously there have been lapses, and we have to get to the bottom of this." A spokesman for Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told the BBC's Newshour programme that no government could protect all of its citizens from attack all the time. "(The) government is taking all (the) necessary measures," said Dmitri Peskov. "But the nature of terror is that none of us, none of the countries in this world, are free from this threat. None of us could ensure 100% security level." Police are hunting for three suspects in connection with the bombing, Russian media report. All flights from Domodedovo have been suspended since the blast, while incoming flights are being diverted to Moscow's Sheremetevo airport. US President Barack Obama condemned what he called an "outrageous act of terrorism", while Nato sent a message of solidarity to Russia's government. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy called for those behind the attack to be punished, and British Prime Minister David Cameron telephoned Russian President Medvedev to offer his condolences and support. "We should never allow the terrorists to win," said Mr Cameron. Were you at the airport? Did you see or hear anything? Send us your accounts using the form below.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS An explosion at Domodedovo Airport kills 35 people, Russian authorities say Another 100 or so people were injured in the Monday afternoon blast Russia's president says the explosion was a terrorist act Video on state TV shows a smoke-filled terminal with bodies and luggage strewn about Share your iReport photos and video with CNN. Please don't do anything that could put you at risk. Moscow (CNN) -- A suicide bomber attacked Moscow's busiest airport on Monday, killing 35 people and wounding about 100, authorities and state television said. The blast occurred around 4:30 p.m. at the entrance of the international arrivals section of Domodedovo Airport, the Itar-Tass news agency reported, citing a spokeswoman for the Russian Investigative Committee, Tatyana Morozova. State TV aired video of the smoke-filled terminal, including what looked like bodies and luggage on the ground. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called the bombing a terrorist attack and immediately ordered additional security at airports and transportation hubs around the country. Moscow police went on high alert in case of additional attacks. Gallery: Terrorist bombing at Moscow airport Moscow injured rushed away Where does airport blast leave security? Map: Domodedovo airport Russian Health Minister Tatyana Golikova said 35 people died in the blast and 93 people were hospitalized. Forty-one of those injured are in serious or critical condition, she said. Some people were given care outside of the hospital, while others were treated for hearing loss, fractures and smoke inhalation. Earlier, the Russian National Anti-Terrorist Committee had said 35 people died and 152 were wounded in the explosion. State TV, citing Russian authorities, said the attack was the act of a suicide bomber who stuffed a homemade bomb with small metal objects to make it more deadly, then activated it in a crowded area where many people were waiting for arriving passengers. CNN could not independently verify those claims. A heavy police presence remained outside the airport hours after the explosion, and more than 10 ambulances left the scene with lights flashing and sirens screeching. Domodedovo is 22 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of Moscow. According to the airport's website, it is the largest of Moscow's three airports, as well as the busiest in terms of passenger traffic. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for Monday's blast, though previous terror attacks in Russia have been blamed on militants from the North Caucasus region. In 2004, two airplanes that took off from Domodedovo exploded, killing at least 89 people in an attack linked to Chechen suicide bombers. An explosive device derailed an express train in November 2009, killing at least 26 people. Chechen rebels were blamed again. In March of last year, female suicide bombers linked to the group were accused of attacking subway stations in central Moscow during rush hour, killing some 38 people. Golikova said Monday's blast and its aftermath were similar to previous attacks. Witnesses react to Moscow bombing Moscow death toll expected to rise Russian PM addresses airport bombing 31 dead in Moscow airport explosion RELATED TOPICS Moscow Domodedovo International Airport Russia "This (character of injuries) is very similar to terror acts that we've seen recently. The types of wounds and the condition of the injured as well as what they communicate -- all this is very typical for those kinds of terrorist act situations, unfortunately," she said. Elina Bakhtina told state TV she was at the airport cafe she owns when the explosion occurred. "The blast must have been very strong, because our cafe is about 100 meters from the arrivals area. When we heard the blast, glass just started falling from the ceiling," she said. Tatyana Papova, who was waiting at passport control when the explosion occurred, told state TV that escalators stopped working at the baggage claim area and airport employees started breaking down walls to help clear people from the area. Incoming flights scheduled to land at Domodedovo were being diverted to Moscow's other airports, Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo, Russian TV said. However, airport spokeswoman Yelena Galanova told Russian state TV that the airport was "operating as usual." An airport employee, Andrei Surkov, told CNN that while the international arrivals area was closed, international passengers were being routed through the domestic terminal located on the other end of the airport. Lufthansa spokeswoman Claudia Lange said the airline has suspended all flights to Domodedovo until further notice. Members of the international community immediately offered their condolences and condemned the violence. U.S. President Barack Obama called the bombing a "premeditated attack against innocent civilians." British Foreign Secretary William Hague said British officials are "in urgent contact with Russian authorities to establish the facts and to provide consular support to any British nationals who may have been affected." According to preliminary information from Russian investigators, two British citizens were killed in the blast. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen condemned the attack and urged greater cooperation in the fight against terrorism, while German, French and Israeli leaders also offered their condolences. Will Geddes, terrorism expert and managing director of International Corporate Protection Group, called the bombing a "very significant terror strike." Read how the Moscow blast is expected to affect security worldwide "To strike in the airport -- which is fundamentally believed and understood by many to be one of the most secure types of installations in a city or in a country -- to have such a devastating attack with such a tragic result, means that they had planned this considerably well and gone ahead in achieving their aims," he said.

The blast erupted in the arrivals area of the Domodedovo airport at 4:40 p.m. Moscow time. In addition to the 35 dead, another 130 were injured in what investigators called a suicide bombing. Evgeny Khorishko of the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., told ABC News it was "too early to say" who may have been responsible. "As you know there was an explosion in Domodedovo. Preliminary version is that it was a terrorist attack," Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told reporters. "People were killed and injured in that blast. I have just talked to the Healthcare Ministry and Emergency Ministry... We need to do all we can to make sure that victims get immediate medical help. Many ambulances are headed for Domodedovo and I would like to express my condolences to relatives of the victims." Initial reports published earlier today by Russia's state news agency RIA said witnesses had seen two suicide bombers carry out the attack. Later reports pointed to a single attacker. On Twitter, one purported eyewitness, Ilya Likhtenfeld, said the bomb was on a man standing in a crowd near a cafe. U.S. President Barack Obama said he "strongly condemns this outrageous act of terrorism against the Russian people" and offered his condolences to those affected, according to a statement read today by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. The U.S. State Department said it has no indication that any Americans were among those killed or injured. Video taken inside the airport apparently minutes after the bombing shows the blast area full of smoke, with luggage scattered around the ground. Several bodies, prone and unmoving on the ground, are also visible. Emergency services are on the scene and have evacuated several people from the blast zone, witnesses said according to The Moscow Times. "All the injured r taken away. The bodies r not taken away," Likhtenfeld said on Twitter. "The investigation is going on. They r looking for the remnants of the suicide bomber." Medvedev said a special investigative committee would be established to look into the incident and is currently meeting with law enforcement and the mayor of Moscow in response to the explosion, Khorishko said. Security Measures Added Before Checkpoints in U.S., TSA Says In response to the attack, passengers traveling through airports in the U.S. may see "unpredictable" security measures today, the Transportation Security Administration said, including some checks before travelers reach the usual security checkpoints. "We are monitoring the tragedy at Moscow's Domodedovo airport. As always, we are working with our international partners to share information regarding the latest terrorist tactics and security best practices," the TSA said in a statement just hours after reports of the Moscow bombing emerged. "Passengers may continue to notice unpredictable security measures in all areas of U.S. airports, including before the checkpoint. These measures include explosive detection technology, canine teams and Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams, among other measures both seen and unseen."

Duncan Gardham and Damien McElroy 6:32AM GMT 25 Jan 2011 Comments According to reports, the warning even gave details of precisely where the bomb would be planted and yet the authorities failed to stop the attack. "The special services had received information that an act of terror would be carried out at one of the Moscow airports," a security source told the RIA Novosti news agency. "Agents were seeking three suspects but they managed to access the territory of the airport, witness the explosion which their accomplice carried out and then leave the airport," the source said. The website Lifenews.ru, which has close links with FSB, Russia's security service, reported: "A tip-off with a warning that something was being prepared appeared one week before the explosion. Even the place, by the customs, was named." Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president, admitted that security regulations were not being properly followed even though Domodedovo Airport boasts some of the most hi-tech scanning equipment in the world.

The blast happened in the "meet and greet" area of the international arrivals hall where passengers are met after they pass through customs control. A spokesman for the airport confirmed it was a "free access zone" that did not require a boarding pass to enter. The airport does have a series of metal detectors on the entrance to the arrivals hall to scan people who are there to meet relatives. These are not always operational. The blast will damage Russia's international image as it gears up to hold two major sporting events, the Winter Olympics in 2014 to be held in Sochi in the North Caucasus and the 2018 football World Cup. Domodedovo Airport is Russia's largest in terms of passenger numbers and serves international airlines including British Airways, Lufthansa and Swiss Air. In all, 77 airlines offer regular flights to Domodedovo, flying on 241 international and national routes, and there are five flights from Britain each day. Built in 1964, it is 26 miles (42 kilometres) south-east of the centre of Moscow and is the largest of the three major airports that serve the Russian capital. It is generally regarded as Moscow's most up-to-date airport, but its security procedures have been called into question. In 2004, two suicide bombers were able to board planes at Domodedovo by buying tickets illegally from airport personnel. The female suicide bombers, Islamic militants, blew themselves up in mid-air, killing all 90 people aboard the two flights. Philip Baum, the editor of Aviation Security International, said: "The problem is that metal detectors and X-ray machines are not effective at detecting bombs. "And as you ratchet up the number of checks, you have large numbers of people standing in line and the queues themselves can become targets."   Russia Travel » News » World News » In Russia   Inside the Yamal sinkhole   MH17 crash in pictures   MH17 crash site   Grin and bear it   Malaysia Airlines crash   Read more Europe news Young woman allegedly posts picture using mascara looted from crash site   Yekaterina Parkhomenko uploaded a photograph with the caption: 'Mascara from Amsterdam; to be precise, from the field.

Intelligence sources said that one of the squads was likely to have established a base, at a house in Moscow, where the suicide belts to be used in attacks were assembled. Russian security sources said yesterday that a male and female suicide bomber from the Black Widow brigades had carried out the bombing together. The attack had been closely supervised by three accomplices, who had watched from a distance and are now being sought by the authorities. A Russian security official said the bomb that ripped through Moscow's Domodedovo airport was carried by a woman who mingled in the crowd at arrivals. She then either set the bomb off herself or someone else detonated it using a remote-control device. An eyewitness said the woman had been dressed in black and had worn a veil, suggesting she may have been a 'Black Widow' suicide bomber from the North Caucasus region out to revenge the killing of her husband by Russian security forces.

"The terrorist was accompanied by a man. He was standing beside her and (the blast) tore off his head." Intelligence services have been embarrassed by the revelation that informants had warned of an attack on an airport in the Russian capital just weeks before the incident. Security experts said the tip-off had revealed that a criminal gang based in the Moscow suburbs was assisting a Chechen bombing making squad and that a suicide cell was travelling from a training camp. A newspaper close to Russia's FSB security service published what it claimed was a warning to Moscow police issued in December that said there was credible intelligence that a suicide squad made up of three women and one man from Chechnya was headed to Moscow. The memo said the team had spent time in Pakistan and Iran and that one of the women had a relative with a flat in Moscow that might be used as a bomb making factory. Another group of five Islamist militants trained in Pakistan was also expected to cross into Russia soon, it added. An al-Qaeda linked website said that the group Islamic Caucasus Emirate, led by the rebe Doku Umarov, was poised to claim it had staged the attack. It said that Russia's harsh military measures against independence activists in the Caucasus had provoked the attack. It said: "You disbelievers are the firewood of Hell. You will enter it." The daily Kommersant newspaper said security service officials were alerted to the extent of the threat when a woman accidentally blew herself up on New Year's Eve in Moscow. It later emerged that her husband was in jail for being a member of an Islamist terror group and that she and a girlfriend had been sent to Moscow from the internal Muslim republic of Dagestan to commit an act of terror. Russian media published a grisly picture of the male terrorist's severed head that was being circulated around police and security services in the troubled mostly Muslim North Caucasus region to see if anyone recognised him. The region, which includes restive internal Russian republics such as Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan, is in the grip of a growing Islamist insurgency and has served as a launching pad in the past for a series of deadly strikes on civilian targets in Moscow and other cities.   Russia News » World News » Europe » Damien McElroy » Andrew Osborn » In Russia   Inside the Yamal sinkhole   MH17 crash in pictures   MH17 crash site   Grin and bear it   Malaysia Airlines crash   Read more Europe news Young woman allegedly posts picture using mascara looted from crash site   Yekaterina Parkhomenko uploaded a photograph with the caption: 'Mascara from Amsterdam; to be precise, from the field.

The attack occurred at approximately 4:40 p.m. as passengers from several arriving international flights were leaving the airport after clearing immigration and customs. The attacker (or attackers; reports are still conflicting over whether the attack was conducted by a man or a man and a woman together) entered the international arrivals hall of the airport, a part of the facility that is outside the secure area and that is commonly packed with crowds of relatives and taxi and limo drivers waiting to meet travelers. Once the attacker was in the midst of the waiting crowd and exiting passengers, the improvised explosive device that he (or she) carried was detonated. It is not clear at this point whether the device was command-detonated by the attacker as a traditional suicide bomb or if the device was remotely detonated by another person. The attack was most likely staged by Islamist militants from Russia's Northern Caucasus region who have conducted a long series of attacks in Russia, including the Aug. 24, 2004, suicide bombings that destroyed two Russian airliners. The Domodedovo attack serves as a striking illustration of several trends we have been following for years now, including the difficulty of preventing attacks against soft targets, the resourcefulness of militants in identifying such targets and the fixation militants have on aviation-related targets. Soft Targets By definition, soft targets are those targets that are vulnerable to attack due to the absence of adequate security. Adequate security may be absent for a number of reasons, including disregard for the threat and lack of competent forces to conduct security, but most often soft targets are "soft" because of the sheer number of potential targets that exist and the impossibility of protecting them all. Even totalitarian police states have not demonstrated the capability to protect everything, so it is quite understandable that more liberal democratic countries do not possess the ability to provide airtight security for every potential target. Moreover, some measures required to provide airtight security for soft targets are often seen as intrusive by citizens of countries where personal freedom is valued and the financial cost associated with providing such security measures is often seen as excessive. There is an old security truism that states: "If you try to protect everything all the time you will protect nothing." Because of this reality, policymakers must use intelligence gained from militant groups, along with techniques such as risk assessment and risk management, to help them decide how best to allocate their limited security resources. While this will help protect the targets the government deems most sensitive or valuable, it will also ensure that some things remain unprotected or under-protected. Those things become soft targets. While most militants would prefer to attack traditional high-profile targets such as embassies and government buildings, those sites have become far more difficult to attack in the post-9/11 world. At the same time, the relentless pursuit of terrorist operatives by the United States and its allies has resulted in the degradation of the capabilities and reach of groups such as al Qaeda. Today the threat posed to the West stems primarily from grassroots militants and jihadist franchises rather than the al Qaeda core. While this has broadened the threat, it has also made it shallower, since grassroots operatives are far less capable of spectacular and strategic attacks than the professional terrorist cadre of the al Qaeda core. The combination of increased security at hard targets and the reduced capabilities of militant operatives has resulted in militant planners shifting their targeting toward softer targets, which are easier to attack. As a result of this shift, targets such as hotels have replaced embassies and other hardened sites in militant target selection. Generally, militants prefer to attack soft targets where there are large groups of people, that are symbolic and recognizable around the world and that will generate maximum media attention when attacked. Some past examples include the World Trade Center in New York, the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai and the London Underground. The militants' hope is that if the target meets these criteria, terror magnifiers like the media will help the attackers produce a psychological impact that goes far beyond the immediate attack site -- a process we refer to as "creating vicarious victims." The best-case scenario for the attackers is that this psychological impact will also produce an adverse economic impact against the targeted government. Unlike hard targets, which frequently require attackers to use large teams of operatives with elaborate attack plans or very large explosive devices in order to breach defenses, soft targets offer militant planners an advantage in that they can frequently be attacked by a single operative or small team using a simple attack plan. The failed May 1, 2010, attack against New York's Times Square and the July 7, 2005, London Underground attacks are prime examples of this, as was the Jan. 24 attack at Domodedovo airport. Such attacks are relatively cheap and easy to conduct and can produce a considerable propaganda return for very little investment. Shifting Fire In Russia, militants from the Northern Caucasus have long attacked soft targets, including buses, trains, the Moscow Metro, hotels, a hospital, a theater, a rock concert, shopping centers, apartment buildings, a school and now the soft side of Domodedovo airport. In the case of Domodedovo, the past two attacks involving the facility are a clear illustration of the process by which militants shift to softer targets in response to security improvements. In August 2004, Chechen militants were able to exploit lax security on the domestic side of Domodedovo in order to smuggle two suicide devices aboard two targeted aircraft, which they used to blow up the planes. In response to that attack, security at the airport was increased. The Jan. 24 Domodedovo attack seems to have confirmed the effectiveness of these security improvements -- the militants apparently believed they could no longer smuggle their suicide device aboard an aircraft. However, they adjusted their targeting and decided to conduct an attack against a vulnerable soft spot -- the arrivals hall -- located in the midst of the hardened airport target. From a tactical standpoint, the attack at Domodedovo was a logical response to increased security designed to keep explosives off aircraft. This attack also demonstrates, significantly, that the militants behind it maintained the intent to hit aviation-related targets, a fixation we have discussed for some time now. One reason for this fixation is the impact that aviation-related attacks have on terror magnifiers. This was seen in the international response to the Domodedovo attacks, which was much larger than the response to twin suicide bombings of the Moscow Metro in March 2010. Even though the Metro bombings produced more fatalities, they did not resonate with the international media as the airport attack did. This media response to the most recent Domodedovo attack was presumably enhanced by the fact that it killed several foreigners. This difference in international reaction is significant, and will certainly be noted by militants planning future terrorist attacks. In all likelihood, it will also serve to solidify their fixation on aviation-related targets and on soft targets such as arrival halls that are located in the midst of harder aviation targets. It must be noted, however, that this concept is not altogether new: Militants have long targeted the soft area outside airports' security hardlines. Ticket desks were attacked by the Abu Nidal Organization in Rome and Vienna in December 1985, and more recently the El Al ticket desk at Los Angeles International Airport was attacked by a gunman in July 2002 and an unsuccessful car bomb attack against the main entrance of the international airport in Glasgow, Scotland, was conducted by a grassroots jihadist in June 2007. In the wake of the Domodedovo attack, security has been increased in the arrival halls of Russian airports -- a step that has been instituted elsewhere in order to make the traveling public feel secure. However, such measures are costly and will tie up security personnel who will then be unavailable to protect other sites. Because of this, these measures will likely be short-lived, and airports will return to "normal" in a matter of months. Furthermore, even when security is increased in areas such as arrival halls, the very nature of airports dictates that there will always be areas outside the rings of security where people will congregate -- either to meet travelers or as they wait to clear security screening. While the threat can be pushed away from the airport building, in other words, it cannot be completely alleviated. Because of this, there will always be soft areas that are impossible to protect using traditional security measures. However, facilities that employ non-traditional security measures like protective intelligence and countersurveillance will be able to protect this type of soft area far more effectively than facilities relying solely on physical security measures. The bottom line for travelers and security managers is that plots to attack aviation-related targets will continue and the array of aviation-related soft targets such as ticket desks and arrival halls will remain vulnerable to attack. A persistent, low-level threat to these targets does not mean the sky is falling, but it should prompt travelers to take some simple steps that can help minimize the time spent on the soft side of the airport. And, as always, travelers should practice an appropriate level of situational awareness so they can see trouble developing and take measures to avoid it. Send us your thoughts on this report.
