By Rebecca Boyle Posted 02.05.2013 at 9:00 am 6 Comments Stem Cell Printer Human embryonic stem cells can be printed out with a valve-based printing technique, tailored to account for the cells' delicate properties. The cells were loaded into two separate reservoirs in the printer and were then deposited onto a plate in a pre-programmed, uniformed pattern. Colin Hattersley 3-D printers can produce gun parts, aircraft wings, food and a lot more, but this new 3-D printed product may be the craziest thing yet: human embryonic stem cells. Using stem cells as the "ink" in a 3-D printer, researchers in Scotland hope to eventually build 3-D printed organs and tissues. A team at Heriot-Watt University used a specially designed valve-based technique to deposit whole, live cells onto a surface in a specific pattern. The cells were floating in a "bio-ink," to use the terminology of the researchers who developed this technique. They were able to squeeze out tiny droplets, containing five cells or fewer per droplet, in a variety of shapes and sizes. To produce clumps of cells, the team printed out cells first and then overlaid those with cell-free bio-ink, resulting in larger droplets or spheroids of cells. The cells would group together inside these spheroids. Spheroid size is key, because stem cells need certain conditions to work properly. This is why very precisely controlled 3-D printing could be so valuable for stem cell research. After being squeezed out of a thin valve, the cells were still alive and viable, and able to transform into any other cell in the body, the researchers say. It's the first time anyone has printed human embyronic stem cells, said lead researcher Will Wenmiao Shu, a professor at Heriot-Watt. But ... why? Eventually, they could be used to print out new tissues, or as filler inside existing organs, which would be regenerated. It could even serve to limit animal testing for new drug compounds, allowing them to be tested on actual human tissue, said Jason King, business development manager at Roslin Cellab, one of the research partners. "In the longer term, [it could] provide organs for transplant on demand, without the need for donation and without the problems of immune suppression and potential organ rejection," he said in a statement. The team took stem cells from an embryonic kidney and from a well-studied embryonic cell line, and grew them in culture. They had to build a custom reservoir--let's call it an inkwell--to safely house the delicate cells, and then they added some large-diameter nozzles. A pressurized air supply pumps the cells from the inkwell into the valves, which contain pressurized nozzles on the end. The team could control the amount of cells dispensed by changing any of the factors, including the pneumatic pressure, nozzle diameter or length of time the nozzle stayed open. University Logo The logo of Heriot-Watt University shows how stem cells can be printed with great precision. Will Shu/Biofabrication At first the researchers printed droplets, but ultimately, they were so precise that they made cell spheroids in a variety of shapes and sizes, like the university logo above. One interesting wrinkle: The cells also formed spheroids in the inkwells. More work needs to be done to explain that. The researchers also took several steps to make sure the cells survived the printing process. Examining the results of several experiments, they found 99 percent of the cells were still viable after running through the valve-based printer. "This confirms that this printing process did not appear to damage the cells or affect the viability of the vast majority of dispensed cells," they write in their paper, which is being published in the IOP regenerative medicine journal Biofabrication. Stem cells are powerful because they can develop into any cell in the body. Embryonic stem cells, which are taken from human embryos in the earliest stages of development, can be developed into stem cell lines that can be grown indefinitely. This is kind of controversial, especially in this country. But medical researchers think they could be hugely promising for a whole host of human ailments--stem cells could differentiate into neurons, potentially replacing the ones lost in degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's; or they could differentiate into pancreatic cells, curing diabetes; and so on. Using a 3-D printer to produce gun parts has been pretty controversial, especially during the ongoing post-Connecticut-shooting gun debate. But that may be nothing compared to this. 3-D Printed Stem Cells Will Shu/Biofabrication Related Articles In First Stem Cell Stroke Trial, Scottish Patient Has Embryonic Stem Cells Injected Into His Brain Scientists Use Stem Cells To Create Mice With Two Genetic Fathers Scientists Use Stem Cells to Generate Human Eggs in the Lab Tags Technology, 3-D printer, embryonic stem cells, human embryonic stem cells, controversy, future of 3-d printing Photo Galleries Rss Super Moons, Huge Typhoons, And Other Amazing Images Of The Week Darwin's Library From the HMS Beagle—The Digital Edition High-Flying Rocket Plumes And Other Amazing Images Of The Week + More Photo Galleries 6 Comments phoenixamaranth 02/05/2013 at 9:50 am Stem cell research has proven that using embryonic stem cells are not necessary to grow and replicate stem cells, so I doubt this will be controversial. Most likely, it will be revolutionary for thrusting medical science forward.

The bonus is that these are easier to get and in higher quantities and most are simply thrown away after birth. Research in induced pluripotence is also going very well. All said there seems to be absolutely no reason for this to be controversial. The only reason that I can figure that embryonic stem cells would still be argued and debated for by anyone is that it relates to other ideological grounds. Ex: If it's not okay to kill embryos for stem cells maybe other reasons to kill embryos are wrong? Moral issues aside, it seems like the controversy is easily avoidable since embryonic stem cells are much less effective than every other source of stem cells.

People shouldn't have to suffer with these diseases. Using embryonic stem cells is not wrong by any means. Cells that are merely a few days old are not fetuses by any definition. I believe that if God is all powerful and omnipotent like he claims to be, then it would seem that by us killing a cell that's a few days old would hardly put a dent in his master plan. Let's just say this cell was considered a human in God's eyes with a unique soul that had been sent from Heaven by God to grow and live on Earth. I think that if we were to prevent that being from entering the Earth by killing it, then God would find some other means of sending that individual to the world, probably by putting that embryo into another woman where he would then use his powers to cause that embryo to be the one to be birthed. By us using an embryo, we're not stopping God's plan. We're not even making a bump in the path.

His/her death would cause many reactions that could be seen and felt here on Earth that God would frown upon. However, this is much different than a cell that's only a few days old. Also, the Bible is not very clear on its stance against the use of embryonic stem cells. Actually, the few remarks it does make regarding stem cells do not say anything about how we shouldn't use stem cells or that it would be bad to use them.

Cells that are merely a few days old are not fetuses by any definition." By your definition the "cells" as you wrote are not fetuses. By my definition and by the definition of those who can actually use logic the "cells" ARE an embryo. They are called 'Embryonic Stem Cells'. The adjective 'embryonic' indicates that cells are either an 'embryo' if all cells are used for an experiment or part of an embryo if some of them are used. They are not called 'tree' or 'frog' cells but 'embryonic'. The experiments on tree or frog cells are not a criminal undertaking but experiments on cells of an embryo are because a human in an embryo stage of life is given the status and value of a frog and then used and killed. If somebody did experiments on the stem cells of your arm or leg and to do so had to cut off your limbs and told you : 'it is all right, I am doing experiments only on the stem cells of your arm or leg but not on you', what would have been your answer ? A human being during his or her existence goes through the stages of life, pre-born and post-born. A pre-born stage of life is an embryonic stage. It might come as a shock to you but you also went through this stage of life and you had the same right to live then as you do now. You became a unique human life, you, when your mother's and your father's genetic codes/material combined in ONE cell to become the unique genetic 'book' of you, the process of your life started right then. You as one cell started to divide and grow immediately. If a 'scientist' then and there decided to make an experiment on embryonic you and at the end of it splashed what was left of you down a toilet, you see this as acceptable ? Was the Auschwitz doctor Mengele a criminal or not ? He did not do experiments on the humans, he did experiments on the subhumans who in his darwinian science book were on the level of the frogs because they were not persons. And they were not persons because they were not fully human, and they were not fully human because many people said so. You see how exciting the science is ? If you want to do experiments on a human life just twist a word or two, redesignate, rename, say "it" is not fully human, it is a blob of cells, a "blob", and then do your experiments. Utter magic, the reality changes with the changing of few words and a human being becomes disposable trash. You and your like are the prime example and proof of why the domain of the human life cannot be interfered with, decided about and experimented on by the democratic mob, the 'scientists' included. You are too easily swayed and bewitched by the words and actions of the conjurors of science whose truly satanic philosophy is 'The curiosity and the knowledge are above the morality.' Only the Church, the one that refuses to compromise with the 'science', has the exclusive right to judge on the questions relating to human life.

These inexorable innovations are taking place outside the US, all this hand-wringing notwithstanding. Only when we release science from the schackles of religion and short-sighted budget restraints will we recover the initiative in technology and create a 21st-Century economic renaissance.

Cornell University researchers showed it's possible by creating a replacement ear using a 3-D printer and injections of living cells. The work reported Wednesday is a first step toward one day growing customized new ears for children born with malformed ones, or people who lose one to accident or disease. It's part of the hot field of tissue regeneration, trying to regrow all kinds of body parts. Scientists hope using 3-D printing technology might offer a speedier method with more lifelike results. If it pans out, "this enables us to rapidly customize implants for whoever needs them," said Cornell biomedical engineer Lawrence Bonassar, who co-authored the research published online in the journal PLoS One. This first-step work crafted a human-shaped ear that grew with cartilage from a cow, easier to obtain than human cartilage, especially the uniquely flexible kind that makes up ears. Study co-author Dr. Jason Spector of Weill Cornell Medical Center is working on the next step – how to cultivate enough of a child's remaining ear cartilage in the lab to grow an entirely new ear that could be implanted in the right spot. Wednesday's report is "a nice advancement," said Dr. Anthony Atala, director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, who wasn't involved in the new research. Three-dimensional printers, which gradually layer materials to form shapes, are widely used in manufacturing. For medicine, Atala said the ear work is part of broader research that shows "the technology now is at the point where we can in fact print these 3-dimensional structures and they do become functional over time." Today, people who need a new ear often turn to prosthetics that require a rod to fasten to the head. For children, doctors sometimes fashion a new ear from the stiffer cartilage surrounding ribs, but it's a big operation. Spector said the end result seldom looks completely natural. Hence the quest to use a patient's own cells to grow a replacement ear. The Cornell team started with a 3-D camera that rapidly rotates around a child's head for a picture of the existing ear to match. It beams the ear's geometry into a computer, without the mess of a traditional mold or the radiation if CT scans were used to measure ear anatomy. "Kids aren't afraid of it," said Bonassar, who used his then-5-year-old twin daughters' healthy ears as models. From that image, the 3-D printer produced a soft mold of the ear. Bonassar injected it with a special collagen gel that's full of cow cells that produce cartilage – forming a scaffolding. Over the next few weeks, cartilage grew to replace the collagen. At three months, it appeared to be a flexible and workable outer ear, the study concluded. Now Bonassar's team can do the process even faster by using the living cells in that collagen gel as the printer's "ink." The 3-D technology directly layers the gel into just the right ear shape for cartilage to cover, without having to make a mold first. The next step is to use a patient's own cells in the 3-D printing process. Spector, a reconstructive surgeon, is focusing on children born without a fully developed external ear, a condition called microtia. They have some ear cartilage-producing cells in that tissue, just not enough. So he's experimenting with ways to boost those cells in the lab, "so we can grow enough of them from that patient to make an ear," he explained. That hurdle aside, cartilage may be the tissue most amenable to growing with the help of 3-D printing technology, he said. That's because cartilage doesn't need blood vessels growing inside it to survive.

A 3D printing technique that produces clusters of stem cells could speed up progress towards creating artificial organs, Edinburgh scientists have claimed. In the more immediate future it could be used to generate biopsy-like tissue samples for drug testing. The technique relies on an adjustable "microvalve" to build up layers of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It has been developed by scientists at Heriot Watt University. Those involved in the research said it could pave the way for specially created organs, which might eliminate the need for organ donation. 3D printing technology has been increasingly used in numerous industries, ranging from creating clothes, architectural models and even chocolate treats. Scientists have long been experimenting with the 3D printing of cells and blood vessels, building up tissue structure layer by layer with artificial cells. Dr Will Shu, from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, said: "We found that the valve-based printing is gentle enough to maintain high stem cell viability, accurate enough to produce spheroids of uniform size, and most importantly, the printed hESCs maintained their pluripotency - the ability to differentiate into any other cell type." Animal-free testing Embryonic stem cells, which originate from early stage embryos, are blank slates with the potential to become any type of tissue in the body. Continue reading the main story “Start Quote This is a scientific development which we hope and believe will have immensely valuable long-term implications” End Quote Jason King Rolsin Cellab In the long term, the new printing technique could pave the way for hESCs being incorporated into transplant-ready laboratory-made organs and tissues, said the researchers. The 3D structures will also enable scientists to create more accurate human tissue models for drug testing. Cloning technology can produce embryonic stem cells, or cells with ESC properties, containing a patient's own genetic programming. Artificial tissue and organs made from the cells could be implanted into the patient from which they are derived without triggering a dangerous immune response. Jason King, business development manager of stem cell biotech company Roslin Cellab, which took part in the research, said: "Normally laboratory grown cells grow in 2D but some cell types have been printed in 3D. "However, up to now, human stem cell cultures have been too sensitive to manipulate in this way. "This is a scientific development which we hope and believe will have immensely valuable long-term implications for reliable, animal-free, drug testing, and, in the longer term, to provide organs for transplant on demand, without the need for donation and without the problems of immune suppression and potential organ rejection." The research is published in the journal Biofabrication.

Search for: Learning Teaching Common Core Technology Apps iPad Culture Social Media PD 10 Ways 3D Printing Can Be Used In Education [Infographic] 02/19/2013, TeachThought Staff, 1 Comment How 3D Printing Works 3D printing sounds like something from science fiction, but the process is similar to that of CNC machining, where billets are cut into specific shapes and products. But rather than cutting, it prints. A 3D printer works by “printing” objects–but instead of using ink, it uses more substantive materials–plastics, metal, rubber, and the like. It scans an object–or takes an existing scan of an object–and slices it into layers it can then convert into a physical object. The result is a product that while not as intricate, durable, or functional as the real-world equivalent, is otherwise a real thing that didn’t exist 30 seconds before you printed it. In fact, what it is you’re actually producing depends on what is being printed: if it’s toy jewelry, rubber balls, and plastic chess pieces your after, you’re printing not an analogue of the real thing, but the real thing itself. Confused yet? As far as how this can be used in education, it’s a matter of bringing objects out of the computer screen and into the hands of students for inspection, analysis, and other processes that can benefit from physical manipulation. In that way, 3D printers may eventually be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the digital–use a screen to find what you need, then print it into existence.  Crazy. 11 Ways 3D Printing Can Be Used In Education 1.
