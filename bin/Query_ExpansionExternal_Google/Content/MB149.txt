Should Football Be Fundamentally Changed to Make It Safer? Sunday marks one of the biggest events in American sports, the Super Bowl, with the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers facing off in New Orleans. Though the game is likely to be one of the most-watched events of the year, it comes at time when the National Football League is dealing with increasing scrutiny about the danger of the sport. A number of scandals and tragedies have plagued football in recent years. Last year, the New Orleans Saints were found to have sponsored a "bounty" program for its players, with players winning cash prizes for injuring opponents. The NFL suspended Sean Payton, the Saints' head coach, without pay for a year, and enacted similar punishment on players and coaching staff involved, but many critics believe the penalty was not enough and worry that similar bounty programs exist at other teams. Recent studies have also found that NFL players suffer from neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's at a rate three times greater than the general population. A number of high profile tragedies also reflected the dangerous toll football takes on the brain. Former NFL linebacker Junior Seau shot himself in the chest, leaving a suicide note asking that his brain be studied for science. Kansas City Chief's Jovan Belcher killed his girlfriend before shooting himself in the team practice facility. Another study found that the suicide rate among NFL players to be six times the national average. That goes without saying the wear and tear football takes on other parts of the body. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has said that the league is very concerned with player safety. The NFL donated $30 million for brain injury research to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. It has also changed some of its rules to make the game more safe, like the so called "Steelers rule," which will punish teams for players who commit multiple flagrant hits. However some fans, and even some of the players, have objected to this and other rule changes, saying it is making football "too soft." Nevertheless, even President Obama joined the chorus of those concerned about the game's safety, telling The New Republic, "I think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence."

EDITIONS: USA ESPAÑOL More Australia Brazil United Kingdom CITIES: BOSTON CHICAGO DALLAS LOS ANGELES NEW YORK ESPN NFL Shop Roger Goodell talks football safety Updated: March 6, 2013, 10:17 PM ET ESPN.com news services Recommend Tweet Comments Email Print Recommend Tweet Comments Email Print Subscribe OTL: A House Divided Since becoming NFL commissioner in 2006, Roger Goodell has earned the respect of the league's owners and the criticism of many of its players for his handling of a number of issues, including the Saints bounty scandal. Tags: Matt Birk, Drew Brees, New Orleans Saints, Anthony Hargrove, Baltimore Ravens, NFL OTL: A House Divided CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says the league will continue to do "everything we can" to make football safer. Player safety in the NFL has been a frequent topic of conversation recently and Goodell discussed it again Wednesday during a lecture and question-and-answer session at the department of exercise and sport science at the University of North Carolina. "We know that in order to secure the future, we can and must do more to make the game safer, and in the process, we will make other sports safer as well," Goodell said. Following his speech, Pro Football Talk reported that Goodell denied that he made comments in an ESPN The Magazine piece saying he fears an NFL player will die on the field. Goodell called for "a culture of safety for every sport" and welcomes the national conversation about player safety and the growing issue of concussions. OTL: His Game, His Rules Roger Goodell has made the NFL bigger, richer and more powerful -- and now more divided -- than ever before, Don Van Natta Jr. writes. Story The NFL is facing concussion-related lawsuits from thousands of former players. In a series of interviews about head injuries with The Associated Press in December 2011, 31 of 44 players said they wanted the league to have independent neurologists at games. Goodell said the league "will continue to make rule changes, invest in equipment and provide our medical staffs with the tools and authorities" to prevent injuries. "Medical decisions override everything else," he said. "We know that our actions set an example." Goodell said concussions are down 40 percent in the two seasons in which kickoffs were moved 5 yards to the 35-yard line, a change designed to create more touchbacks and fewer returns. "Players and coaches have adjusted (to rule changes). They always do, but there is more work ahead," Goodell said. "We will find other ways to take the head out of the game. The helmet is for protection. It should not be used as a weapon." Goodell pointed to the NFL's recently announced partnership with General Electric to develop ways to improve head protection. "Science can be a game-changer in making sports safer," he said. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

Obviously the sport is not safe if this many people are having problems. The only thing we can do is make it safer. A ton of people have committed suicide too. Is it really worth it? Report Post Like Reply (Maximum 900 words) Submit Yes TE is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain that causes the atrophy of brain tissue and the build up of tau protein (usually good but when defective it causes dementias). Symptoms of CTE are memory loss, aggression, confusion, and depression which can lead to suicide. CTE is diagnosed post-mortem (after death). Research has also suggested that untreated concussions can also cause other disorders later in players lives such as anxiety and depression. A disorder that isn’t really long-term called Second Impact Syndrome or SIS for short is also dangerous, it is from back to back concussions people who have suffered from SIS are usually disabled or dead. What steps are leagues and organizations taking to make the game safer? With all of this talk about how dangerous contact sports are and how kids shouldn’t play them nobody is talking about what the different leagues and organizations are doing to make the game safer. The NFL and NHL are installing new rules that severely punish hits to the head. The NFL and USA football are starting the Heads Up football program which educates young players about concussions and develops a tackling method where the tackler puts their head up to prevent concussion. Report Post Like Reply (Maximum 900 words) Submit They Should The NFL should make football safer and they are constantly taking steps to do so. The organization is constantly researching new ways to make injuries and minimal as possible and it has been somewhat successful. They are also doing other thing such as having neurologists on the sidelines at all of the games played. Posted by: MichaelKnight1 Report Post Like Reply Challenge (Maximum 900 words) Submit The NFL should not make football safer. The NFL has already taken every precaution to make the NFL as safe as possible. If you were to change rules to make it safer than you are changing the sport itself. Also, players are being paid millions ot play this game so they already know the risks involved. There is no reason to change anything, they know what they are getting themselves into. Report Post Like Reply (Maximum 900 words) Submit Absolutely Not! If the NFL happened to make the game safer, that would just make the game less entertaining overall. This would cause less contact and no more big hits that a lot of people enjoy. I do think that players should be getting fined for illegal hitting. The way the NFL rules are right now are the best they can be. Football is still entertaining to watch and not to many people are getting severe injuries. Report Post Like Reply (Maximum 900 words) Submit It is as safe as it will get The NFL has modern safety equipment and is already doing a fairly good job at protecting players compared to the old equipment. If football were to be made safer, then the rules would have to change to define what a tackle or a down is. This would ruin the game entirely. So, unless a super protective new material came out, the game can't get any safer without ruining the game because the NFL also needs to be enjoyable to watch. Posted by: alexluis Report Post Like Reply Challenge (Maximum 900 words) Submit NO These are adults that are making the decision to play and are getting very good compensation for the most part. They are given extensive medical reviews and treatment if there is any kind of injury. The league is doing what it can to make things safer for the players, but nothing is ever going to be full-proof or perfect. We have people getting limbs blown off in a desert halfway around the world that are making a fraction of what these football players make. I think that we need to let them be adults and make their own decisions. Nobody goes into it thinking that it's all rainbows and gentility, and the league does what it can.

Want to Make Football Safer?.........Eliminate Helmets. By Mark Tyler  @PSUHomer on Feb 16 2013, 11:45a 37 Stephen Brashear Should the NFL Look to Change Helmets?  Tweet Share on Twitter Share Share on Facebook  Share Share with Redskins friends 37 Comments Much has been made about player safety, and it should be that way. Too many serious injuries occur in professional football today. The game is ever changing, right before our very eyes, and that change is not about to come to an end anytime soon. Head injuries, more specifically concussions, have moved to the forefront of the awareness seen around the league. The rash of lawsuites brought against the league by former players magnified the issue even more. The players accused the league of hiding information from them about the seriousness of concussions, and the long-term effects they can have on the quality of life these players live. This from President Obama (via an article written by Paul M Barett from Bloomberg Businessweek on Jan, 31st, 2013) - "I’m a big football fan," President Obama told the New Republic in an interview, "but I have to tell you, if I had a son I’d have to think long and hard before I’d let him play football." Obama, who roots for the Chicago Bears, predicted that "those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence." Via NY Times: Head Injuries in Football According to findings published in the scientific journal Brain in December 2012, the growing evidence of a link between head trauma and long-term, degenerative brain disease was amplified in an extensive study of athletes, military veterans and others who absorbed repeated hits to the head. The study, which included brain samples taken posthumously from 85 people who had histories of repeated mild brain injury added to the mounting body of research revealing the possible consequences of routine hits to the head in sports like football and hockey. The possibility that such mild head trauma could result in long-term cognitive impairment has come to vex sports officials, team doctors, athletes and parents in recent years. Of the group of 85 people, 80 percent (68 men) — nearly all of whom played sports — showed evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative and incurable disease whose symptoms can include memory loss, depression and dementia. Among the group found to have C.T.E., 50 were football players, including 33 who played in the N.F.L. Among them were stars like Dave Duerson, Cookie Gilchrist and John Mackey. Many of the players were linemen and running backs, positions that tend to have more contact with opponents. So the question becomes, what can we do to make the game safer? Eliminate Helmets(or helmets as we know them today). Today's helmets( like the one pictured below) are designed to protect players from serious head and face injuries, but are the helmets providing a false sense of security to NFL players? The quality, design and safety of these new helmets make a player feel invincible. They are more apt to lead with the crown of these helmets than they were in the past because the quality is so much better than it was even 10 years ago. The safer the helmets are made, the more the players will use them to punish an opponent. What if these players didn't have this type of protection? What if the only thing that stood between their head and a opposing player was a much thinner composite type of headgear, designed to absorb little impact, but not a full-fledged blow to the head, like we see in the construction of today's helmets. Also, what if these helmets had an open face? Would players be so willing to lead with their head, with such little protection? The image below is something the NFL could use as a prototype. It's almost like bringing back the old leather helmets, just with a new, revolutionized look. via www.popsci.com The final idea would be to lessen the upper-body padding a player could wear. The idea of this would be to minimize the blow delivered to the head of an opposing player, by one who is leading with their shoulder pads. A thinner, lighter, more streamlined design would limit the amount of vicious hits, and make for a much more agile athlete. For those of you thinking this would ruin the game, take a look at rugby. It is very violent in it's nature, but has been around much longer than professional football. Sure we see injuries in rugby, but they are no where near as serious as we see in the NFL.

Goodell said in a speech at the University of North Carolina on Wednesday that he believes the future of football depends on changing the game, and he sees that as one of his primary missions. “If there’s any single reason for the incredible success of the NFL, it’s because we’ve never allowed ourselves to be complacent about anything,” Goodell said. “There is a national conversation taking place about football. We welcome it. That’s how we approach our jobs every day: Looking at changes to the game not as something to be feared, but as something we need to do as if the future of the game relies on it. Because it does. The risk of injury in football is well known, but throughout history, football has evolved and become safer and better.” Goodell mentioned the importance of reducing the brain injuries that players suffer on the field, although he also stressed that football is far from the only activity that risks brain injury, and he noted a study that found that NFL players live longer than the American population as a whole. “In recent years there has become a sharper focus on concussions in football and other sports. Let me make an important point here: Concussions are a global issue. Not just a football issue,” Goodell said. “We can and must do more to make the game safer, and in the process we will make other sports safer as well.” Goodell said health and safety will continue to be his highest priority. And he’s willing to change the game of football to make it safer.

If it doesn’t change we all will be like our grandfathers talking about how awesome boxing is/was. wahooskinsfan says: Mar 6, 2013 12:45 PM “so let’s play 18 games every season!” jags2daship says: Mar 6, 2013 12:46 PM I’m pretty sure the ginger hammer wont be happy until they are playing two hand touch. I never want to see a player get hurt but you have to understand the risks of playing such a physical game. It’s not if you get hurt but when you get hurt and the only way to solve people getting hurt is to destroy the game we love to watch. tobiasjodter says: Mar 6, 2013 12:48 PM He is changing professional football into flag football. You can no more eliminate violence in football than you can eliminate it in boxing or Mixed Martial Arts. He is attacking the very essence of American’s most popular game by trying to limit “aggression” when aggression is its core value just like boxing, just like mixed martial arts. Steeley McBeam says: Mar 6, 2013 12:48 PM No, it doesn’t. jessieboom says: Mar 6, 2013 12:48 PM ….to an 18 game season. F yea. xxwhodatxx says: Mar 6, 2013 12:48 PM Someone, ANYONE, stop this man! pacific123ocean says: Mar 6, 2013 12:51 PM I call BS on the study that found NFL players lived longer than the American population as a whole. Can anybody provide a link, or reference to this study? kylexitron says: Mar 6, 2013 12:51 PM It’s time for Goodell to go. a couple more missteps and ego-laden power plays foiled and he will be removed. Guarantee it. He’s awful for the game. skiss68 says: Mar 6, 2013 12:51 PM How bout if its not broke dont fix it!! You really need to stop the excessive fines u are giving out to the players!! They deserve every penny they get because the next game could be their last! Give them community service or make them visit childrens hospitals but stop taking their money!!! carmelaanthonysoprano says: Mar 6, 2013 12:51 PM What a hypocrite. patriotinvasion says: Mar 6, 2013 12:51 PM Football as it was, with big hits and “jacked up” segments on ESPN made it so popular. All it needed was a little boost from Fantasy and the Internet and it became even bigger. Trying to take the contact out of the game will only hurt one of the best aspects of the sport. Concussions are nothing new and the players assume the risk just like a police officer assumes the risk of getting shot when he signs up to be a police officer. Let’s leave well enough alone. talkingheadsknowall says: Mar 6, 2013 12:52 PM Let’s start changing the game by getting rid of Roger Goodell (RG1). Getoffmylawn! says: Mar 6, 2013 12:52 PM Randy Marsh had this figured out a while ago. jwreck says: Mar 6, 2013 12:54 PM broncobeta says: Mar 6, 2013 12:44 PM As much as it sucks, he’s right. If it doesn’t change we all will be like our grandfathers talking about how awesome boxing is/was. _________ Boxing ended because it doesn’t work well in a television format and attending events live isn’t as exciting or important as it used to be. Chances are if the game is changed we will still be like our grandfathers, talking about how great football was, because it will no longer be the same sport. nyg201 says: Mar 6, 2013 12:55 PM Wants to make the game safer… Total BS! How bout those Thursday games. drewsylvania says: Mar 6, 2013 12:57 PM What about the 25 years of looking the other way on head injuries? I guess that was proactive and not complacent? glac1 says: Mar 6, 2013 12:58 PM Facts are facts…. and like it or not…he’s speaking of facts. jagsfan1 says: Mar 6, 2013 12:58 PM Instead of changing the game – can we just change the Commissioner? yourignorancespreads says: Mar 6, 2013 1:02 PM Get this guy out if office now. I’m sick Everytime I see this guy on some headline. I hate what he is doing and I hope others feel the same because he is changing something that we called our own to something he sees as a money maker compared to what it should be. If you are suppose to teach kids by example then all this fool is doing is allowing kids to think that all thy have to do is get into a position of authority in any company and the rules so that they benefit from the changes. What a shame. It’s a sad time in the NFL right now. usmutts says: Mar 6, 2013 1:04 PM This guy could care less about the health and safety of players except to the extent that it adversely impacts the pocketbooks of his megalomaniacal, narcissistic bosses. blackandbluedivision says: Mar 6, 2013 1:05 PM Exactly, because it did a horrible job lasting this long. It has to change now. catfanatic1979v1 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:06 PM I love Goodell when it comes to player discipline and the financial side of things. However, when it comes to player safety he governs like someones overprotective mom. And if he is so concerned about safety, why not alter the protective gear instead of making all of these rules changes? I’m sure there are some materials out there that would help absorb shock better. fwippel says: Mar 6, 2013 1:06 PM Okay, Roger, you want to make the game safer? Start by getting rid of those idiotic weekly Thursday night games which are held for one purpose: to get the league’s network more exposure. Until you do that, no one is going to believe that you are taking safety seriously. 4thqtrsaint says: Mar 6, 2013 1:07 PM The headline should have read “Goodell Tries To Publicly Avoid Litigation” 52crabcakes says: Mar 6, 2013 1:07 PM And he is ruining the game I will probably stop watching before I die! It’s football people. ramitbaby says: Mar 6, 2013 1:08 PM The future of football relies on replacing Roger Goodell. Was the NFL struggling before this egomaniac took the job? Am i missing something? One thing I remember clearly, however, is that it was affordable to attend a game under Tagliabue. SilentMajority says: Mar 6, 2013 1:08 PM Why do I even read the comments? Ok, I’m going to type really slow for the people who need it. If you improve player safety and health you can play an 18 game season…safely. I know, that was a really complicated type of reasoning. cooklynn17 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:09 PM Please get a clue: although I am old school and love seeing fools get pasted and lit up (favorite player was Lawrence Taylor) I understand doing everything possible to make the game safer. The issue I and most other fans have is completely changing the game. Do not do that! Like eliminating the kickoff, well because the Jacoby Jones kickoff in the Superbowl wasn’t exciting or anything. And it didn’t effect the outcome of the game or anything, this is what I am talking about. At the end of the day, its football. People will yesterday, today and tomorrow always get hurt no matter what we do. Cars are safer and are getting safer every year……..people still get hurt and some die. It is what it is. Players get paid a lot of money to take those risks and I would bet you could cut each player’s salary by 50% and they would still play football. Because if they didn’t someone else would. Bottom line, make it as safe a possible but don’t change the very essence of the game. nirvana504 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:09 PM The man is a known liar & has zero credibility. His main focus is fighting the concussion lawsuit, not safety. misterchainbluelightning says: Mar 6, 2013 1:09 PM There is no NFL if parents keep refusing to let their kids PLAY FOOTBALL as kids. Which is happening. The NFL is DEAD in 25 years on it’s current course, Billionaires invested in the game knows this, but your average fan (buffoon) doesn’t. But they sure do have their silly opinions on the matter. finer9erfan says: Mar 6, 2013 1:15 PM I hate what he says. “We have to change the game”. No we don’t need to change it, we need to EVOLVE it. Are there things that can be evolved that limit the risk of players on the field. Absolutely! The equipment can be modified, educating players on ways of taking/making hits, etc. However, when you say CHANGE, you mean to modify a game in a way that challenges the integrity of the sport. No sir. I don’t want YOUR NFL. csilojohnson says: Mar 6, 2013 1:15 PM Thanks for the reassurance you will continue to ruin this league. Just think in two years time it will be arena football with a sideline. I just wish he would pull the bandaid off quick. Put flags on them next year and be done with it. Or just do a punt pass and kick competition. You could have the defense count 10 mississippi before they rush. romosmicrodongs says: Mar 6, 2013 1:16 PM he’s about to ban the zone blocking scheme and low blocks benroethlisberger7 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:16 PM Remember the game that we all have grown to love because soon all we’ll have are those memories. Greed ruins everything. InFact says: Mar 6, 2013 1:17 PM Goodell’s comments will be mined by lawyers in the future who hope to keep lawsuit payouts to a minimum after he convinces owners that 18 games will make them billions more. When is a brave reporter going to ask Goodell about his schizophrenic agenda of making football safer while advocating an 18 game schedule occur? vertskate900 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:18 PM What he doesn’t get is that if he keeps up what he’s doing there may be “football” in the future, but it will be a watered down version which no one will care to watch anyway thus ending football. Oh and can someone tell me how when a defender leads with his shoulder on a hit and then gets mistakenly called for a helmet to helmet hit with a 15 yard penalty…how that makes the game “safer?” That’s the kind of crap that Goodell is implementing. steeelfann says: Mar 6, 2013 1:18 PM The future of the game, as well as the United States, is getting us out from the suppression of tort law. Until we get all of the lawyers out of the senate, we will continue to nose dive. And that is the truth. marvsleezy says: Mar 6, 2013 1:19 PM He is turning this league into flag football! Except for that one time, when that really big guy hit that other guy right in the head, and the guy went down hard and didnt get up too quickly. But besides that one time, the NFL is now like flag football!! jjthesportsguy says: Mar 6, 2013 1:19 PM Every man who has ever strapped a helmet on has seen and is aware of what may happen to themself by playing football. Goodell would make a good mom. “I hope you guys don’t get hurt.” What he doesn’t make is a very good businessman. There is no reason to change the most popular event in the United States. braven4evr says: Mar 6, 2013 1:20 PM Yeah Roger, keep changing the game. Why not make it two hand touch? titansfan1950 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:20 PM Of course NFL players live longer than the average population. You have to be three years removed from high school to play. That means no adolescent deaths are included in the players’ average lifespan. Apples vs. Oranges. ken0west says: Mar 6, 2013 1:22 PM Is the NFL even a top 10 “dangerous” job? I just don’t see how player safety is an issue in the NFL/NCAA. If the NFL wants to support youth safety that is fine, but the men who play the game in college and the NFL know the risks and can make their own choices. coltzfan166 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:23 PM Ha it’s kinda entertaining to watch you idiots comment about how you hate Roger Goodell. Just carry on as if you know everything sterling7 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:23 PM The way it was played in the 60’s and 70’s would be just fine with me. eaglesooneru2 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:24 PM I call BS on the study that found NFL players lived longer than the American population as a whole. ————————————————— It doesn’t surprise me that retired players live longer on avg. most may have bad knees , etc but they tend to have more money plus a degree and opportunities for a career after football that makes living a little less hard. Of course there are broke retirees too so I’m not broad brushing but retired nfl players probably have more savings and access to better health care than the average joe sadskinsfan89 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:25 PM The dudes lost it. Please leave the game alone. furryarcher says: Mar 6, 2013 1:25 PM to those who keep referencing the 18 game season as a point of Roger Goodell’s hypocrisy: he wants to make the game *inherently* safer so that it won’t matter whether there are 16, 18, or 14.2 games in a season. and to those who point out that football is an inherently violent game: if football can’t be changed in a way that removes the “inherent” risk of brain damage and other serious life-changing health issues, then it will not survive in a modern society, and the people whose main draw to football is the violence will have to search for another profitable and socially acceptable business that frequently stages violent human-on-human collisions and often leaves the participants injured or disabled. zar21 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:26 PM The future of football relies on changing the commissioner willyalistentothis says: Mar 6, 2013 1:31 PM 1. End talk of the 18 game season. It’s hard to take the NFL serious on the safety issue until this issue is dropped for good. 2. Permit more contact in the secondary. The five yard rule has drastically increased the speed of play in the and has helped produced some of the most violent plays in football. I am shocked that nobody talks about this low hanging fruit. I think it is a case where the $s outweight the safety issue. guitarmaninks says: Mar 6, 2013 1:50 PM No boxing ended because the best heavy weight athletes now play safety or linebacker in the NFL. skinsfan596 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:50 PM Right, he wants to change the game by making it safer, but isnt going to crack down and start enforcing hgh testing and testing for other ped’s. Instead hes gonna suspend guys for taking adderoll. WHAT A JOKE… Goodell needs to go before he ruins the game boobschannel says: Mar 6, 2013 1:57 PM he meant to say the future of his and the owners bottom line – ie: profit margins – relies on changing the game intto the lingerie league FinFan68 says: Mar 6, 2013 1:59 PM He’s wrong. Changing the game as he envisions will lead to the demise of NFL football. Rather than trying to eliminate the violence and aggression via vague and subjectively enforced rules, maybe he should work on eliminating the ability for suing the league. Liability waivers. sb44champs says: Mar 6, 2013 2:01 PM misterchainbluelightning says: Mar 6, 2013 1:09 PM There is no NFL if parents keep refusing to let their kids PLAY FOOTBALL as kids. Which is happening. The NFL is DEAD in 25 years on it’s current course, Billionaires invested in the game knows this, but your average fan (buffoon) doesn’t. But they sure do have their silly opinions on the matter. ============================= Man, took the bait hook, line and sinker lol jdvalk says: Mar 6, 2013 2:08 PM Two more regular season games and international travel will make the game much safer, right? thebrownswillalwaysloose says: Mar 6, 2013 2:08 PM Extra games, Thursday games, Goodell is such a hypocrite! I get player safety but like boxing, MMA and many other sports the game comes with inherent risk’s involved. The players know this but many of them also know it’s their only chance at any kind of a life. Particularly those who supposedly hold a college degree but can’t string three words together properly. Find ways to make it safe, ie: better helmuts, protection without turning the game into a two hand touch – candy cane league. cowboyhater says: Mar 6, 2013 2:13 PM To avoid injured players from going back out to the field too early, you allow teams to increase their roster size to have legitimate back ups to the starters, and increase their salary caps to allow for the additional players. Bottom line… teams force their star players to come back too early because there is not enough roster spots to have nfl starting caliber backups at each position. jeffa43 says: Mar 6, 2013 2:28 PM The future of Football relies on a change in commissioner. wludford says: Mar 6, 2013 2:30 PM The best way to make football safer is to return it to a more balanced game between run and pass. I’ve been watching NFL football for nearly 40 years and I haven’t noticed any decline in injuries- including serious injuries- as a result of rule changes. The truth is, the rule changes result in more passing plays, which is when more injuries- including serious injuries- occur. The nature of passing plays expose just about every position to greater risk of injury- from QB to CB to WR to linemen. If you take away the rule changes that make passing more favorable, there will be more balance between run and pass- as there used to be- with fewer injuries. And fewer ticky-tack penalties, flag-football games, jump-ball/fail-mary endings, and greater team vs. QB-centric play too. All of which is good for the game. Patriot42 says: Mar 6, 2013 2:32 PM As the government becomes more involved in every aspect of our lives it would not surprise me for football to be investigated by a committee and regulated to make it safer and Lord knows what it would become. We need to take back our rights to do what we want without the bleeding hearts telling us how we should live. If I want to jump out of a airplane without a parachute it should be my right. nflgiant says: Mar 6, 2013 2:40 PM The NFL needs to go back to a 14 game season with 2 bye weeks for teams. pghdc says: Mar 6, 2013 2:41 PM Phase in a weight limit! Reducing the weight of the players is the most logical way to reduce injury and improve the health of the players, during and after football. Take careful notice that the NFL never says it wants to improve the health of the players. Instead, they always use the word “safety”. You can bet this is on purpose. If the NFL is truly concerned for the players, they would not encourage them to live such dangerously unhealthy lives. Phase in a weight limit! Think of the thousands of young men who live their entire youth as obese men. Only a select few will ever play in the NFL. These boys are handicapped for life. The NFL leaves behind it a long trail of diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc… Football should be a game of strategy, strength, and athleticism. buffalobill85 says: Mar 6, 2013 2:43 PM it has nothing to do with long term safety, and brain injuries. it’s all about the short term. when a league who plays once a week in the national spotlight, it will do anything to avoid injuries to superstars. the league must have damn near had a heart attack when Brady went down in 08. Howard Rozelle does not care about long term trauma, only revenue. and to maximize both short term and long term profits, they’ll need to minimize injuries. ilovefoolsball says: Mar 6, 2013 2:44 PM We should call him Doughboy because all he wants is to make the owners some dough. tbtrojan says: Mar 6, 2013 3:07 PM If he keeps up the changes to the point he’s happy then going to an NFL game will resemble going to see Lynyrd Skynyrd tour in 2013 at $100 a ticket. The name is the same and there’s that 1 guy who might have been there all along but you don’t recognize anything else & you feel ripped off when it’s over. toonloonboon says: Mar 6, 2013 3:18 PM “If there’s any single reason for the incredible success of the NFL, it’s because we’ve never allowed ourselves to be complacent about anything,” This is a dumb, hollow stmt, typical of what business people in suits would say. So with this logic, my game of beer ping pong might becomse more successful because I run the league like a tyrant. Stupid. Hey dummy, why don’t you say the truth. The success of the NFL isnt about esoteric things. But about high energy action that appeals to the largest common denominator and the fact that its easy to gamble on. Dummy. westclaims says: Mar 6, 2013 3:19 PM Do you see the irony here? Attorneys screw up the game (concussion lawsuits etc), and then it’s left to attorneys like this guy to fix it. A bit of karma there as well. jr507 says: Mar 6, 2013 3:22 PM This man “cares” so much to protect multi-millionaires, yet has no problem with us working stiffs spending $5k on PSLs, $3k/annum on tickets, not to mention paying unconscienable prices at the concessions stand. Forgive me if I don’t lose sleep for the poor modern athlete when your average head-of-household would gladly chop years off his life in exchange for their millions of dollars which would allowing one to meet any of his family’s needs (like increasing cost of living, education, etc). harrisonhits2 says: Mar 6, 2013 3:33 PM This is the sad and pathetic result of allowing attorneys to take over every aspect of our lives. So clumsy or stupid as to spill hot coffee on yourself ? Obviously the seller’s fault and they should owe you a couple million. Play a game where concussions are common and you know full well what the dangers are ? Oops no such thing as informed consent, lets just all sue the league because we’re too stupid to manage the millions we’ve been paid so that we have money after football. melikefootball says: Mar 6, 2013 3:39 PM All the power to players but the money is out of bounds and is now starting to show. Look at the players redoing contracts which will catch up to teams. Look what is cost to attend a game pushing many out of the stadiums. your team could change drastically each year the way the money is flying around. i understand the making of money but where does the line get drawn. nolagirl says: Mar 6, 2013 3:40 PM Can someone please give this guy a Deacon Jones’ headslap, y’know… just for old times sake. mogogo1 says: Mar 6, 2013 3:46 PM One day Goodell will be viewed as the man who destroyed pro football. To save the game, he has decided they must destroy the game. And it has nothing to do with player safety, but everything to do with protecting the NFL from litigation. azarkhan says: Mar 6, 2013 3:52 PM Yes, let’s make pro football more like pro wrestling. Let’s see what kind of audience you have then, Roger. sfn155 says: Mar 6, 2013 4:19 PM Did his “study” count the millions of people who die or get life shortening illnesses before they would even be old enough to be eligible for the NFL? szwhtsup123 says: Mar 6, 2013 4:20 PM Women’s golf anyone? treesloth16 says: Mar 6, 2013 4:33 PM ‘The future of my $30mill job and legacy relies on making football as profitable as possible. We propose 18game schedules, 4 games within 20 days, competition with international teams 16hr flights away, and making scoring proliferative.’ How is safety involved here? Goodell’s ridiculous. mjkelly77 says: Mar 6, 2013 5:00 PM Short-term thinking imbeciles. You’d rather see the league fold under pressure from billion dollar litigation. A decade from now you’ll all be saying how you agreed with the strategic forward thinking of Commissioner Goodell, the man who saved the NFL. Idiots. FinFan68 says: Mar 6, 2013 8:24 PM To avoid injured players from going back out to the field too early, you allow teams to increase their roster size to have legitimate back ups to the starters, and increase their salary caps to allow for the additional players. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The NFL is not against an increase in roster size. The union is. The teams have X to spend on players per year via the salary cap. Whether they spend that money on 53 players or 63 players makes no difference to the teams. An increase in roster size would mean less money is available per player (fewer big contracts) so the union would not go along with it. dallascowboysdishingthereal says: Mar 6, 2013 10:53 PM Goodell the self proffesed savior of the modern NFL? Give me a break. sechristbmw says: Mar 6, 2013 11:50 PM Money is all this man cares about. $31 million in pay last season. That’s what this is about. Save the NFL from lawsuits behind the safety guise. Sure take away kick offs, take away punt returns, take out the three point stance- that’s what the fans want… Change the fabric of the game and make it Goodell ball. chi01town says: Mar 7, 2013 7:48 AM The NFL has been here for almost 100 years before Goodell and his safety bull sh#t. He is the one that opened the door for all these X players to say ( I bumped my head ) Now they want money that they didnt earn. I for one will not pay to see the players play catch.

(AP) — NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says the league will continue to do "everything we can" to make football safer. Goodell has talked a lot recently about player safety and he discussed it again Wednesday during a lecture and question-and-answer session at the department of exercise and sport science at the University of North Carolina. He's calling for "a culture of safety for every sport" and welcomes the national conversation about player safety and the growing issue of concussions. Goodell says the league "can and must do more to make the game safer" and pointed to the NFL's recently announced partnership with General Electric to develop ways to improve head protection. He says "science can be a game-changer in making sports safer" and wants to "take the head out of the game."
