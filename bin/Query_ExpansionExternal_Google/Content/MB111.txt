Will Water Shortages Unleash Instability in the Middle East? By Mina Akrami WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 20, 2013 Photo: Global Water Partnership Man drinking water. A NASA study, released last Friday, indicates that water shortages could affect millions in the Middle East. Images, captured by NASA’s twin Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, reveal significant water loss, in a period of six years, in the Tigris and Euphrates river basins—a region that includes parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. The study has focused attention on the Middle East’s water woes and the possible instability it could unleash in the region. The NASA study The rise and fall in water reserves alters the Earth’s mass, which influences local gravitational attraction. GRACE measures gravity, and thereby, tells how much a region’s water reserves change over time. “GRACE data show an alarming rate of decrease in total water storage in the Tigris and Euphrates river basins, which currently have the second fastest rate of groundwater storage loss on Earth, after India,” says Jay Famiglietti, the principal investigator of the study from the University of California, Irvine, quoted by NASA. According to the study, the majority of the water lost — approximately 73 million acre feet — was caused by reductions in groundwater. Famiglietti also said that irrigators turn to groundwater when drought reduces surface water. The Iraqi government drilled about 1,000 wells in response to the 2007 drought. According to a 2012 Yale study, the drought stunted agriculture in the Tigris and Euphrates river basins, causing thousands of people to flee Iran, eastern Syria, and northern Iraq. The NASA study shows just one part of the water crisis that the Middle East is undergoing. A study conducted by Maplecroft finds that of the top 20 countries suffering extreme or high water stress, 19 are in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Unsustainable water extraction and consumption Rich and poor Middle Eastern countries have exhausted groundwater supplies in their quest for self-sufficiency when it comes to food security. This was part of a “green revolution” that began in the 1970s. Often cited as an example of unsustainable water extraction and consumption practices in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has provided farmers virtually free electricity to pump ground water to the surface in its quest for food-security. Because of the water loss caused by these practices, the Saudi government plans to cease wheat production by 2016. In Yemen, where irrigated land tripled between 1970 and 2000, the capital, Sana’a, has come under severe water stress. A 2010 report by the Mckinsey Institute forecasts that if water consumption in the Sana’a basin is not controlled, the city could run out of water by 2020. A few oil-rich Arab countries are beginning to address water loss caused by groundwater extraction. Some of these countries have focused on desalination, a process that makes saline (salt) water into fresh water. According to a report by the Guardian, more than 1,500 plants line the Gulf and Mediterranean, providing most of the MENA region’s drinking water by separating salts and impurities from the water. However, the impurities extracted from the water end back in the sea, threatening marine life, which in turn affects fishing. According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates spend $3 billion every year on desalination. Political implications of water shortages Aside from the impact on the environment, water loss is problematic for the already unstable region as the demand for water continues to rise alongside population growth. According to the US Intelligence Community Assessment of Global Water Security, by 2030, the world’s water needs will exceed current sustainable water supplies by 40 percent, which could generate widespread instability and contribute to state failure in certain regions, including in the Middle East. Another report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) states: “the real wild card for political and social unrest in the Middle East over the next 20 years is not war, terrorism, or revolution — it is water. Conventional security threats dominate public debate and government…water is the true game-changer in Middle Eastern politics.” According to the report, water is a fundamental part of the social contract in Middle Eastern countries: governments rely on subsidized food and fuel, and cheap or free water to avoid dissent. While water has played a limited role in prompting unrest, permanent water loss will change water’s role in potential internal conflicts. Water shortages, according to some analysts, could also lead to international conflicts as governments act to ensure access to drinking water. Peter H. Brooks, writing for Foreign Policy, notes that more than anywhere else, the Tigris and Euphrates river basins — already affected by border disputes, conflicts over Kurdish autonomy, and the conflict in Syria — could become prone to transboundary water disputes. While launching the Blue Peace: Rethinking Middle East Water report in February 2011, Swiss foreign minister Micheline Calmy-Rey said: “In the future the main geopolitical resource in the Middle East will be water rather than oil." Calmy-Rey’s views are also shared by many in policy circles. However, Jon Alterman and Michael Dziuban of CSIS argue that while a large portion of the literature points to a relationship between water and conflict, in reality, several Middle Eastern countries have cooperated over water. For instance, in 1994 Jordan and Israel reached an agreement over the Jordan River and Turkey, Syria and Iraq have kept their water tensions manageable. Alterman and Dziuban believe that conflicts will instead be domestic. Land grabbing One response to water shortages has been to shift farming to Africa, an initiative led by the MENA countries along with China and South Korea. In Gambella, Ethiopia, to where Saudi Arabia has shifted much of its farming, there have been signs of unrest. In 2009, the Saudi Star Agricultural Development company signed leases for approximately 25,000 acres of land in Gambella, where it planned to produce rice for the Saudi market. In April 2012, five Saudi Star workers were killed in the company’s residential camp. To find the instigators, government soldiers searched local villages, torturing men and raping women. Moreover, Human Rights Watch reports that a policy of “villagization” enforced by the Ethiopian government for commercial land use has resulted in threats, intimidation, and violence against those who resist resettlement. Through villagization, scattered farming communities are grouped into small villages to promote rational land use, conserve resources, strengthen security, and provide access to clean water, health and education and infrastructure. However, the history of villagization in Ethiopia, as relayed in a Human Rights Watch report, illustrates a contrast to this rationale. The report notes that in the 1980s, these villages were often a source of forced labour for government projects, such as road construction, agricultural production, and other infrastructure development. Further, the report claims that villagization has involved and still involves human rights violations: government forces implementing and overseeing villagization burned property and committed theft, rape, torture and extrajudicial executions. Human Rights Watch claims that Saudi Star’s current land investment in Gambella has the potential to undermine the food security of the poor indigenous population. Currently, there are no limits on water use, which may have a significant negative impact on the local environment and on future agriculture practices. The Ethiopian government and Saudi Star present a different side of the issue. According to a May 2012 Bloomberg report, the Ethiopian government says resettlement has been voluntary and unrelated to the Saudi Star agriculture investment. The report also notes that to overcome local opposition, Saudi Star plans to offer jobs and training to the locals. It is unclear whether agriculture companies such as Saudi Star will employ more sustainable water practices in Africa and allow the locals to reap potential benefits of their agriculture investment. It is also unclear the extent to which these agriculture companies’ pursuit of water will create tension between the locals, the governments, and these foreign companies. Thus, as the Middle Eastern countries continue to seek ways to address water shortages at home and in Africa, only time will tell how important a role water will play in unleashing instability in the region and beyond.

Some of the largest lakes and rivers on the globe are being depleted at a very frightening pace, and many of the most important underground aquifers that we depend on to irrigate our crops will soon be gone. At this point, approximately 40 percent of the entire population of the planet has little or no access to clean water, and it is being projected that by 2025 two-thirds of humanity will live in "water-stressed" areas. But most Americans are not too concerned about all of this because they assume that North America has more fresh water than anyone else does. And actually they would be right about that, but the truth is that even North America is rapidly running out of water and it is going to change all of our lives. Today, the most important underground water source in America, the Ogallala Aquifer, is rapidly running dry. The most important lake in the western United States, Lake Mead, is rapidly running dry. The most important river in the western United States, the Colorado River, is rapidly running dry. Putting our heads in the sand and pretending that we are not on the verge of an absolutely horrific water crisis is not going to make it go away. Without water, you cannot grow crops, you cannot raise livestock and you cannot support modern cities. As this global water crisis gets worse, it is going to affect every single man, woman and child on the planet. I encourage you to keep reading and learn more. The U.S. intelligence community understands what is happening. According to one shocking government report that was released last year, the global need for water will exceed the global supply of water by 40 percent by the year 2030... This sobering message emerges from the first U.S. Intelligence Community Assessment of Global Water Security. The document predicts that by 2030 humanity's "annual global water requirements" will exceed "current sustainable water supplies" by forty percent. Oh, but our scientists will find a solution to our problems long before then, won't they? But what if they don't? Most Americans tend to think of a "water crisis" as something that happens in very dry places such as Africa or the Middle East, but the truth is that almost the entire western half of the United States is historically a very dry place. The western U.S. has been hit very hard by drought in recent years, and many communities are on the verge of having to make some very hard decisions. For example, just look at what is happening to Lake Mead. Scientists are projecting that Lake Mead has a 50 percent chance of running dry by the year 2025. If that happens, it will mean the end of Las Vegas as we know it. But the problems will not be limited just to Las Vegas. The truth is that if Lake Mead runs dry, it will be a major disaster for that entire region of the country. This was explained in a recent article by Alex Daley... Way before people run out of drinking water, something else happens: When Lake Mead falls below 1,050 feet, the Hoover Dam's turbines shut down – less than four years from now, if the current trend holds – and in Vegas the lights start going out. Ominously, these water woes are not confined to Las Vegas. Under contracts signed by President Obama in December 2011, Nevada gets only 23.37% of the electricity generated by the Hoover Dam. The other top recipients: Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (28.53%); state of Arizona (18.95%); city of Los Angeles (15.42%); and Southern California Edison (5.54%). You can always build more power plants, but you can't build more rivers, and the mighty Colorado carries the lifeblood of the Southwest. It services the water needs of an area the size of France, in which live 40 million people. In its natural state, the river poured 15.7 million acre-feet of water into the Gulf of California each year. Today, twelve years of drought have reduced the flow to about 12 million acre-feet, and human demand siphons off every bit of it; at its mouth, the riverbed is nothing but dust. Nor is the decline in the water supply important only to the citizens of Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. It's critical to the whole country. The Colorado is the sole source of water for southeastern California's Imperial Valley, which has been made into one of the most productive agricultural areas in the US despite receiving an average of three inches of rain per year. Are you starting to get an idea of just how serious this all is? But it is not just our lakes and our rivers that are going dry. We are also depleting our groundwater at a very frightening pace as a recent Science Daily article discussed... Three results of the new study are particularly striking: First, during the most recent drought in California's Central Valley, from 2006 to 2009, farmers in the south depleted enough groundwater to fill the nation's largest human-made reservoir, Lake Mead near Las Vegas -- a level of groundwater depletion that is unsustainable at current recharge rates. Second, a third of the groundwater depletion in the High Plains occurs in just 4% of the land area. And third, the researchers project that if current trends continue some parts of the southern High Plains that currently support irrigated agriculture, mostly in the Texas Panhandle and western Kansas, will be unable to do so within a few decades. In the United States we have massive underground aquifers that have allowed our nation to be the breadbasket of the world. But once the water from those aquifers is gone, it is gone for good. That is why what is happening to the Ogallala Aquifer is so alarming. The Ogallala Aquifer is one of the largest sources of fresh water in the world, and U.S. farmers use water from it to irrigate more than 15 million acres of crops each year. The Ogallala Aquifer covers more than 100,000 square miles and it sits underneath the states of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming and South Dakota. Most Americans have never even heard of it, but it is absolutely crucial to our way of life. Sadly, it is being drained at a rate that is almost unimaginable. The following are some facts about the Ogallala Aquifer and the growing water crisis that we are facing in the United States. A number of these facts were taken from one of my previous articles. I think that you will agree that many of these facts are quite alarming... 1. The Ogallala Aquifer is being drained at a rate of approximately 800 gallons per minute. 2. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, "a volume equivalent to two-thirds of the water in Lake Erie" has been permanently drained from the Ogallala Aquifer since 1940. 3. Decades ago, the Ogallala Aquifer had an average depth of approximately 240 feet, but today the average depth is just 80 feet. In some areas of Texas, the water is gone completely. 4. Scientists are warning that nothing can be done to stop the depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer. The ominous words of David Brauer of the Ogallala Research Service should alarm us all... "Our goal now is to engineer a soft landing. That's all we can do." 5. According to a recent National Geographic article, the average depletion rate of the Ogallala Aquifer is picking up speed.... Even more worrisome, the draining of the High Plains water account has picked up speed. The average annual depletion rate between 2000 and 2007 was more than twice that during the previous fifty years. The depletion is most severe in the southern portion of the aquifer, especially in Texas, where the water table beneath sizeable areas has dropped 100-150 feet; in smaller pockets, it has dropped more than 150 feet. 6. According to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. interior west is now the driest that it has been in 500 years. 7. Wildfires have burned millions of acres of vegetation in the central part of the United States in recent years. For example, wildfires burned an astounding 3.6 million acres in the state of Texas alone during 2011. This helps set the stage for huge dust storms in the future. 8. Unfortunately, scientists tell us that it would be normal for extremely dry conditions to persist in parts of western North America for decades. The following is from an article in the Vancouver Sun... But University of Regina paleoclimatologist Jeannine-Marie St. Jacques says that decade-long drought is nowhere near as bad as it can get. St. Jacques and her colleagues have been studying tree ring data and, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Vancouver over the weekend, she explained the reality of droughts. "What we're seeing in the climate records is these megadroughts, and they don't last a decade—they last 20 years, 30 years, maybe 60 years, and they'll be semi-continental in expanse," she told the Regina Leader-Post by phone from Vancouver. "So it's like what we saw in the Dirty Thirties, but imagine the Dirty Thirties going on for 30 years. That's what scares those of us who are in the community studying this data pool." 9. Experts tell us that U.S. water bills are likely to soar in the coming years. It is being projected that repairing and expanding our decaying drinking water infrastructure will cost more than one trillion dollars over the next 25 years, and as a result our water bills will likely approximately triple over that time period. 10. Right now, the United States uses approximately 148 trillion gallons of fresh water a year, and there is no way that is sustainable in the long run. 11. According to a U.S. government report, 36 states are already facing water shortages or will be facing water shortages within the next few years. 12. Lake Mead supplies about 85 percent of the water to Las Vegas, and since 1998 the level of water in Lake Mead has dropped by about 5.6 trillion gallons. 13. It has been estimated that the state of California only has a 20 year supply of fresh water left. 14. It has been estimated that the state of New Mexico only has a 10 year supply of fresh water left. 15. Approximately 40 percent of all rivers in the United States and approximately 46 percent of all lakes in the United States have become so polluted that they are are no longer fit for human use. The 1,450 mile long Colorado River is a good example of what we have done to our precious water supplies. It is probably the most important body of water in the southwestern United States, and it is rapidly dying. The following is an excerpt from an outstanding article by Jonathan Waterman about how the once mighty Colorado River is rapidly drying up... Fifty miles from the sea, 1.5 miles south of the Mexican border, I saw a river evaporate into a scum of phosphates and discarded water bottles. This dirty water sent me home with feet so badly infected that I couldn’t walk for a week. And a delta once renowned for its wildlife and wetlands is now all but part of the surrounding and parched Sonoran Desert. According to Mexican scientists whom I met with, the river has not flowed to the sea since 1998. If the Endangered Species Act had any teeth in Mexico, we might have a chance to save the giant sea bass (totoaba), clams, the Sea of Cortez shrimp fishery that depends upon freshwater returns, and dozens of bird species. So let this stand as an open invitation to the former Secretary of the Interior and all water buffalos who insist upon telling us that there is no scarcity of water here or in the Mexican Delta. Leave the sprinklered green lawns outside the Aspen conferences, come with me, and I’ll show you a Colorado River running dry from its headwaters to the sea. It is polluted and compromised by industry and agriculture. It is overallocated, drought stricken, and soon to suffer greatly from population growth. If other leaders in our administration continue the whitewash, the scarcity of knowledge and lack of conservation measures will cripple a western civilization built upon water. But of course North America is in far better shape when it comes to fresh water than the rest of the world is. In fact, in many areas of the world today water has already become the most important issue. The following are some incredible facts about the global water crisis that is getting even worse with each passing day... 1. Total global water use has quadrupled over the past 100 years, and it is now increasing faster than it ever has been before. 2. Today, there are 1.6 billion people that live in areas of the globe that are considered to be "water-stressed", and it is being projected that two-thirds of the entire population of the globe will be experiencing "water-stressed" conditions by the year 2025. 3. According to USAID, one-third of the people on earth will be facing "severe" or "chronic" water shortages by the year 2025. 4. Once upon a time, the Aral Sea was the 4th largest freshwater lake in the entire world. At this point, it less than 10 percent the size that it used to be, and it is being projected that it will dry up completely by the year 2020. 5. If you can believe it, the flow of water along the Jordan River is down to only 2 percent of its historic rate. 6. It is being projected that the demand for water in China will exceed the supply by 25 percent by the year 2030. 7. According to the United Nations, the world is going to need at least 30 percent more fresh water by the year 2030. 8. Sadly, it is estimated that approximately 40 percent of the children living in Africa and India have had their growth stunted due to unclean water and malnutrition. 9. Of the 60 million people added to the cities of the world each year, the vast majority of them live in deeply impoverished areas that have no sanitation facilities whatsoever. 10. It has been estimated that 75 percent of all surface water in India has been heavily contaminated by human or agricultural waste. 11. Sadly, according to one UN study on sanitation, far more people in India have access to a cell phone than to a toilet. 12. Every 8 seconds, somewhere in the world a child dies from drinking dirty water. 13. Due to a lack of water, Saudi Arabia has given up on trying to grow wheat and will be 100 percent dependent on wheat imports by the year 2016. 14. Each year in northern China, the water table drops by an average of about one meter due to severe drought and overpumping, and the size of the desert increases by an area equivalent to the state of Rhode Island. 15. In China, 80 percent of the major rivers have become so horribly polluted that they do not support any aquatic life at all at this point. So is there any hope that the coming global water crisis can be averted? If not, what can we do to prepare? Please feel free to post a comment with your thoughts below... Be Sociable, Share!

Party Smoke weed. gunslinger1964 Humm if all this water is being pump out of these Aquifer’s than where in the hell is it all going ? lets look at the facts water does not evaporate into space if that was the case, the earth would look something like Mars or one of those very hot dry planets. Tho the natural process these aquifer’s should be filling back up, you pump the water out, you pour it on the ground sewage, gray water or pink water, what ever you want to call it, water is water, it is filtered down tho the dirt and rocks etc, etc and flows back into the aquifer’s. At least that was the base’s that I leaned in school, and it makes logical sense, what goes up (water vapor) has to come back down (rain) so where the hell is all this water going ? There is no ‘water machine’ that is producing “new” water its the same water that was here when the Earth was created, born, hatch, what ever term you want to use. For example if the earth started out with a ZILLION tons of water, than millions of years later that ZILLION tones of water is still here in one form or another ( rain, ice,snow etc ) something sounds REALLY fishy with there explanation of whats going on. I know there are droughts its a natural cycle. but again where is all the water going and why ? !! ← Older Comments « The Dow Hits An All-Time High!

In September, state water regulators mandated that the city cut its water consumption. (Pioneer Press: Scott Takushi) FAIRMONT, Minn. -- On Sept. 10, the dire situation with this southern Minnesota town's water supply rolled in like a dust cloud. Told by state water regulators they had little choice in the matter, the City Council approved emergency water restrictions. Effective immediately, lawns couldn't be watered, cars couldn't be washed and ball fields would be left to brown. Fairmont was drawing nearly four times more water than allowed under state law from the chain of lakes on which the community of fewer than 11,000 lives. In the midst of the drought, the city had to cut its consumption immediately. Fairmont's solution -- to reopen a 1978 well intended only as an emergency backup -- could cost residents hundreds of thousands of dollars more a year in water treatment costs. The city's predicament speaks to the many challenges rural Minnesota residents and state regulators face as they deal with a prolonged drought, a thirst for job-creating growth and the prospect that current water practices in some areas are unsustainable -- yet demand is growing. The situation, especially stark the farther south and west one travels in the state, could preview changes for the Twin Cities metro, from water rationing to taxpayer-funded quests for additional water. Minnesota's water woes are spreading, and the drought, while not the only cause, is shining a spotlight on them. The city of Marshall is venturing 23 miles from town, leapfrogging other communities, to find water. In Worthington, the reservoir designed to replenish its groundwater wells nearly dried up in the fall. Conflicts between well users, while rare, are increasing. Meanwhile, applications to pump groundwater to irrigate crops are rising, reaching record levels. A $9.5 million proposal at the Legislature seeks to roughly double the number of observation wells the Department of Natural Resources has, to about 1,600 across the state. Our water Water was once taken for granted as a resource in Minnesota. Not anymore. For a land of 10,000 lakes, Minnesota's most important water lies beneath. And many believe unchecked usage fueled by growth has compromised its supply to millions of users. Marshall is venturing 23 miles to find water; Worthington's reservoir nearly ran dry; Fairmont has banned watering lawns. Are these rural struggles a harbinger for the Twin Cities? Solutions to the water woes won't be easy or cheap. Shutting off the pumps and relying on the Mississippi River is one option. Another? Be more like Santa Fe. Minnesota, particularly the central part of the state, has been experiencing an irrigation boom. This is one farmer's story. Regulators say the plan will give them a better handle on the long-term health of underground water, which over the past several decades has shifted from a secondary supply to the primary one. Groundwater now accounts for 75 percent of Minnesotans' drinking water, and its use is increasing. But that proposal won't get the state close to the 7,000 observation wells DNR officials say they need unless they get more money -- $3.2 million a year for the next 30 years by one estimate. All those wells are needed, officials say, because in most of the state -- 75 percent -- no one really knows how long the water will flow so freely. COMMUNITIES CHALLENGED Over the decades, communities have built up infrastructures to provide needed water. Fairmont relied on a lake from the dammed Center Creek; Worthington's wells were recharged from a dammed Lake Bella. Now they are dealing with expensive challenges to solve the drought's impact on those resources and to quench a thirst for economic growth for needed jobs in their communities. In 2011, the city of Fairmont broke ground on a $28 million water plant to increase capacity 20 percent. During the permitting process, the DNR realized the city had, for decades, been drawing more water from Budd Lake than allowed. "That's on us, I suppose, for allowing it to go on that long," said Leo Getsfried, a DNR hydrologist based in Mankato. It's coincidence it was spotted during a drought. This old wellhead, dug in 1978 as an emergency backup and taps into the Cretaceous Aquifer, will become an essential part of the water supply for the city of Fairmont. (Pioneer Press: Scott Takushi) But the drought, which helped cause critically low flow levels at the Rapidan Dam, prompted the DNR to tell Fairmont to cut consumption, resulting in water restrictions. And the DNR made it clear Fairmont couldn't get all the water it wanted out of Budd Lake any more. "But we have this new plant, and we want our community to be able to grow," said Troy Nemmers, the city public works director. Accommodating the natural growth of cities and attracting jobs is increasingly a struggle. Worthington turned down an ethanol plant several years ago because the city couldn't handle its water demands. In Marshall, the specter of economic damage from water shortages isn't out of the question.  Its South Marshall and Dudley aquifers are declining and if spring rains don't replenish them, the city will have to implement water restrictions that go beyond watering the grass. Marshall has engaged the area's largest employers, including Schwan's Food Service and Archer Daniels Midland, to plan consumption cuts -- if needed, said Brad Roos, general manager of Marshall Municipal Utilities. "There are two facts of life here in Marshall: We're a wet industry town, and finding water is extremely challenging," Roos said. For 17 years, Marshall has searched for a third source of water, at a cost of millions of dollars. The one officials have settled on is the Sandnes Aquifer, 23 miles outside of town. The cost to build a pipeline to carry that water is $16 million to $18 million, Roos said. The community's annual water budget is $5 million. Fairmont also will need to open its pocketbooks. The city plans to reopen a well to the Cretaceous Aquifer, some 300 feet below ground. The well was drilled in 1978 as an emergency backup. Water from the Cretaceous is extremely hard and will require three times more treatment than Budd Lake water. That will cost the city up to $300,000 more annually, Nemmers said. Worthington's search for water has taken it to two other states. Years ago, the city dammed the Ocheda River where it flowed into Iowa. The resulting Lake Bella serves to recharge the bulk of the city's water supply: seven shallow wells underneath the lake. Large expanses of the lake dried up this fall, and at one point water levels in the wells were dropping a foot per week. Worthington now is buying 25 percent of its water from Iowa, via the Lincoln-Pipestone Rural Water system. "We're buying as much as we can on a daily basis," Worthington Public Utilities General Manager Scott Hain said. The city's long-term hope is to hook into the Lewis & Clark Regional Water System, a decades-old plan to provide water, from wells beneath the Missouri River, for 300,000 people in Minnesota, Iowa and South Dakota. The $462 million Lewis & Clark project has yet to extend to Worthington and is behind schedule. CONFLICTS AND CONSERVATION As the ground is punctured with more straws to suck out more water, water conflicts will continue to rise, said the DNR's Sehl. Since 2005, the DNR has verified two dozen examples of private wells being sucked dry by deeper, high-volume wells, often from industrial users like ethanol plants, which use large amounts of water. Last year, a dozen so-called "well-interference complaints" were filed. While that's a small number, Sehl notes it's the most in recent memory. And he believes other cases don't go reported. The ethanol boom appears to be over, but the boom in crop irrigation -- once a rarity in Minnesota -- is just getting started. Between 2000 and 2006, the DNR issued around 50 or fewer crop watering permits a year. Last year, 200 permits were issued. Farm irrigation is now the second largest consumer of groundwater, behind drinking water. Fairmont, Worthington and Marshall all have conservation policies, ranging from limiting lawn-watering to rebating residents who install low-flow showers and toilets. In each city, residential per capita water use is either holding steady or declining, but each city's total demand is increasing as each community grows. Officials from each city said they know they might have to increase pressure for conservation if the aquifers don't begin to refill. "It's going to be quite an interesting summer," said Nemmers, Fairmont's public works director. Everyone contacted for this report -- hydrologists, farmers, well-drillers, city officials -- said they were aware that weather patterns have changed in recent years across much of Minnesota. The climate is seeing longer periods without rain and heavier rain when it does fall, leading to more runoff and less groundwater infiltration. And they all said they're aware that many climate prediction models call for that trend to continue. Since the 1800s, the Beemer family has drawn its livelihood drawing water from the ground of southern Minnesota. But Beemer Companies owner Pat Beemer said he believes our practices might be unsustainable. "I think we're missing the boat on conservation," Beemer said. "All of a sudden a drought comes along and we need more water for irrigation and everything else and we have less of it. And we wonder where it went. ... We can't keep acting that way."

(AP Photo/ Rajesh Kumar Singh) Get Impact Newsletters: Subscribe Follow:  Video, Water, Water, sponsor_clean-Water, Toilets, water, Water Education, Water Sanitation, Water Women, Water, World Water Day 2013, Impact News The global water crisis isn't just about simple supply and demand -- it's an issue related to women's rights, global development and preventable deaths. As the world population swells to over 7 billion people, and the demand for fresh water continues to grow with it, global leaders have called for greater innovation, advocacy and solutions, which is why this year’s World Water Day has been dedicated to the theme of “cooperation.” UN Deputy Chief Jan Eliasson said improving access to water would reduce maternal health issues, child mortality and overall poverty, the AP reported. "If we do water and sanitation right, we can have a great improvement on other goals," he said. As climate change and political and social unrest take their toll on fresh water supplies, 783 million people lack access to clean or safe water and 37 percent of the world's population doesn't have access to sanitation facilities, a fact that the UN points to as a further inequity. "Access to sanitation facilities around the world, more than any other service, provides a window into the vast difference between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots." Catarina de Albuquerque, UN Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, said in a press release. Read on to find out how the water crisis affects women, children, education, health and hunger -- and what's being done about it. THE WATER CRISIS IS A WOMEN'S ISSUE In Africa alone, women and children spend 40 billion hours annually collecting water. While taking on this backbreaking effort, they're also subjected to harassment and sexual assault along the way in unprotected areas. THE WATER CRISIS IS A HUNGER ISSUE Water scarcity could cause major food shortages in the foreseeable future, experts have warned. Earlier this year, Nestle CEO Paul Bulcke said we're using more than our sustainable supply and that this overuse of fresh water is a serious risk, The Guardian reported: "It is anticipated that there will be up to 30 percent shortfalls in global cereal production by 2030 due to water scarcity," he said. "This is a loss equivalent to the entire grain crops of India and the United States combined." THE WATER CRISIS IS A CHILD MORTALITY ISSUE Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of kids globally -- an issue that is completely preventable. Lack of clean water is the primary reason why more than 3,000 children under 5 years of age die every day from diarrhea and other water-related illnesses, the UN reports. THE WATER CRISIS IS A SANITATION ISSUE One in three people don't have a toilet, the UN reports. What's more, infrastructure issues are lagging in progress. “Access to sanitation currently ranks as the most-off track of the Millennium Goals, and one that will obviously not be met by 2015,” Catarina de Albuquerque, UN Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, said in a press release. THE WATER CRISIS IS AN EDUCATION ISSUE Menstruation should just be an inconvenience, not a reason to miss 10 to 20 percent of the school year. But for girls who go to schools that don't have gender-specific bathroom facilities, that's the unfortunate reality. Building sanitary latrines allows girls to go to school when they have their periods, without worrying about hygiene issues and continue to increase literacy rates for young females in developing countries.

Mark Dayton is proposing an increase in state water fees that would raise millions of dollars to help the Department of Natural Resources analyze groundwater supplies at a time when the Land of 10,000 Lakes faces potential water shortages. Water use has risen sharply in recent years, driven by urban use as well as rural industry and irrigation, and state officials say they haven’t had the money to analyze how the activity is affecting thousands of underground aquifers that are critical to the state’s water supply. Some systems they have studied over time have seen levels dropping year after year in trends that are unsustainable. The higher permitting fees would increase costs for municipal suppliers, farmers and industries. For the average homeowner, the annual water bill could go up as much $1, according to state estimates, while the average farm would see its permit fee rise from $140 a year to about $500. About 75 percent of Minnesotans rely on groundwater systems for their drinking water, and groundwater accounts for about 17 percent of the 1.3 trillion gallons of water used each year in the state. “Considering how important these groundwater supplies are for our economy, our future economy, our ecosystems, we think we have to get on top of this issue and make sure that we’re making informed choices,” said Jason Moeckel, the DNR manager who oversees the water inventory and analysis unit. The plan, if it passes the Legislature, would more than double the amount generated by fees each year that go to DNR’s water management programs. Currently fees generate about $5 million a year for the programs and would increase to $11.8 million within two years. The extra funds would allow state hydrogeologists to place additional monitors to track underground water levels. Understanding the state’s water supply is essential because the DNR is in charge of permitting usage, said Kris Sigford, water quality program director with the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. “We have a lot of water, but we do have local shortages and we are projected to have more of them,” she said. Last year, White Bear Lake sued the DNR over the lake’s diminished water level, blaming it on agency approval that allowed surrounding communities to draw more water from the aquifer below the lake. The lake that supplies the city of Fairmont with water dropped to such low levels last fall that city officials eliminated nonessential use. In Worthington, the city’s water supply was so low that wells were nearly going dry. Moeckel said aquifers are also important to the health of lakes, rivers and streams across the state. He said these systems will be under increased pressure as the state is expected to add 1 million new people over roughly the next two decades. “There are clearly places in the U.S. experiencing very severe water shortages, places where streams don’t flow anymore,” Moeckel said. “We need to get in front of this issue.” Brad Schrade • 612-673-4777 more from local Allegiant further cuts Minn. presence, ending flights between Duluth and Phoenix Wisconsin court upholds cellphone tracking cases Ponders release picture of newborn girl '); } get related content delivered to your inbox You are now subscribed.   Morning Update Afternoon Update North Metro Update South Metro Update West Metro Update manage my email subscriptions resize text print buy reprints Tweet from the homepage Israeli tank shells hit UN school in Gaza, killing 15 Scoggins: Vikings should address the mess they let fester Site of racial showdown in Mpls. is heading to National Register ADVERTISEMENT Most read Most Emailed Most Watched $600 million solutions on table for thirsty White Bear Lake Woman on motor scooter dies in crash with car near Como pavilion Pickup bursts into flames on Hwy. 169, halts NW. metro traffic for miles Vikings won't enhance stadium to protect migrating birds Site of racial showdown in Mpls. is heading to National Register Pickup driver dies west of Twin Cities after rear-ending a slowing semi State park worker picking up trash gets lost, is found in middle of night Shot, slain Somali star had ties to Minnesota Site of racial showdown in Mpls. is heading to National Register $600 million solutions on table for thirsty White Bear Lake Woman on motor scooter dies in crash with car near Como pavilion Pickup bursts into flames on Hwy. 169, halts NW. metro traffic for miles Nine BWCA campers rescued following late-night storms Steve McDaniels to buy Nissan franchise in Bloomington State park worker picking up trash gets lost, is found in middle of night Thursday's Wabasha Street Block Party is fete with a purpose Vikings tickets go on sale, but Cordarrelle Patterson gives them away free Rand: Moving a few steps forward in the Kevin Love trade marathon What to expect at Vikings training camp Twins' Dozier hits 19th home run in loss Soccer-golf hybrid exploding in popularity More Video ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT question of the day Poll: Grade the All-Star Game experience Weekly Question Excellent Very good Fair Poor View results ADVERTISEMENT inside the StarTribune news graphics Interactive map: Finding best gas prices in metro local As honeybees disappear, are your favorite foods next? jobs 2014 Minnesota Top Workplaces entertainment Download our summer e-book thriller, ‘Savage Minnesota’! entertainment Soundcheck: Minnesota musicians up close lifestyle Best of Minnesota 2014: Food, drink, getaways, design and more Global Search News Local Sports Business Politics Opinion Lifestyle Entertainment Obituaries Classifieds Autos Housing Jobs 425 Portland Av.
