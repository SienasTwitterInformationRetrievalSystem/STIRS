Lowell Thomas Travel Journalism Competition 150 things to love about Kansas Nazis' Ukraine HQ to become a museum; Hitler tour in Germany draws criticism U.S. starts evacuations as Egypt unrest spreads By Laura Bly, USA TODAY Updated Comments The U.S. State Department says it will evacuate about 1,200 Americans from Egypt today, and another 1,000 on Tuesday - a reflection of escalating concern surrounding week-long protests against the government of President Hosni Mubarak. According to the Associated Press, a U.S. military plane landed at Larnaca Airport in Cyprus on Monday afternoon ferrying 42 U.S. Embassy officials and their dependents from Egypt. The U.S. Embassy in Nicosia said at least one more plane was expected Monday with about 180 people — most of them U.S. citizens. Two more flights, carrying about 177 passengers each, left Cairo for Athens, says the New York Times. At Cairo's airport, the AP reports, shouting matches and fist-fights broke out among passengers cramming into Terminal 3 seeking flights home. "In an attempt to reduce tensions, the airport's departures board stopped announcing flight times — but the move simply fueled anger over canceled or delayed flights," the AP said. "Making matters worse, check-in counters were poorly staffed because many EgyptAir employees had been unable to get to work due to a 3 p.m. to 8 a.m. curfew and traffic breakdowns across the Egyptian capital." An updated travel warning, issued Sunday, urges Americans to leave "as soon as they can safely do so." It notes that while demonstrations in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities have not been directed against Westerners, Americans should stay in their hotels or homes until the situation stabilizes. Many airlines - including EgyptAir and Delta, which fly between New York and Cairo - have curtailed or suspended Cairo flights indefinitely. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo said it would offer voluntary evacuations to "safehaven locations in Europe" - including Istanbul, Athens, and Nicosia, Cyprus - starting today. The embassy's Twitter feed said Americans wishing to leave Egypt on evacuation flights should go to the Cairo airport after 11 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) and "prepare for a substantial wait" with their own food, water and necessary toiletries. The government warned that priority would be given to people with serious medical conditions. More than 2,400 citizens have contacted the embassy requesting evacuation assistance, the Twitter feed said. In a press briefing Sunday afternoon, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Janice L. Jacobs urged Americans with existing commercial airline reservations to contact their carrier first, but added that the U.S. government would provide charters from Cairo and other Egyptian locations as needed. Passengers will have to reimburse the cost of the flights and make their own onward travel plans. Jacobs said the evacuation flights could involve "several thousand" of an estimated 52,000 Americans in Egypt. She said would-be evacuees should contact the embassy by e-mail at EgyptEmergencyUSC@state.gov or by calling 202-501-4444. While a lack of Internet service in Egypt has been a "huge challenge," she added, the State Department planned to use "all available media" - along with contact from travelers' relatives and friends in the U.S. - to provide updates on flights. RELATED: Tourists besiege Cairo airport, but flights halt RELATED:  Cruise lines cancel calls in Egypt as unrest grows Would-be looters broke into Cairo's Egyptian Museum on Saturday, ripping the heads off two mummies and damaging about 10 small artifacts before being caught and detained by soldiers, the Associated Press reports. Fears that looters could target ancient treasures at sites across the country prompted the military to dispatch armored personnel carriers and troops to the Pyramids of Giza, the temple city of Luxor and other key archaeological monuments. Earlier, the British goverment said the country's tightly guarded Red Sea diving resorts along the Sinai coast - the most popular destination for British tourists - remained calm. But in Sharm el-Sheikh, a BBC reporter says he returned from dinner Sunday to find his hotel barricaded and the mood of the resort dramatically changed. Along the Nile River in Luxor, meanwhile, tourists were being told to stay on cruise boats "as a precautionary measure," says Pamela Lassers of Abercrombie & Kent, a tour company that operates three Nile River boats. Between 100 and 300 A&K clients, most of them American, are still in Egypt, but the company is trying to arrange flights out of the country and has canceled all tours and cruises there through Feb. 28, says Lassers. Future travelers are being offered refunds or alternative itineraries, but "Egypt is a once-in-a-lifetime destination, and most want to wait until the situation settles down," she says. About 350,000 Americans visited Egypt in 2010, and the country has been "one of our most popular destinations," Lassers adds. Tourism accounts for 11% of gross domestic product and about one in eight jobs in Egypt, and the industry has rebounded from previous unrest and terrorist attacks. When gunmen killed 58 tourists and four Egyptians at an ancient temple in Luxor in 1997, tourism slumped but picked up fairly quickly. The September 11, 2001 attacks, the second Palestinian Intifada, and a series of bomb attacks on tourist resorts in Sinai from 2004 to 2006 all led to temporary decreases in tourist arrivals, Reuters reports, but the trend over the last decade has been broadly upward. 150 things to love about Kansas Nazis' Ukraine HQ to become a museum; Hitler tour in Germany draws criticism Comment Most Popular HF Test Spirit's $100 carry-on bag fee just the tip...

Sisi - in 60 secs Watch 'One-horse race' The US and Canada are among a number of governments evacuating citizens from Egypt amid continuing unrest. The US and Canada said chartered flights had begun leaving for "safe havens" in Europe and Turkey on Monday. The US said it had evacuated more than 1,200 Americans and expected to fly out 1,400 more in the coming days. Tens of thousands of people protested in Cairo for a seventh day, defying the start of a new curfew and calling for a general strike. Both the US and Canada said evacuated citizens would be asked to reimburse them for the cost of the flights and would have to make their own arrangements to return home from airports in Cyprus, Germany, Greece, London and Paris. In Washington DC on Monday, US state department spokesman PJ Crowley told reporters that by the end of the day it would have despatched nine flights ferrying US citizens from the country. Continue reading the main story “Start Quote The government of Canada's priority is the safety of Canadian citizens in Egypt” End Quote Lawrence Cannon Canadian foreign minister In the next few days the US expected to fly citizens from the cities of Aswan and Luxor, he said. The first flight carrying Canadians out of the country left on Monday after it was delayed when airport officials demanded a total of 2,000 Canadian dollars (US $1,996; £1,244) from passengers before allowing the plane to leave, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported. The Canadian foreign affairs ministry said the fee was charged for luggage, the CBC reported. As of Monday morning, the Canadian foreign ministry said it was investigating ways to evacuate citizens from cities other than Cairo, the centre of unrest. "Individuals located outside of Cairo are advised not to try to make their way to Cairo, for safety reasons," Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon said in a statement. "The government of Canada's priority is the safety of Canadian citizens in Egypt." In London, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt told MPs that most Britons who wanted to leave Egypt had managed to depart, but that about 30 would have to spend a night at Cairo airport before boarding flights. Danish shipping line AP Moller-Maersk sent a plane to evacuate relatives of its Danish employees, and Air France cancelled its daily flight to Cairo but planned to add extra capacity out of Egypt, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported. China sent two planes to Egypt on Monday to evacuate its own citizens, Chinese state media reported. The aircraft would return on Tuesday if ground operations at Cairo's airport were functioning smoothly, a spokesman said, according to Xinhua news agency. Indonesia ordered its roughly 6,000 citizens to evacuate the country and promised to send military aircraft to bring them home, AFP news agency reported. Japan and Thailand also said they were sending planes to repatriate tourists. But Thai Airways warned poor working conditions at the airport, affecting operations including refuelling and plane servicing, could hinder the effort. Airport 'a zoo' Meanwhile, Cairo's international airport was a scene of chaos on Monday, as thousands of foreign nationals sought to leave the country. AP reported would-be travellers getting into shouting matches and even fist-fights. Airline counters were understaffed, with many personnel unable to reach work amid curfews and traffic congestion in the Egyptian capital. "It's an absolute zoo, what a mess," Justine Khanzadian, a 23-year-old graduate student from the American University of Cairo, told AP. "I decided to leave because of the protests, the government here is just not stable enough to stay."

Local U.S. World Business Sports Entertainment Health Style Travel Opinion Babylon & Beyond Observations from Iraq, Iran, Israel, the Arab world and beyond « Previous Post | Babylon & Beyond Home | Next Post » EGYPT: U.S. Embassy to begin voluntary evacuation flights Monday January 30, 2011 |  1:44 pm The U.S. Embassy in Cairo plans to begin flying Americans out of Egypt on chartered planes Monday, according to a Sunday statement. The announcement came hours after the embassy advised Americans in Egypt to consider leaving as soon as possible. The statement said the State Department is making arrangements to provide those who want to leave with flights to “safe-haven locations in Europe.” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Janice Jacobs told CNN that the government-chartered flights will continue after Monday. “They will be ongoing until we are able to get all Americans who are not able to get out via commercial airlines,” Jacobs said. She advised Americans to limit travel in Egypt and urged those with relatives in Egypt to convey flight information to them directly, since access to the department's website is limited within Egypt. The department earlier moved to reduce diplomatic staff in Egypt, authorizing the voluntary departure of diplomats and nonessential workers. Britain recommended its citizens leave Cairo, Suez and Alexandria, “where it is safe to do so.” An accountant at the Azerbaijani Embassy in Egypt was among those killed in street clashes in Cairo on Saturday on his way home from work, an Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters. The spokesman said the government was sending a plane to Cairo on Sunday to pick up the body and evacuate about 70 Azerbaijanis studying in Egypt. The Japanese government was preparing Sunday to use chartered planes to fly out 600 Japanese nationals stranded in or around Cairo, the Kyodo news agency reported. The Greek foreign ministry told Reuters that at least two Greek military aircraft were on standby to evacuate citizens from Egypt. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki dispatched his presidential plane to Egypt to pick up Iraqi citizens, and the Iraqi transport ministry ordered free transportation on Iraqi Airways for Iraqi citizens leaving Egypt, a ministry spokesman told Reuters. The Belgian travel agency Jetair, owned by TUI Travel, said on its website that it was working on an evacuation plan that would begin Monday for customers who are in Egypt. Belgian media said about 1,700 tourists were subject to the plan. Turkey also offered to evacuate citizens wanting to leave Egypt on Sunday. As some European companies started evacuating staff Sunday, Reuters reported that the scene at Cairo Airport had become chaotic as travelers competed for a dwindling number of flights. U.S.-based Delta Air Lines told Reuters that as of Friday it was suspending service into Cairo indefinitely, but other major airlines, including Lufthansa and Air India, said they would send additional planes to Cairo and Alexandria. At the same time many were preparing to flee the country, others were sheltering in place or pursuing holiday travel. The Philippines foreign ministry readied a $567,000 emergency fund for the evacuation of about 6,600 Filipinos on Sunday, while Thailand advised some 2,600 Thais in the country to stay put, Reuters reported. “They have been asked to stay indoors with food and water in case of an emergency,” Thai ministry spokesman Thani Thongpakdi told Reuters. Most of the estimated 40,000 Russians vacationing in Egypt have no plans to cut short their trips despite the protests, the acting head of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency, Alexander Radkov, told the Interfax news agency on Saturday. “On the whole, the situation in Egyptian resorts remains calm. ... People do not want to interrupt their holiday,” he said. Tour operator TUI Deutschland said cancellations and rebookings of trips to the Red Sea coast had so far not increased, and Thomas Cook flew a fresh batch of tourists to the region from Germany on Sunday. “Our guests are doing fine. And none of them have said they want to come home now,” a Thomas Cook spokeswoman told Reuters.

A curfew is currently in effect throughout Egypt from 5pm until 7am in the morning. I'm ready to go. What do I do? If you wish to depart Egypt you should proceed to your local airport and secure commercial passage out of the country. If there is a U.S. Government evacuation flight on Saturday, proceed to Terminal 1, Hall 4 (Hajj Hall) as soon as possible on Saturday, February 5. Do not wait for a call from the U.S. Embassy. Further delay is not advisable. Where is the flight on Saturday going? At this time, we do not have confirmation of the potential U.S. evacuation flight's destination. Similar to previous flights, however, it will be to a European safe haven location and we will offer repatriation loans for any U.S. citizen seeking assistance. Are there plans for any charter flights from Alexandria? We have no information about future charter flights from Alexandria. We highly recommend that U.S. citizens seeking to depart Egypt do so now either by commercial airline or via Saturday's charter flight from Cairo. Do I need to prove I completed military service to board a plane? Male Egyptians and Egyptian-dual nationals must present a military service exemption certificate before they will be permitted to depart Egypt. Male Egyptians and Egyptian-dual nationals staying in Egypt for more than six months from the date of arrival, and who have not completed military service, are not generally required to enlist in the armed forces. Exemption certificates are available through the Ministry of Defense Draft Office. I wish to travel by commercial air carrier - how do I book a flight? While some flights are still disrupted, major airlines are still operating out of Egyptian airports. Please contact your airline or travel agent to book a ticket prior to heading to the airport. If you already have an existing ticket or reservation please contact your airline to confirm your flight status. My child is a U.S. citizen. Can my whole family be evacuated? A U.S. citizen child may be escorted by one adult, preferably a parent, who has appropriate travel documents. If a family has more than one U.S. citizen child, the one-adult rule still applies. Do I need a U.S. passport? All U.S. citizen travelers and their spouses and children are required to have valid travel documents. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo will assist U.S. citizens with travel documents. U.S. citizens who do not hold a valid U.S. passport and are interested in departing Egypt via USG-chartered transportation should contact the U.S. Department of State and Embassy Cairo by sending an email to EgyptEmergencyUSC@state.gov or by calling 1-202-501-4444. What do I do if my child is a U.S. citizen, but hasn't yet been documented? Contact the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. U.S. citizens who do not hold a valid U.S. passport interested in departing Egypt via USG-chartered transportation should contact the U.S. Department of State and Embassy Cairo by sending an email to EgyptEmergencyUSC@state.gov or by calling 1-202-501-4444. My family members aren't U.S. citizens. Can they travel with me? Evacuation flights will transport U.S. citizens and their immediate family members. Immediate family members - defined as spouses and children who are not U.S. citizens - will be required to have travel documentation that will permit their entry into the safe haven destinations. At this time, flights are expected to travel to Istanbul, Turkey; Athens, Greece; and Nicosia, Cyprus. Safe haven destinations may change. U.S. citizens requesting evacuation will not be able to select their safe haven destinations. NOTE: Non-U.S. citizens accompanying evacuated U.S. citizens to safe haven locations have been able to apply for an airport entrance visa on arrival to the safe have location. Non-U.S. citizens planning onward travel not already holding visas or Legal Permanent Residency Status for entry into the United States will need to visit the U.S. Embassy in the safe haven location to apply for a visa prior to scheduling onward travel. Will you fly me to the United States? No. Our goal is to get people to a safe place, where they can make their own onward travel arrangements. Travelers will be responsible for their own onward travel arrangements and accommodations in the safe haven city. Consular officers will provide travelers with information on airlines and hotels. Non-U.S. citizens planning onward travel to the U.S. who do not already hold U.S. visas or Legal Permanent Residency Status will need to visit the U.S. Embassy in the safe haven location to apply for a visa prior to scheduling onward travel. How do I get a visa (to safe haven country or the United States)? Non-U.S. citizens accompanying evacuated U.S. citizens to safe haven locations have been able to apply for an airport entrance visa on arrival to the safe have location. Non-U.S. citizens planning onward travel not already holding visas or Legal Permanent Residency Status for entry into the United States will need to visit the U.S. Embassy in the safe haven location to apply for a visa prior to scheduling onward travel. What should I bring? Travelers should bring valid travel documents and any necessary medications. Each traveler may bring one suitcase (not more than 44lbs) and a small personal carry-on item. U.S. citizens seeking evacuation should be prepared for a substantial wait at the airport. Travelers are advised to bring food, water, diapers and other necessary toiletries with them to the airport. What about my pets? U.S. Government evacuation flights cannot accommodate pets. Some commercial airlines do offer pet transport. Please check with the airlines directly. Do I have to pay for the flight? U.S. citizens requesting evacuation are required to sign paperwork promising to reimburse the U.S. Government for flight costs at a later date. Exact flight costs are not yet available, but will be comparable to the cost of a one-way commercial flight from Egypt to the safe haven location on the same date. The Department of State will contact evacuees with reimbursement instructions, including the possibility of a repayment schedule. How do I get to the airport? At this time, public transport to include taxis is still operating in Egypt. Print Email This site is managed by the U.S. Department of State.

The announcement came one week after Egyptians began protesting President Hosni Mubarak’s 30 years in power, and his refusal to step down immediately. At first the protests were peaceful, but news reports say pro-Mubarak forces have hit the streets terrorizing journalists and anti-government civilians. On Monday, the State Department evacuated 1,200 American citizens and a total of 2,000 up until today. About 3,000 all together have registered for evacuation flights. However, the cost of evacuation is not cheap. The U.S. citizens who elect to evacuate via an American USG chartered flight are taken to one of four safe haven locations in Europe, where they must fund their own trip home. In addition, citizens who request evacuation are asked to sign paperwork promising to reimburse the U.S. government at a later date, according to the Bureau of Consular Affairs. Exact flight costs are not yet available, but should be comparable to a one-way commercial flight from Egypt to the safe haven location, as listed on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. The safe haven locations are Larnaca, Cyprus; Istanbul; Frankfurt, Germany; and, Athens, Greece. Devon Youngblood, a 22-year-old American contacted through Facebook and working at an art gallery in Egypt, said she decided to leave. “There are many of us who feel a connection to Egypt, but are having difficulty coping with the rising violence in a country that has been so safe in the past,” she said. “I am one of the Americans that chose to leave temporarily, but I know of people who consider it their home and are debating whether or not they are ready to evacuate, even with their fears of safety.” Youngblood is among the estimated 52,000 Americans living in Egypt who experienced the political turmoil terrorizing the nation. Many people are taking to Facebook, Twitter and other media, describing the conditions in the airport as cramped and aggressive. There have been a limited number of seats available on departing flights so far, leaving out pets and saddling passengers with only one piece of luggage per person. The State Department announced Wednesday on Twitter that “additional U.S. government flights after Thursday are unlikely.” There were no other viable options available for American citizens other than the chartered flights. Egypt’s national carrier, EgyptAir, suspended all flights to and from the country, as did Delta Air Lines, the only U.S. carrier that travels directly into Egypt. Now State reports that citizens have been leaving via commercial airlines, private flights and charter flights from other governments.  ©2001 - 2014 Medill Reports - Chicago, Northwestern University.  A publication of the Medill School.

The department said more than 220 have already left on the special flights, including 50-100 who got on a military plane that was already in Egypt and had available seats. More flights are scheduled. The department said it expects to evacuate about 900 U.S. citizens from Egypt on Monday and another 1,000 on Tuesday. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Amid the chaos at the airport, the department warned those wishing to take the flights from Cairo to Cyprus, Greece or Turkey that they should prepare for lengthy waits at the airport and they should bring food, water and other necessities. The department said the majority of U.S. citizens wanting to leave are in Cairo but that others are in the cities of Alexandria, Luxor and Aswan. Assistant Secretary of State Janice Jacobs told reporters Sunday that she expects it will take several flights over the coming days to handle the number of Americans who want to leave Egypt, where rioters are threatening to overturn the ruling regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Jacobs acknowledged that Internet interruptions in Egypt are making it difficult for Americans there to get information about the evacuations. But she said they have been able to get information from people in the United States who do have access to State Department and embassy websites. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton appealed for an orderly transition to lasting democracy in Egypt even as escalating violence threatened Mideast stability. She refused to speculate on Mubarak's future and his teetering government, but said U.S. officials "obviously want to see people who are truly committed to democracy, not to imposing any ideology on Egyptians." She warned Sunday against a takeover resembling the one in Iran, with a "small group that doesn't represent the full diversity of Egyptian society" seizing control and imposing its ideological beliefs. Though the U.S. military is closely watching developments, the Defense Department has not been asked to involve itself in the State Department's evacuation plan, Marine Col. Dave Lapan, a Defense Department spokesman, said Monday. The Pentagon is taking stock of what ships, planes and other assets it has nearby that could be used if the State Department asks the military for help. The Navy, for example, has aircraft carriers in the Middle East region. The USS Enterprise is in the Mediterranean Sea after a port visit to Portugal and the USS Abraham Lincoln is in the Arabian Sea in support of the war in Afghanistan. Involvement by the military could presumably change if the threat to Americans in Egypt were to become too great and if it becomes impossible for citizens to get out of the country commercially. Jacobs said the U.S. will have enough flights to take out all American citizens and dependents who want to leave. And the U.S. may also send charter planes to other cities in Egypt, such as Luxor, if there are a number of Americans stranded there. She said Americans with tickets on commercial airlines should first contact those carriers about getting out. According to the State Department there are about 52,000 Americans registered with the embassy in Cairo. Officials noted, however, that many people don't register -- or deregister when they leave -- and some Americans may not want to leave.
