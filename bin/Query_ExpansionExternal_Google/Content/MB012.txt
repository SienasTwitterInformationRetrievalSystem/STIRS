By  IBTimes Staff Reporter@ibtimes on January 31 2011 9:06 AM Wikileaks cannot afford to continue publishing, according to Assange REUTERS Quoting observers of the Nobel Prize, an international news agency has reported that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange may be one among the nominated personalities  this year. With the logic that news events often influence the nominations, the observers speculate that the 2011 candidates for the prestigious prize could be the Arab protestors, Russian Human Rights activists and the whistleblower Assange.Assange, the man behind the whistleblower website WikiLeaks which has exposed several secrets and truths that the authorities want to keep secret, has emerged as a hero to many across the globe. However, not all are in support of Assange winning the Nobel. To claim that his actions have in some way promoted 'fraternity among nations,' to invoke the famous line in Alfred Nobel's will, would be far-fetched, if not altogether inaccurate, US journalist and Nobel Peace Prize specialist Scott London told the news agency, AFP.Support on FacebookNevertheless, Assange's army of worldwide worshippers and their arguments can not be discounted as well.  In fact there are a couple of Facebook communities dedicated to Julian Assange for Nobel Peace Prize. The views expressed on social networking site are varied and the arguments supporting Assange are passionate. In one interesting thread on 'How YOU can help Julian Assange/WikiLeaks get nominated',  many said that the reputation of the Nobel Prize has been scarred citing several controversial instances from the histroy. I don't mean to be a fly in the ointment, particularly as I support Mr Assange, but is the Nobel Peace prize not utterly discredited since they awarded it to a head of state who was, at the time, engaged in two separate colonial wars, and was in the process of beefing up the numbers of troops sent to one of those war zones, at the time of his nomination? I'm referring to ... Obama and the Iraq and Afgan wars, commented one user, Colin. Nobel Prize Rules The names of the nominees have always been kept secret. However those entitled to nominate candidates are allowed to reveal their pick. Members of parliament worldwide, government across the globe, previous laureates and university professors are among the groups of people who are eligible to make nominations. The Norwegian Nobel Committee will only consider candidate proposals sent by February 1 every year. The winner will be announced in October.

Tweet Buffer Wikileaks founder Julian Assange could be among this year’s Nobel Peace Prize nominees, experts say. Julian Assange, Norway, March 2010 Photo: Espen Moe/Wikimedia Commons The Norwegian Nobel Committee is having its first meeting of the year today to consider candidates, and will announce the final nominees in October. Usually, news events have a great influence on the nominations, meaning Russian human rights activists, as well as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange might be listed for the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, reports AFP. Kristian Berg-Harpviken, director for the Peace Research Institute Oslo, tells The Foreigner “he is pretty sure Mr. Assange will be nominated, but that he will not receive the prize.” “He is too controversial, and the Wikileaks release has raised serious questions about the data security issue, as well as the availability of potentially-harmful information”, he says. According to Nobel expert and historian Asle Sveen, also believes it unlikely Mr. Assange will be given the prize because of what allegedly happened in Sweden. He faces possible extradition to answer allegations of rape and sexual molestation. Moreover, US journalist and Nobel Peace Prize specialist Scott London tells AFP that “claiming Assange’s actions of having in some way promoted ‘fraternity among nations’, to invoke the famous line in Alfred Nobel’s will, would be far-fetched, if not altogether inaccurate”. This year’s list of nominees might also be influenced by the waves of protests against authoritarian Arab regimes, including those in Tunisia and Egypt. “That’s a possibility, but no name really stands out. In Egypt, the (opposition) movement seems very spontaneous. And (the most visible opposition leader) Mohamed ElBaradei already received a Nobel Prize”, says Asle Sveen. Nobel Committee members will be able to start adding to the nominations list from 28th February. Mr. Sveen believes two women candidates among last year’s favourites, Svetlana Gannushkina, the Russian human activist who is also looking after Maria Amelie, and Sima Samar from Afghanistan, are likely to be on the list this year again. “It has been a long time since the Nobel was given to a woman and giving it to Sima Samar would have the additional benefit of raising the issue of women in Muslim countries”, he says.

FAIR Blog The national media watch group Home About FAIR Blog Counterspin Extra! FAIR TV Take Action Store Contact FAIR BLOG Jan 31 2011 Julian Assange, Conspiracy Theorist By Peter Hart 37 Comments The long 60 Minutes segment on WikiLeaks and Julian Assange from last night (1/30/11) is definitely worth a look. But this set-up from correspondent Steve Kroft was certainly odd: Julian Assange is not your average journalist or publisher, and some have argued that he is not really a journalist at all. He is an anti-establishment ideologue with conspiratorial views. He believes large government institutions use secrecy to suppress the truth and he distrusts the mainstream media for playing along. Assange believes the government keeps important secrets? And that mainstream media play along? That is kooky.

Sarah Palin calling to our organization to be dealt with like the Taliban, and be hunted down. There\'s calls either for my assassination or the assassination of my staff or for us to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed." Kroft: "Well as you know, we have a First Amendment and people can say whatever they want, including politicians. I don\'t think that many people in the United States took seriously the idea that you were a terrorist." When people talk about being threatened with death, one doesn't usually respond by pointing to the First Amendment–because death threats are not protected by the First Amendment. And people don't take what Biden and Palin say seriously? Why is every Facebook post by Palin treated as news, then?

Assange stood his ground admirably but my question is why should he have to defend himself OR freedom of the press before THE PRESS? The character assassination of Assange has got to stop. Assange's natural innate dignity speaks well for him, thank GOD, because he sure doesn't get any support from the MSM. Are you listening MSM? If the DOJ succeeds in prosecuting Assange it bodes ill for freedom of the press (and the Constitution) in this country which is probably now down below 24th in the world for freedom of the press, and YOU ARE NEXT. You should be standing up for Assange all guns blazing MSM, but no, you seem just a bunch of wussy cowards who won't stand up for the first Amendment to the Constitution either. Matt Powers View February 1, 2011 I just wanted to repeat that last sentence in the quote… "he distrusts the mainstream media for playing along." Am I the only who noticed a guilty conscience in how that was phrased right there? Seth Miller View February 1, 2011 Here\'s what Assange COULD have said about being a ÃƒÆ’Â¢ÃƒÂ¢”Å¡Â¬Ãƒâ€¦“subversiveÃƒÆ’Â¢ÃƒÂ¢”Å¡Â¬Ãƒâ€šÂ: http://www.spiritalchemy.com/blog/rethinking-subversion mark winget View February 3, 2011 I am an American citizen who believes, as do many Americans, that our government has evolved into a savagely corrupt, moraly devoid, greed motivated monster that has wonderd too far from what our founding fathers designed. I work at a truck stop and have the opportunity to speak with many people from all over the country. Many of them have voiced,"what happened to my america? It's gone. Or, " this is not the America I grew up with. I have even heard from several that they think It's about time for an American "revolution." They are fed up with the "stupidity" of our law makers and constant regulations forced upon them. But the conversations usually end with a statement like, "something needs to be done to change how laws are passed without the people having the opportunity to vote on it. But everone is so bussy trying to earn a living that no one has the time to engage in a long time consuming effort to bring about change. So I say to Mr. Assange atta boy we the people need you and more like you. I see you as a world patriot !!!! Keep up the good fight and don't let the basterds get away with anything. keep safe. You're a HERO in my eyes and many many Americans agree with me. Fred Jakobcic View February 4, 2011 The mainstream media, as shown on 60 Minutes, and elsewhere it incapeable and truth or integrity in its reports and honesty in its reportsing, as this interview with Julian Assange is a glaring example of that. Why bother with journalism schools when their is no real journalims in the mainstream. You can find it elsewhere, but elsewhere does not have the resources to get the new out to as many. This lacking shows the failure in the mainstream, the slanting of stories and censorship by omission or outright failure to report. These people ought to be ashamed to call themselves reporters or journalist, but that is the kind neoconservatives, not reality. McMike View February 4, 2011 Apparently it is necessary to point out that what Assange did is exactly what the MSM does (or rather is supposed to do when it does its job) which is to publish leaked information and expose government lies and cover-ups. The entire idea of journalism is predicated on that supposed conspiracy theory: that governments keep secrets and lie. The show 60 minutes in particular, as they chase people around with cameras and accuse them of lying. If governments did not lie and keep secrets, we would not need journalism. This whole framing that somehow Assange is different from the media is false, as if he exists in some vastly different qualitative category than journalism. He is not doing free speech, these are not merely his views and opinions; he is doing journalism. It is my understanding the he performs a certain amount of due diligence before he publishes information, he gives people a chance to vet and reply in advance. What is different about him is that he does not ask his sources' permission to publish, or grant them anonymity in exchange for access. He does what journalists are supposed to do, and for that the MSM loathes him. OPEN YOUR MIND View February 4, 2011 Assange believes the government keeps important secrets? And that mainstream media play along? That is kooky. hey pete KOOKY??? I THINK YR KOOKY TOO!! FOR NOT…. UNDERSTANDING.. THE FULL JULIAN HERE!! Adam Heilbrun View February 4, 2011 I just did a Google search on "governments lie." There were thousands of hits. It seems that I am not the only person to believe so. Most prestigious: "All governments lie" is probably I. F. Stone's best-known statement Matt View February 4, 2011 @McMike – great comment, I think you said it perfectly. TimN View February 4, 2011 Say, OPEN YOUR MIND, what on earth are you trying to say? And, this is probably not worth the effort here, but all-caps and several exclamation points or question marks are the mark of an imbecile. My apologies if you were making some kind of elaborate, abstruse joke. It got right by me, kiddo. David View February 4, 2011 I admit the Kroft was an SOB. However, he did allow Julian to correct misconceptions on most occasions. I would like to know Julian's evaluation of the interview. Does anyone know how we could find out? Absolutely, Julian is a hero of mine. It is difficult to defend against people who are usually rational thinking family members. Norman View February 4, 2011 Come on people, don't you know a subterfuge when you see one? Goodness, all the print that has been wasted over this. Just another cover up for what is really taking place. Also, one might consider 2 other aspects, 1-clean out the old garbage, 2-embarrass the State Department; read that as Clinton and "O". Great for the future 2012 Election, wouldn't you agree? ellwort View February 4, 2011 Norman - Yes! It's clear that Assange is just a pawn in the Clinton gang's big plan to hurt your hamster. robin b. View February 4, 2011 I think Assange came across as a real class act on 60 Minutes. Steve Kroft, not so much. Nightrelic View February 5, 2011 Even here I think people are not quite understanding what Julian Assange is. He's more a publisher than a journalist. A journalist goes out into the field, finds stories that need telling and brings them back to a newspaper or magazine publisher to be published. So, in essence, Assange really fits into the scheme of things more as a publisher than as a journalist, though I suppose he could conceivably be both. The other thing i find rather a shame and rather odd is that 25 years ago, it would have been 60 Minutes someone would bring a story like this to rather than Assange. These days, I find the stories I hear on 60 Minutes tend to be retread of things I heard elsewhere a year or two ago. In fact, some of their stories are really just fluff- like when Anderson Cooper is on. It's a shame an news institution like 60 Minutes has been gutted in this way. It used to be news was about getting the scoop- getting the story before anyone else did. Now it's more about repeating all the fluff the other guy said So, essentially Assange scooped everyone. He was nice enough to let the New York Times and a few others in on it. Perhaps what's really going on in the media over Assange is outright jealousy. He beat everyone else out of the story of the decade after all. I think the Nobel Peace Prize nomination was well desrved and hope Assange and Wikileaks wins it. Jean Clelland-Morin View February 5, 2011 I've had a conspiracy mentality ever since I learned about our shenanigans in Chile. // Jean Clelland-Morin J "Rolin" Stone View February 5, 2011 The Weekly blog. I love it for the much needed laugh each week. I realize though that it will be a tearful irony for the most part. However, there does occasionally come a gem. And after having watched 60 minutes myself and marveling at the questions they asked as if they were exposing some evil corporate polluter, I wondered if they would recognize their own reflection if confronted with it. After all, 60 Minutes was the lone "wikileaks" of the 1960s, bringing that era's evil revelations to public awareness. I missed the set-up though, and appreciate that I've had time to calm down and can better appreciate the SNL-like quality to those opening lines. 60 Minutes was a program that once was a heroic purveyor of the truth just as Julian Assange is now. Watching this show reminded me why I don't admire them any longer, and why I gave up on mainstream journalism of any kind more than a decade ago. Martin GoÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÂ«s View February 5, 2011 You might think whatever You want about the person Julian Assange – what is told and printed about him in mainstream media must not be taken litterally – but as a publisher and muckraker he definitly deserves his place in Our future history books. When people like Joe Biden, Sarah Palin et consortes are yelling about high treason, imprisonment, hanging etc., it is a symptom of that there is something rotten in the state. The White House, State Department, Pentagon etc. cannot take for granted that classified material DOES NOT leak out, when Â&frac12; a million, certainly more, people have access to it. It is a sign of health when people mistrust the authorities and believe they have piles of shit to hide. Look, we have been fed with fairy tales since the beginning of civilization, either from kings or from priests, but since the invention of the World Wide Web, it is hardly impossible to hide away uncomfortable facts for people – lies will be ripped into pieces, sooner or later. As a comment to mark winget, I think it is about time for the American people to stand up for their fundamental and constitutional rights, before it is too late. When the Chinese creditors comes and urge You to pay the debt, it will be a VERY, VERY harsh and humilliating lesson for the yet only, but soon former, superpower on Earth – and YouÂ´ll bet that the rich tycoons in the big companies wonÂ´t pay the bill, YOU will pay the bill!!! I really hope that the bankers are shivering over whatÂ´s next on Wikileaks… The World is full of armchair reformers. The problem is how to make them raise from their comfortable positions and DO something! You, mark winget, is in a position where You can spread information and opinions face to face. Make use of that opportunity! I try to do the same from my little corner of Our planet, via the web, from a little house on an island in Sweden. michael e View February 5, 2011 Mr Assange has every right to report whatever news he LEGALLY obtains,or is legally obtained.What do i mean by that?Well lets say someone has the ablomb to tape a secret meeting with the president.A rogue Senator lets say.Or someone bugs the oval office or the presidential home space in the white house(yes i know it is well protected,but for the sake of argument…)Should those recordings be given to Mr Assange for his learned disbursement? In the ideal of freedom of speech? I think what Sarah was talking about in saying "hunt them down",was to track, and capture those who had stolen(yes stolen)sensitive documents.Some of these people are in my eyes no better than spys.Note that Hilary Clinton and Barrack Obama agree with that assessment. Joe Bidons full remarks were along those same lines. You see you can not be a conduit for information possibly /probably taken by illegal means,and believe you will be free from prosecution.Mr Assange plays that game for his own profit and grandeur.I doubt he cares about the nobler aspirations of freedom past that.Sorry,yes i do think he has an ax to grind against this country.One interesting aspect is no- one has researched is why. Betty Gelinas View February 5, 2011 We're all familiar with the way the label "liberal" is used to marginalize an opponent. Now we see how "conspiracy theorist" works just as well. The problem with labels is that they only serve to confuse. I watched 60 Minutes only because Julian Assange was being interviewed. But I long ago stopped watching what was once a brave and catalytic 60 Minutes. We need whistle blowers; we will always need whistle blowers to keep governments honest! julian b View February 5, 2011 From one Julian to another, assange is cIa Lucky Saint Luis View February 5, 2011 Steve Kroft, there are many thousands of you, limited, jealeouse and coward living upon public attention (thats the business of journalism) no matter what to say, how to say, what to silence, how to twist opinions. All of a sudden all you guys here are wrong because you keep forgetting "business first" which is the base of media, which makes it vulnerable like it does with all our governments worldwide! Hardly you can accept the dirty US foreign policy nor understand that it aint limited to the US but there is cero IQ when it gets to the root of it all. Money aint evil but the influences it got on simply everything, including on a honest government, is what we got to resolve. Media, foreign policies, cultures, economies, trade, everything will change for good if we remove the influential and speculative part of money, but yet you are not even capable to see how the entire US is conducted by a very small background and still believe money grows out of the hands of A government. Nightgaunt View February 5, 2011 How does what Assange and Wikileaks have done benefited and in turn the USA by any of these leaks? In a word—nothing. A familiar tactic label your enemy with what you are or for and then condemn them for the mythical position. Eldon Rollins View February 5, 2011 A lot of the big news in the 60's was gotten from illegally obtained documents. Also – even though the wiki-leaks material and Julian Assange seem to be roundly condemned by mainstream media – their criticisms keep the material in the public eye, which may ultimately prove to be a good, especially if they get the Nobel Prize. As far as the State Department? Their reaction is probably as much from embarrassment as anything, and distancing themselves from whatever fallout there may ultimately be. Obtaining documents illegally? If all secret documents had a reasoned and justifiable purpose for being secret – maybe it wouldn't be such a great thing to obtain them illegally. One thing wiki-leaks has shown is that the label of secrecy is often used for things like job protection, which is not a really compelling reason for making them secret documents protected by law. Personally, I hope the Nobel peace prize goes to the Egyptian people. Carol Crown View February 6, 2011 I second everything Victoria Park said in her post here. The fact that Croft throws his own profession under the bus without batting an eye is cause for all of us to be concerned about the ability of the 4th Estate to do its job as a watchdog for us all. The man clearly has no sense at all of the job of the press…scary! Maybe all those new assignments into triviality that reporters are now given has blinded them to their real job. Martin GoÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÂ«s View February 6, 2011 Many commentators above means that CBS 60 minutes has declined over teh past decades. I think they are right. The program has also appeared in Swedish television, to and fro, for at least two decades, first in the State Television, and later in commercial channels, and IÂ´ve seen it sporadically over the years. The critics are right – 60 minutes HAS declined. The first times I saw it, some time in the late 80ies, early 90ies, I thought it was sharp and informing, but the few last times IÂ´ve stumbled into it – often after midnight; itÂ´s not broadcasted on primetime – I think itÂ´s just another product of the Hollywoodization of the whole American society. Once upon a time, State Departement and Pentagon implemented a search for a foolproof system for communication, which couldnÂ´t collapse even in case of a nuclear attack. And today, in the days of Wikileaks, it – the World Wide Web – is proven just foolproof!! Every attempt to trace and close down Wikileaks is useless – it pops up in other places. In other words, the foolproof system has backfired upon its creators. Maybe it is time for the diplomats, military authorities etc. to back the tape, and go back to reliable low-tech solutions. Letters on paper CAN be read by others, but itÂ´s hard to spread them to the whole World with a clic…. I think it is easier to keep secrets that way. pelle lindbergh View February 13, 2011 Speaking of "Woodstein"… …and, in particular, WaPo's then Editor-In-Chief — Ben Bradlee — Kroft's cheap labeling of Assange is also known in journalism as a "non-denial denial." As is Joe Biden's piety and Sarah Palin's uncontrollable butt springs about ones' patriotic duty to lie for their government no matter what their conscience tells them. Worse, she will no doubt drone on about America's "need" for protection from whomever she calls traitors and seditioners. And no doubt until the end of time. When Sarah isn't hiding behind the flag, or the cross, the US Constitution is her the resort of last resort. No matter how little of it she's read or even understands. Meanwhile, Joe Biden remains in servitude to American Big Business and its MSM. One doesn't need a crystal ball to predict what his next smear of a prisoner of conscience will be. Don't hold your breath that these folks will ever address the WikiLeaks accusations at face value — nor will they be any less vocal in their scapegoating of Assange and Bradley Manning. Political demagoguery demands that both be given a life sentence w/o parole in the dankness of Gitmo. International pressure might save Assange from such a fate. But Manning will probably never see the light of day unless we stand up for him. Two generations ago, The New Yorker Magazine and Walter Winchell kept the fire to the feet of Iva Toguri d'Aquino — aka "Tokyo Rose." She never was anything of the sort. And it's not because no one could actually find a Radio Tokyo announcer calling herself "Tokyo Rose." There were, in fact, over 20 English-speaking women that Japan used to broadcast to GIs and sailors in the Pacific. Toguri had little choice but to passively acquiesce and work for the Japanese government just to get a ration card. Yet somehow she managed to smuggle food and medicine to Allied prisoners, never succumbed to increasing Japanese pressure that she renounce her US citizenship, and revealed no military secrets to the enemy (since she didn't have any to reveal). In spite of this, she served 10 years in a Federal prison for treason, then waited another 20 years for the US government to pardon her and restore her US citizenship. In short, Iva Toguri was a hero, not a villain. The similarity between Iva Toguri and Assange and Manning is all too striking and saddening. And it's all just so much bullsh*t. America isn't an empire in decline anymore. It's in free fall. Raymond View February 14, 2011 Mark Winget, regulations came into being because business and toadies were abusing the public, selling things that were not what they claimed them to be. To protect the people, regulations were put in place that benefited the people, they were not implemented to screw the people. Government works to curb the greed of corporate types. http://www.alternet.org/story/149892/5_ways_corporate_scavengers_are_making_big_money_off_of_our_economic_pain As indicated above, this is what regulations are supposed to protect the public from. In the Progressive Populist, it was reported that there were major violations by drug companies, including Pfizer, Glaxo-Smith Kline, Eli Lilly, Schering Plough, Bristol Myers, Squibb, AstraSeneca, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Merck, Serons, Purdue, Allergen, Novartis, Cephalon, Johnson & Johnson, Forest Laboratories, Sanofi_Aventis, Bayer, Mylan, Teva, and King Pharmaceuticals. Penalties under the Federal False Claims Act, no less than 165 violations by these companies since 1991. The penalties exceeds the defense industries overcharging fraud. The amount is greater than $20 billion dollars. The last five years has been the worst. Violations include hawking drugs that the uses for which are unproven and are dangerous. Pfizer paid $1.2 billion for illegal off label promotions. Among some of the violations was Medicaid and Medicare outright fraud from these drug companies. More violations like unlawful promotions, monopoliy practices, kickbacks, hiding study findings, poor manufacturing practices, environmental violations, financial violations, and illegal distributions. And these were just the ones who got caught. Not included in the findings of the report, are outright counterfeiting, adding questionable ingredients in drugs from India and China due to the outsourcing by US and European drug companies. These drug companies are very powerful, and have over 400 lobbyists, while the DOJ is short staffed and short willed. States may start to hold these companies accountable. I think we should prosecute the CEOs by putting them in jail for violations by their companies, and in addition remove them from the lucrative market of the government led business if they ever violate the regulations. And you think that regulations are bad??What would happen if we did not hold these drug companies accountable? robert lockwood mills View February 18, 2011 Yeah, Mr. Croft.

Posted by Commander Randy on January 31, 2011 at 12:47am View Blog The vibrant protest movements across the Arab world, Russian human rights activists and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will all likely be in the running for the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, observers say as the deadline for nominating candidates approaches. According to existing rules, the Norwegian Nobel Committee will only consider candidate proposals sent by February 1 for its pick, to be announced in October.   Since news events often influence nominations, this year's list of candidates could be coloured by the recent waves of protests against authoritarian Arab regimes, including in Tunisia and Egypt. "That's a possibility," explained Nobel expert and historian Asle Sveen.   "But no name really stands out. In Egypt, the (opposition) movement seems very spontaneous. And (the most visible opposition leader) Mohamed ElBaradei already received a Nobel prize" in 2005, he pointed out. The nature of the protests, which appear more motivated by socio-economic factors than ideological, could also complicate finding an obvious candidate.   The names of nominees are kept secret for 50 years, and although those entitled to nominate candidates are allowed to reveal their picks, Nobel observers are basically condemned to making educated guesses as to who will figure on the list. Thousands of people are eligible to submit nominations, including members of parliament and government worldwide, university professors, previous laureates and members of several international institutes. The five-member Nobel Committee that awards the prize is also eligible to add to the list during its first meeting of the year, scheduled for February 28.   "Maybe a leader (of the popular uprisings in the Arab world) will stand out by then," Sveen said. After infuriating Beijing last year by handing the prestigious prize to jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Committee might also want to turn its attention to Russia this year, the historian mused. "We'll have to see how the situation evolves in the aftermath of the terror attack" that on January 24 killed 35 people at Moscow's largest airport. "If Moscow reacts by opting, as I suspect, for a hard line in the Caucasus region that puts pressure on human rights activists, those activists could become natural candidates for the Nobel," Sveen said. He speculated that two candidates mentioned among the favourites last year will likely be on the list again this year: female human rights activists Svetlana Gannushkina of Russia and Sima Samar of Afghanistan. "It has been a long time since the Nobel was given to a woman," Sveen points out, adding that "giving it to Sima Samar would have the additional benefit of raising the issue of women in Muslim countries." Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai was the last woman to receive the honour in 2004. Another likely candidate this year is Australian former hacker Julian Assange, the founder of world-rocking whistleblower website WikiLeaks, which is in the midst of slowly releasing some 250,000 confidential US diplomatic cables. But experts are sceptical of his chances of grabbing the prize. "To claim that his actions have in some way promoted 'fraternity among nations,' to invoke the famous line in Alfred Nobel's will, would be far-fetched, if not altogether inaccurate," US journalist and Nobel Peace Prize specialist Scott London told AFP. "It might be truer to say that he has undermined that fraternity by creating a culture of anxiety and suspicion in international affairs, especially between countries in volatile regions like the Middle East," he added.

THE WIKILEAKS NEWS & VIEWS BLOG for Monday, Day 65 Greg Mitchell on January 31, 2011 - 1:02 AM ET Share Tweet As I've done for more than nine weeks, I will be updating news and views on all things WikiLeaks all day, with new items added at the top.  All times are ET in USA.  You can contact me at epic1934@aol.com.  Read about or order my new book, "The Age of WikiLeaks:  From Collateral Murder to Cablegate,"   here. UPDATE:  Read the Tuesday edition of this blog over here. 10:15   Human Rights Watch: Egypt welcomed more CIA detainees than any other country from 1990s through 2005. 7:35 David House in video talks about visit with Bradley Manning yesterday.   7:15  Do I need to say this again to the lazy cynics?  WikiLeaks cables continue to prove valuable in so many ways.  Just check out this piece by the estimable James Mann at Foreign Policy on what they show about U.S. - China relations, how tense they are "in real time," and how one state dinner won't do much really. 7:10 @WikiLeaks tweets: "WikiLeaks releases 480 secret cables on Libya http://wikileaks.ch/reldate/2011-01-31_0.html ." 6:10  Heather Brooke of Guardian pokes some fun (via Twitter) at Telegraph for claiming Lockerbie scoop  (see below) from cable-- and links to Guardian story in December. 5:50  Another excerpt from The Guardian book which reveals that the paper's editor refused to share cables it planned to use with the State Dept. in a dramatic phone call --even refused to give them their ID numbers.  Yet the NYT, as editor Keller writes, shared quite a few and also decided not to publish some. 5:45  Another embarrassment from L.A. Times with headline: "R.I.P. WikiLeaks?"   5:10  We reported earlier the apparent deal with Assange passing WikiLeaks cables to The Telegraph after rift with Guardian.  Now Telegraph reporting first purported scoop -- on Lockerbie criminal release case.  Writer, at end, admits he was wrong about not much interesting in cables, now that his paper is getting them. UPDATE: And another, on BP's Russian arm cutting deals with "rogue states." 5:00 The @WikiLeaks feed with links to new cables on Jordan, including deals with U.S. on Afghanistan. 3:45 Joe Klein at Time with hysterical attack on WIkiLeaks, or "WikiLoss" as he puts it.  Makes claims about damage done by cable that go way beyond what nearly anyone else is saying.  Says with no evidence at all that China has hacked into the entire cable cache.  Hails the prissy Bill Keller  NYT piece from Sunday.  Suggests Qaddafi could help al-Qaeda stage operaton from his country because he's ticked about buxom nurse cable. And so on. 3:25  The Guardian with its latest extract from its new book, this time the full details, as they see it, on those now infamous, heated discussions with Assange in November over cablegate, and then how Der Spiegel scooped everyone, by a few hours.  3:18: Good Huff Post piece on "scandal everyone missed" -- on UK accepting storage of U.S. cluster bombs illegally.  Well, not everyone.  We noted it here way back in early December and it's also in my book. 3:15 Dan Gillmor at Salon suggests that weak, even absurd, Steve Kroft questions in interview last night were actually designed as "softballs" that Assange could hit out of the park.  Certainly Kroft did come off as more admiring of Assange in the "extra" video posted online. 2:45  David Leigh at the Guardian refutes notion that paper, in its new book, fingered Manning as definite guilty party.  1:15    "60 Minutes" ratings for Assange show last night ties low for year.  But had no football lead-in, but football competition, so hard to judge... 1:05  New post by Jane Hamsher at FDL on visit yesterday (with David House) with Bradley Manning, first in a month.  Lengthy.   Even gets into Manning on Tunisia and Egypt.  "Bradley was brought in to meet with David, per usual, in chains. His MAX custody classification means that the entire facility is on lockdown whenever he leaves his cell, and he must be accompanied by two guards at all time. During his conversations with David, Manning’s guards listen closely to everything they say, and make it a point to make noise and shift around frequently to call attention to their presence in the room." 11:40  Financial Times:  Assange, miffed at The Guardian, has signed agreement with rival London paper The Telegraph to publish cables in future (maybe bank release etc.).  Not confirmed by either side but FT seems pretty sure of it. 11:35 My brand-new book: This is the only place it can be purchased now, with no Amazon or store sales.   It's a 156-page paperback, selling for $11.95, and can be shipped all over the world.  Hailed by Dan Ellsberg and Glenn Greenwald.   Covers events through this week.  Just posted, 2nd exclusive excerpt from  book. 11:25  Norwegian paper Aftenposten with yet another cable -- this one on Norway making direct contact with the Taliban.  The government has denied. 11:15  Las Vegas paper with local angle (and case) on the defeat of whistleblower protections in Congress after WikiLeaks furor. 11:00  AP:  At that mass meeting of U.S. ambassadors (180) called by Hillary Clinton, topic of WikiLeaks fallout to be discussed... 10:30  Wonder why Glenn Greenwald has been so quiet the past few days? He explains today that he's been very ill and is still in the hospital.  9:45  Good piece here on James Ball, WikiLeaks "in-house journalist" who was so involved in releases this year.  He was there when Assange was to the manor borne.   Now he's joining The Guardian. 9:35  Opening with a reference to WikiLeaks, column at The Guardian on "unprecedented" debate over social responsibility and ethics for media. 9:10  Just posted, 2nd exclusive excerpt from my WIkiLeaks book:  Forget "60 Minutes"-- what happened when Stephen Colbert grilled Julian Assange last April?  A classic.   If you missed yesterday: First excerpt  from book.  9:00 It takes all kinds: New York Yankees fan imagines what would happen if WikiLeaks exposed secrets of his team... 8:00  24/7 Wall St. blog claims banks don't much to fear from WikiLeaks since they've been under such scrutiny from governmetn past two years.  Oh really? 7:50  The Overnight Report (by Asher Wolf)  Paul Carr at Tech Crunch has produced an intensely venomous article, describing Julian Assange as a "pig-to-man" .....Meanwhile, Michael Goodwin at Fox News claims Wikileaks is an organization "eager to damage America." .... But Barry Miles at The Guardian disagrees: Wikileaks acts "... in the tradition of the underground press, particularly as the US is attempting to suppress it, just as it tried to undermine the underground papers that led the anti-Vietnam campaign." ...El Pais'  latest on Assange and Wikileaks. 7:30  The Guardian continues its rollout of its new WikiLeaks book with video featuring three of the authors.  See other excerpts.  Assange criticized paper's coverage yesterday.  Plus from its techies: How it has handled WikiLeaks "data." 12:05 Assange for Nobel Peace Prize?  Sure to be nominated by deadline Tuesday but experts skeptical.  Case in Sweden doesn't help. 12:02  WL Central reviews the day in WikiLeaks--and new protests in the Sudan as Al Jazeera gets the boot in Egypt. 12:01  David Swanson reviews the "60 Minutes" interview and wonders why the world of what the WikiLeaks releases have exposed was left out. 12:00 My Nation colleague Kevin Gosztola on  "ROTC's Response to WikiLeaks Puts Academic Freedom at Risk." From late Sunday: Andy Greenberg of Forbes on that CBS poll we noted earlier with 42% saying they didn't really know what the hell WikiLeaks is.   In "overtime" segment, CBS posts video on interviewing Assange -- Kroft much more favorable than in interview and even says flatly that, yes, he does feel Assange IS a journalist and IS a publisher.  Says stereotypes about Assange mainly false.  Interviewed for six hours, disrupted by having to go to police station. Many more extras here.  "60 Minutes"  needs to correct error-- Assange did NOT decide to share cables with NYT -- the Guardian did against his wishes. Feeble "60 Minutes" effort by Steve Kroft--among other things, acted like the media also publishes classified info all the time.  Assange hit several questions out of the park, and likely encouraging more leaks and money to WikiLeaks.  @WikiLeaks feed hits The Guardian for extract from book:  "Guardian names Manning as source.  Sarah Tisdall mark 2. The slimiest media organization in the UK....  It should be noted, that as far as we know, neither we, nor the Guardian have any inside knowledge as to who the sources are."  David Leigh of The Guardian fires right back:  "All the #guardian book says abt bradley manning is already in public domain. Of course we don't name a 'source'. Why Lie, Julian?"   And;"  You won't go to heaven if you lie about the #Guardian book.  You'll go somewhere else."  THE AGE OF WIK... From "Collater...

STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Rixstep) — Julian Assange was questioned a single time by the Swedish police on 30 August 2010. By this time all charges saved one ('molestation') had been dismissed by chief prosecutor Eva Finné. The interrogation took place late in the day because Assange's legal counsel Leif Silbersky was in court with the infamous 'helicopter robbery' trial. The interrogation lasted 54 minutes with a short pause in the middle to clear up questions Assange wanted to ask the police, specifically related to his apprehension the entire conversation would once again make its way to the tabloid Expressen. The interrogation took place at the 'family violence' unit of the police at Bergsgatan 48 in Stockholm, began at 17:43, and concluded at 18:37. There were five people present. Mats Gehlin (MG) - the chief interrogator Ewa Olofsson (EO) - the police interrogation witness Gun von Krusenstjerna (GK) - the interpreter Leif Sibersky (LS) - Julian's legal counsel at the time Julian Assange (JA) Leif Silbersky spoke English with his client save on one occasion. Julian Assange's testimony was later translated and transcribed by Jennie Wolgast. READ MORE.... The Transcript, Julian Assange's own words, Rixstep ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 2011-01-31 Assange in Sweden: Sofia The unfinished police statement of Sofia Wilén. STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Rixstep) — Sofia Wilén and Anna Ardin arrived at the Klara police station in downtown Stockholm on Friday afternoon 20 August 2010. The interrogation of Sofia was conducted by criminal inspector Irmeli Krans that same day. Sofia and Irmeli were informed during the interrogation that Julian Assange had been arrested in absentia and the police were hunting for him in the Stureplan nightclub area. Irmeli notes that Sofia seemed to go to pieces on hearing the news and that she therefore decided to abort the interrogation without the protocol being read back to Sofia or approved by her. Irmeli, an acquaintance of Anna Ardin, was to return to work on Monday and copyedit the interrogation and 'sign' it but discovered at that time that she'd been locked out of the system. Correspondence between Irmeli and her superior Mats Gehlin is included at the end of this article. Irmeli seems to have been against classifying the allegation as 'rape' and protested she was given no opportunity to discuss the matter with prosecutor on duty Maria Häljebo Kjellstrand. Yet before Irmeli concluded her interrogation - and she was the only one who knew any details of the case - Julian Assange was arrested in absentia and hunted through the streets of the Swedish capital. Irmeli Krans was thereafter taken off the case. The interrogation is in the loosest possible form, a so-called 'conceptual interrogation' ('konceptförhör'). The interrogation therefore takes the form of a narrative. Irmeli Krans writes on 1 September as follows. Friday 20 August 2010 I conducted an interrogation with Sofia Wilén in the case 0201-K246314-10 at the Klara police station. The interrogation began at 16:21 and was concluded before being completed or reviewed or approved at 18:40. It was logged into the word processing application DurTvå. The interrogation was to be copyedited the next work day, Monday 23 August 2010. This was not possible because I was denied access to the interrogation I'd conducted. After a few message exchanges I was given the directive by officer Mats Gehlin to instead create and sign a new interrogation in DurTvå which was carried out 26 August with the necessary modifications. Unfortunately that document was dated and time stamped with the date and time of the correction automatically by the DurTvå system. READ MORE...
