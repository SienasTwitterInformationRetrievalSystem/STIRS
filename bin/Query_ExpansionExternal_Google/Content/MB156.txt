(LUKE FRAZZA/AFP/Getty Images) Former President George W. Bush announced Friday that his dog, Barney, passed away. "Laura and I are sad to announce that our Scottish Terrier, Barney, has passed away. The little fellow had been suffering from lymphoma and after twelve and a half years of life, his body could not fight off the illness," said Bush in a statement. "Barney and I enjoyed the outdoors. He loved to accompany me when I fished for bass at the ranch. He was a fierce armadillo hunter. At Camp David, his favorite activity was chasing golf balls on the chipping green." Bush went on, "Barney guarded the South Lawn entrance of the White House as if he were a Secret Service agent. He wandered the halls of the West Wing looking for treats from his many friends. He starred in Barney Cam and gave the American people Christmas tours of the White House. Barney greeted Queens, Heads of State, and Prime Ministers. He was always polite and never jumped in their laps." He concluded, "Barney was by my side during our eight years in the White House. He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend. Laura and I will miss our pal." New York Magazine wrote in October that Bush had taken up paintings of dogs and "arid Texas landscapes." Politico reported that Barney is survived by the Bush family's other Scottish Terrier, Miss Beazley. Also on HuffPost: Loading Slideshow Kiss, Kiss You Forgot To Salute Barney Be Gentle.

Bush’s dog Barney dies Sign In Username Subscribe Post Politics George W. Bush’s dog Barney dies More By Rachel Weiner February 1, 2013 Follow @rachelweinerwp A painting by George W. Bush of Barney, courtesy of the Bush family. President George W. Bush's dog Barney has died of lymphoma at the age of 12, the former president said in a statement Friday. "Barney was by my side during our eight years in the White House," Bush wrote. "He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend. Laura and I will miss our pal." Bush, who has been learning to paint, published his own oil portrait of Barney as well as a Facebook album of the former first dog. The Scottish terrier came to the White House with the Bushes; he was a gift to Laura Bush from Christine Todd Whitman, then governor of New Jersey, for the first lady's birthday in 2000. While in the White House, he was the subject of annual "Barney Cam" videos and had his own Web site -- Barney.gov. (He was also known to get a little territorial, once biting a Reuters reporter on the North Lawn.) The Bushes have another Scottish terrier, Miss Beazley, a gift from the president to his wife in 2005. Here is a picture of both terriers with President Bush in 2008. The full statement: Laura and I are sad to announce that our Scottish Terrier, Barney, has passed away.  The little fellow had been suffering from lymphoma and after twelve and a half years of life, his body could not fight off the illness. Barney and I enjoyed the outdoors.  He loved to accompany me when I fished for bass at the ranch.  He was a fierce armadillo hunter.  At Camp David, his favorite activity was chasing golf balls on the chipping green. Barney guarded the South Lawn entrance of the White House as if he were a Secret Service agent.  He wandered the halls of the West Wing looking for treats from his many friends.  He starred in Barney Cam and gave the American people Christmas tours of the White House. Barney greeted Queens, Heads of State, and Prime Ministers.  He was always polite and never jumped in their laps.  Barney was by my side during our eight years in the White House.  He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend.  Laura and I will miss our pal.   View Photo Gallery —Take a stroll down memory lane and reminisce about White House pets from the past.   Rachel Weiner covers cops and courts in Arlington and Alexandria.   Share on FacebookShare   Share on TwitterTweet SECTION: {section=politics, subsection=null}!!!

Bush, dies of lymphoma Former President George W. Bush bids farewell to his Scottish Terrier Barney, who stuck by his side through thick and thin. The loyal dog died of lymphoma at 12. BY Michael Walsh NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, February 2, 2013, 12:28 PM A A A RICK WILKING/REUTERS Bush and Barney take it easy in his pickup truck at the family's ranch in Crawford, Texas. A doggone good dog has chased his last golf ball. Former President George W. Bush announced that Barney, his beloved Scottish Terrier, died Friday. The furry black canine was 12. "Laura and I are sad to announce that our Scottish Terrier, Barney, has passed away," Bush said. "The little fellow had been suffering from lymphoma and after twelve and a half years of life, his body could not fight off the illness." Barney was born in Sept. 30, 2000, in New Jersey but spent most of his life at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., where he was the nation's First Dog from 2001 to 2009. J. Scott Applewhite/AP President Bush slows his pace to wait for his dog Barney as he walks to the Oval Office at the White House in 2003. "Barney guarded the South Lawn entrance of the White House as if he were a Secret Service agent," Bush remembered. "He wandered the halls of the West Wing looking for treats from his many friends. He starred in Barney Cam and gave the American people Christmas tours of the White House." GALLERY: ANIMALS, THEY'RE JUST LIKE PEOPLE The feisty pup shared Bush's love of the open air and joined him on excursions from the capital to Camp David and the family's ranch in Crawford, Texas. "Barney and I enjoyed the outdoors," Bush said. "He loved to accompany me when I fished for bass at the ranch. He was a fierce armadillo hunter. At Camp David, his favorite activity was chasing golf balls on the chipping green." JASON REED/Reuters Barney sits near microphones outside the West Wing of the White House. Barney saw more foreign dignitaries in a year than most people see in a lifetime. He was well behaved when high-ranking guests from across the globe visited the former First Family. GALLERY: CUTEST BABIES IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM "Barney greeted Queens, Heads of State, and Prime Ministers. He was always polite and never jumped in their laps," Bush said. But most importantly, Barney was Bush's loyal pal through thick and thin. The cuddly companion stayed by his owner's side when his approval ratings plummeted and never broached the issue. "He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend. Laura and I will miss our pal," Bush closed his heartfelt statement. mwalsh@nydailynews.com George W.

Home > Trail Blazers Blog Former First Dog Barney Bush passes away at age 12 By Tom Benning tbenning@dallasnews.com 3:47 pm on February 1, 2013 | Permalink US President George W. Bush(2nd-R) and First Lady Laura Bush (R) trail behind their dog Barney after arriving back at the White House 07 November, 2004. (AFP PHOTO / TIM SLOAN) Former First Dog Barney Bush — a black Scottish terrier known for chasing golf balls and taking America on video tours of the White House — has passed away after a battle with lymphoma. He was 12. An oil painting of Barney by former President George W. Bush. Former President George W. Bush announced on Friday the passing of the “little fellow,” saying in a news release that “after twelve and a half years of life, his body could not fight off the illness.” “Barney was by my side during our eight years in the White House,” said Bush, who also released Friday an oil painting he did of Barney. “He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend. Laura and I will miss our pal.” Barney was born Sept. 30, 2000, according to his official biography. His mother was Coors, a Scottish Terrier owned by former Environmental Protection Agency Director Christine Todd Whitman, and his father was Kelly of Champion Motherwell Stormwarning. Barney had his own section on the Bush Administration’s official White House website, along with a fairly substantial Wikipedia page. And he became of fixture of presidential proceedings at the White House, Camp David and the Bushes’ Crawford ranch. “At Camp David, his favorite activity was chasing golf balls on the chipping green,” Bush said. “Barney guarded the South Lawn entrance of the White House as if he were a Secret Service agent. He wandered the halls of the West Wing looking for treats from his many friends. He starred in Barney Cam and gave the American people Christmas tours of the White House.” Among Barney’s many notable adventures was the time he bit the hand of a White House reporter who got too close. Former Bush political guru Karl Rove jokingly called the dog a “lump.” Bush said Barney was a “fierce armadillo hunter” who “loved to accompany me when I fished for bass at the ranch.” Bush also said the dog was “always polite” when meeting queens, heads of state and prime ministers and that Barney “never jumped in their laps.” Barney is survived by his fellow Scottish terrier, Miss Beazley, and Bob the cat.

The Scottish Terrier was 12 years old and described by Bush as the son he never had. Barney was born in New Jersey but grew up in Washington, D.C. He is survived by his owners Laura and George W. Bush, as well as a niece, Miss Beazley, who is also owned by the Bushes. Barney is memorialized here in an oil painting done by Dubya — who clearly doesn't want you to forget he was the 43rd president — himself. President Bush issued this statement on Facebook: Laura and I are sad to announce that our Scottish Terrier, Barney, has passed away. The little fellow had been suffering from lymphoma and after twelve and a half years of life, his body could not fight off the illness. Barney and I enjoyed the outdoors. He loved to accompany me when I fished for bass at the ranch. He was a fierce armadillo hunter. At Camp David, his favorite activity was chasing golf balls on the chipping green. Barney guarded the South Lawn entrance of the White House as if he were a Secret Service agent. He wandered the halls of the West Wing looking for treats from his many friends. He starred in Barney Cam and gave the American people Christmas tours of the White House. Barney greeted Queens, Heads of State, and Prime Ministers. He was always polite and never jumped in their laps. Barney was by my side during our eight years in the White House. He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend. Laura and I will miss our pal. Though Barney's life was relatively brief, it was not without its controversies. Barney was ridiculed by Russian President Vladimir Putin who believed owning a small dog was weak. During a trip to Russia, Barney met Putin's Labrador Koni who Putin described as "bigger, tougher, stronger, faster, meaner." He also had a mean streak, biting Reuters reporter Jon Decker and Boston Celtics public relations director Heather Walker. Prior to succumbing to lymphoma, Barney had one previous brush with death: when President Bush dropped him on his face in front of some horrified children. Rest in peace, Barney.

Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush. Barney had his own official web page which redirected to an extension of the White House website. Barney was born in New Jersey and he was often referred to as the "First Dog."

The dog's father is known as Kelly. Miss Beazley, the Bushes' other Scottish terrier, is Barney's niece through his half-brother, Clinton. Interests[edit] Barney at play in the Oval Office. Barney is said to have enjoyed playing with volleyballs and golf balls, and enjoyed observing games of horseshoes. There are various web sites across the Internet devoted to Barney. Most notably, he was the main star of the White House's annual Christmas videos during the Bush administration. Barney was featured in several films that go by the name of Barneycam and are made by the White House Staff, and star both Barney himself and Miss Beazley, the other presidential canine. These movies can be found on the George W. Bush archived White House web site. Media attention[edit] Laura, George and Barney at TSTC Waco Airport Bob Woodward quotes Bush about Barney[edit] Barney was evoked in a famous Bush quote cited by Bob Woodward about the Iraq War in State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III (ISBN 0743272234) and repeated during a 60 Minutes interview: "Late last year he had key Republicans up to the White House to talk about the war. And said, 'I will not withdraw even if Laura and Barney are the only ones supporting me.' Barney is his dog," Woodward says. "My work on this leads to lots of people who spend hours, days with the president." [4] Criticism by Karl Rove and Vladimir Putin[edit] White House official Karl Rove remarked shortly after his resignation that Barney was "a lump." Barney has also been criticized by Russian President Vladimir Putin who feels a world leader should own large robust dogs, not smaller breeds such as the Scottish Terrier. At a later date, when Putin introduced Bush to Koni, his black labrador, Putin is reported to have remarked that Koni is "(b)igger, tougher, stronger, faster, meaner, than Barney."[5] Satires[edit] On November 27, 2006, Barney was featured in an article in satirical newspaper The Onion titled "Troop Morale Boosted By Surprise Visit From First Dog".[6] The article described a fictitious visit by Barney to troops in Iraq. On December 14, 2006, The Daily Show satirized Barney's Holiday Extravaganza.[7] Barney was, at one point, satirized in "The Bugle". On January 23, 2007, Scottie Tails posted a satire video of a Wheaten-colored terrier named Kenzie asking Barney to contact her about a date. [8][9] Bites[edit] On November 6, 2008, Barney bit Reuters news reporter Jon Decker's finger.[10] Barney had bitten Boston Celtics public relations director Heather Walker on the wrist on September 19, 2008 breaking the skin and drawing blood, but the incident was not reported until after the November 6 elections. Laura Bush's spokesperson joked afterwards that "I think it was his way of saying he was done with the paparazzi."[11] Death[edit] Barney died of lymphoma.[3] On February 1, 2013, Bush posted this to his Facebook page, Statement by President George W. Bush on the passing of Barney Bush: Laura and I are sad to announce that our Scottish Terrier, Barney, has passed away. The little fellow had been suffering from lymphoma and after twelve and a half years of life, his body could not fight off the illness. Barney and I enjoyed the outdoors. He loved to accompany me when I fished for bass at the ranch. He was a fierce armadillo hunter. At Camp David, his favorite activity was chasing golf balls on the chipping green. Barney guarded the South Lawn entrance of the White House as if he were a Secret Service agent. He wandered the halls of the West Wing looking for treats from his many friends.

He was always polite and never jumped in their laps. Barney was by my side during our eight years in the White House. He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend. Laura and I will miss our pal.[3] Barney was survived by the Bushes’ other Scottish Terrier, Miss Beazley, who later died in 2014.[12] Barney and Miss Beazley are honored with a bronze sculpture at the George W. Bush Library.[13] Filmography[edit] Barney in A Red, White, and Blue Christmas. Barney has starred in eleven government film productions. His latest, Barney Cam VII: A Red, White and Blue Christmas, is a 2008 Christmas video featuring George W. Bush and members of his immediate family, and many American Olympians.[14] In it, he dreams of winning several honors for the United States before being woken up by President Bush, who needs Barney's help in preparing for Christmas.
