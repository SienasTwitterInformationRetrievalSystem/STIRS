(Bonnie Jo Mount/WASHINGTON POST) By J. Freedom du Lac February 26, 2013 Follow @jfdulac Let the double downs begin. Maryland Live Casino will begin offering live blackjack, craps, roulette and other table games April 11, marking a milestone in the state’s dramatic expansion of casino gambling. The suburban slots hall — one of the largest commercial casinos in the country and by far the biggest in the Free State — will add 122 live-action tables, with dealers, dice, cards, chips and security cameras. A smaller gambling venue, Hollywood Casino Perryville, plans to introduce table games March 7, pending one final greenlight from the General Assembly, casino spokeswoman Jennifer Miglionico said. The casino, which sits along I-95 between Baltimore and Wilmington, Del., will have a dozen live games plus an eight-table poker area. Maryland Live’s date was announced Tuesday, although casino officials said it is “pending final regulatory approval.” “The addition of live-action table games completes the world-class gaming and entertainment experience we have created at Maryland Live Casino,” Rob Norton, the property’s president and general manager, said in a statement. Table games were approved by Maryland voters in November, along with a sixth casino in Prince George’s County. As part of the gambling-expansion referendum, the state’s casinos are allowed to operate round-the-clock; Maryland Live hasn’t closed its doors since Dec. 27. Even without live-action table games, Maryland Live has been doing booming business since it opened June 6, pulling in an average of $1.1 million a day in gambling revenue, according to the state Lottery and Gaming Control Agency. Employees at the 160,000-square-foot casino at Arundel Mills mall in Hanover have been removing some of its 4,750 slot machines (the number will shrink to 4,332), tearing up carpets and reworking its wiring ahead of the table-games operation. “Pardon our dust, we’re making room for winners!” says a sign near an indoor construction zone. “Get ready for a full house!” another announces, although traditional poker tables won’t be included initially. The casino will offer Pai Gow, Three Card Poker, Mississippi Stud and other “carnival-style” variations of the game come April; casino officials plan to build a 50-table, split-level poker room in the summer. But the opening bet is on craps, blackjack and the carnival games, which will be offered at varying stakes. (The casino has some chips worth $10,000 each on order.) The new games will probably generate as much excitement as revenue for the casino, whose table games vice president Neal Sloane recently cited an industry aphorism: “Tables are for show, slots are for dough.” That’s not necessarily true at the high-limit tables on the Las Vegas Strip, where casinos cultivate big-money bettors who might play for $50,000 a hand. But in Pennsylvania, the market that analysts say is probably most comparable to Maryland, table games accounted for about 22 percent of gross casino gaming revenue last year, according to the state’s Gaming Control Board. Slots produced the rest. At Maryland Live, preparations for table games have been underway for months. Since Jan. 7, the casino and Anne Arundel Community College have been operating a dealer school at Marley Station mall in Glen Burnie, where about 800 gambling greenhorns are being trained as dealers. The casino plans to hire more than 500 first-timers, along with more than 200 experienced dealers from other states. J. Freedom du Lac is the editor of The Post's general assignment news desk.

Hollywood Casino Perryville is the first Maryland casino to offer live table games, including roulette, blackjack, poker and craps tables. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) By J. Freedom du Lac March 7, 2013 Follow @jfdulac The ace was dealt first, and then came the king. “There’s a blackjack!” the dealer said. “There it is,” Tom Truffer confirmed. It was mid-morning Thursday at Hollywood Casino in Perryville, on the first full day of table games anywhere in Maryland, and Truffer had won his first hand. The day he’d circled on his calendar was off to a good start. “I’ve been looking forward to this since November,” said Truffer, a salesman from Severna Park making his first visit to the former all-slots casino in Cecil County. Since voters approved a dramatic expansion of commercial gambling in the Free State, the buzz has been building over the introduction of live blackjack, craps and other table games. Hollywood Casino, a 75,000-square-foot property just off Interstate 95 between Baltimore and Wilmington, opened for live-action betting business on Wednesday afternoon — a day ahead of schedule. Maryland Live, the airplane-terminal-size casino at Arundel Mills mall, will add table games April 11. When voters in Maryland chose to allow games like blackjack and craps in casinos, it set in motion major changes at “Maryland Live!” in Hanover, Md. Videojournalist Brad Horn takes us behind the scenes for a look at what it takes to keep the games going at the growing casino. (The Fold/The Washington Post) “Tables have been filling up as quickly as I can open them,” Anthony Ventura, Hollywood Casino’s table games manager, said Thursday. And plenty of folks were clearly playing hooky from work to get in on the action. An entire table of blackjack players refused to be photographed on Thursday. Casino officials declined to say how much revenue the new games generated on the first partial day of action. But the previous night, all 12 tables in the gaming pit were going — and there wasn’t an open seat to be found anywhere. Five of eight tables in the new poker room were running, too, Ventura said. Business was even brisk in the wee hours: In addition to adding table games, the casino has added hours of operation and is now open all day, every day. The schedule change is so new that there were still hours-of-operation signs posted at the entrances Thursday. “It’s been nonstop since I walked in the door,” said Anthony Graziano, a blackjack dealer whose shift began at 4 a.m. “We definitely could have used more tables. People want to play.” He was inspecting and shuffling 16 new decks of cards. A man wondered whether he could sit down. “Sorry, this table is full metal jacket,” Graziano said. Herbert Hawks had a $100 bill in his hand and was passing time until the roulette table opened. “This is the first time I’ve ever been in here,” Hawks said. “Usually, I just go to Delaware or Atlantic City.” He lives in Glen Burnie, near Baltimore. “Real close,” he said. Maybe too close. “A little too easy,” he said of the drive. The state’s gaming regulators noted that this is National Problem Gambling Awareness Week. Hollywood Casino was the state’s first slots hall, opening in September of 2010. At one point, the property had 1,500 slot machines; but demand didn’t quite match up. “We never completely filled up,” said marketing director Jennifer Miglionico. And business dropped when Maryland Live opened last June, about 45 miles away. So the casino asked the state if it could remove some slots from its gaming floor even before the gambling referendum passed. It now has 1,148 slots. “We’d like to get it to 1,000 eventually,” Miglionico said. The 20 tables now stand where there were once slots. The conversion will eventually result in about 140 new jobs — dealers mostly, but also extra security and servers and such. Some positions still need to be filled. Most of the dealers are new to the trade; the casino put more than 75 greenhorns through dealer school. Casino operators predict that the table games will generate 2,000 new jobs across the state. Officials at Hollywood, whose parent company Penn National Gaming spent more than $40 million opposing the casino-expansion referendum, think table games will help attract a younger demographic, as well as new players such as Truffer who don’t play slots. “It’s why I’d never come here before,” he said. “I like blackjack best.” But after a promising start to his first session in his home state, the hospital lab equipment salesman was now losing. Hand after hand after hand. He was dealt a queen and a two. He hit. He got another two — for 14. Hit. Another two — for 16. Hit. “Give me a five!” he said. Graziano gave him a nine. Truffer busted, losing $25 with 25. “You needed that nine two twos ago,” Graziano said. “Thanks,” Truffer said. He wasn’t sure how long he planned to play. “That all depends on how I do,” he said. Within 90 minutes, he’d vanished. J. Freedom du Lac is the editor of The Post's general assignment news desk.

The casino, owned by Penn National, allows the facility to offer 20 table games — 12 of which feature variations of poker, blackjack, craps and roulette. There is also an eight-table poker room. “The Maryland Lottery has reviewed thoroughly the operations of Hollywood Casino Perryville, its adherence to internal controls and policies, and the training of its staff,” Martino said. “We believe the casino is prepared to open table games to the public.” Hollywood Casino Perryville conducted a successful controlled demonstration of the casino’s table games Tuesday, March 5. The goal of the demonstration, which was attended by approximately 150, was to test and assess the facility’s 20 table games; internal controls; employee training; surveillance and security; and technical systems. Hollywood Casino Perryvillewill donate its portion of the proceeds from the event to the Habitat for Humanity of the Chesapeake, the Cecil County Food Bank and the Cecil County College Foundation. In addition to offering table games, the casino also began around the clock operations today. Located just off of I-95 in Cecil County, Hollywood Casino Perryvillewas the first casino to open in Maryland in September 2010. The casino, which currently has 1,148 slot machines, also will be the first casino in the state to offer table games and is expected to hire an additional 140 employees as a result of the added table games. Maryland Live, which opened in June 2012, plans to offer table games to the public later this year. The Casino at Ocean Downs, which opened in January 2011, is planning an expansion and has not provided details on launching table games at this time. The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission is responsible for all matters relating to the regulation of the state’s casinos. In this regulatory role, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency (LGCA) oversees all internal controls, auditing, security, surveillance, background investigation, licensing and accounting procedures for the facilities.

(WJZ) — Rolling the dice. Maryland is just weeks away from its first-ever casino table games. Hollywood Casino in Perryville will have craps, poker and blackjack as early as March. Slots facilities all over the state are hoping these games bring a big economic boom. Kai Jackson has more on the statewide plan to cash in. Operators say the expansion of table games will make them full-fledged casinos. When the Hollywood Casino in Cecil County opened in 2010, it was clearly one of the biggest things to hit the small town of Perryville. Nearly three years later, the operators want to up the ante on gambling. Maryland voters approved the expansion of table games in a referendum last November. Now the Hollywood Casino says it will start table gaming in March. “We’re going to be able to draw some people that have never been here before and now give them a reason to want to come,” said Bill Hayles, Hollywood Casino. Maryland Live! Casino in Anne Arundel County has started training table game dealers. “I’d rather be behind the scenes, though, dealing versus playing and spending my money,” a dealer said. Maryland Live! has plans to open more than 120 table games. “We expect to be flipping cards and rolling die by early spring,” said General Manager Robert Norton. It’s estimated the expansion will generate 1,200 new jobs at Maryland Live! and 100 new jobs at Hollywood Casino. Operators say the expansion of table games makes them more attractive to customers. “This is going to make us a full-fledged casino,” Hayles said. Hollywood Casino believes they are–at this time–still waiting on permits from state regulators but say once the tables are in place, they think revenues will pick up. Maryland Live! says it doesn’t have a start date for table games yet. They’re planning for sometime this spring. View Comments blog comments powered by Disqus Listen Live!

(AP) - Hollywood Casino Perryville is the first casino in Maryland to have table games like blackjack. Continue reading Photo: John Morgan/Flickr Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency Director Stephen Martino signed the operations license on Wednesday allowing the casino to open table games to the public. The casino, which is owned by Penn National, is offering 20 table games. Twelve of them feature variations of poker, blackjack, craps and roulette. The casino, which is off Interstate 95 in Cecil County, also has an eight-table poker room. The casino, which was Maryland's first to open with slot machines in September 2010, held a controlled demonstration of its table games on Tuesday in a test run. Lawmakers held a special session last year to expand gambling to allow table games. Voters approved the expansion in November.

Per news reports, sounds like MD Live will have over 100 tables up at the start, and they plan to issue $10,000 chips (for the chip fanatics, per MD regulations, they will be oversized and silver in color. MD is going the Vegas route and using brown for $5000 chips). Per other reports, Hollywood Casino Perryville will be debuting its table games within the next 2 weeks.

If I could have borrowed his oar I would have stayed." Mark Twain February 26th, 2013 at 2:07:28 PM permalink silversonic2006 Member since: May 12, 2010 Threads: 32 Posts: 187 I'm actually not that surprised. MD got to watch the pains DE, PA, and WV went through with adding tables, so they had a better idea of what to expect.

Maybe we'll see $10 craps during off peak hours. But that's after the novelty wears off. I'd guess $25+ at all times until then, and that's in line with Parx in Philly, as well, which I view as a casino similar to MD Live, and has a nifty table min feature on their website that I hope MD Live gets too. As for Hollywood Perryville, I'll be interested to see where their mins end up. On one hand, people have clearly shown they are willing to pass there to go to DE Park, so if people have loyalty to DE Park and the table mins aren't cheaper, they won't start going to Hollywood. On the other hand, it's all about demand, and with only 12 non-poker tables, they might be able to pack them in enough to maintain $15+ mins at blackjack. I see Hollywood Perryville more as a "pit stop" casino than a destination casino, but that's my 2 cents. Being the nerd I am, I tried to see what the MD rules on Blackjack are, and I could be wrong, but it appears they went the DE/PA route and all blackjack is 3:2, S17. Good rules, but that'll keep the minimums higher. It also appears craps odds are capped at 10X, which is more than most casinos allow, except for the Horseshoe chain, which is known for odds up to 100X. I was at MD Live recently, and they must have just started moving stuff around to make way for tables. I don't see how they can possibly fit 150 of them in the space they've currently cleared out.

They could go lower (5X, 3-4-5X, etc). I doubt they'll go the Charles Town route of 2X. Also, glancing over the rules, MD clearly allows for Macau-style midi-baccarat. I'd imagine MD Live will follow Parx's lead and load up on those tables given the popularity of the game and the fact they can command much higher minimums (I've never seen under $25, and $50+ is more common). Who knows, maybe they'll even throw in one Big Baccarat table in the high limit room just to show they mean business, given the rarity of those tables nowadays. The Horseshoe Hammond and Mohegan Sun have one allegedly, and at least a few of the AC properties (Bally's, Caesars, and Borgata come to mind) and the high-end Vegas properties (Caesars, Bellagio, Wynn) still have them.

They aren't taxing table games at 67%, yes 67%, like Maryland is for slot machines, right? If so, I don't see how they can run blackjack without a $50 minimum with these approved rules.
