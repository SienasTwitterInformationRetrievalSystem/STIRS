Home » News » Wisconsin Wisconsin Law requiring carbon monoxide detectors goes into effect Feb. 1 Wisconsin rule is extended to one- and two-family homes By Jesse Garza of the Journal Sentinel Jan. 30, 2011 Tweet Email Print (15) Comments There's a danger lurking in many Wisconsin homes, serious enough for the state Legislature to pass a law. This assailant often strikes its victims as they sleep, sickening hundreds in Wisconsin each year. "What makes carbon monoxide so dangerous is the fact that it's colorless, tasteless and odorless," Milwaukee Fire Department Deputy Chief Randall Zingler said. "You can't see it, feel it or hear it, and if it's there when you go to sleep, you might not wake up." Beginning Tuesday, a new state law takes effect requiring carbon monoxide, or CO, alarms to be installed in all one- and two-family dwellings, according to the state Department of Health Services. The detectors work like smoke alarms, alerting the dwelling's occupants to dangerously high levels of carbon monoxide. Newly constructed homes will require detectors that are directly wired to the home's electrical service; owners of existing homes may use battery-powered, stand-alone detectors, according to the department. State law now includes a similar requirement for multifamily dwellings as well as any public building that is used for sleeping or lodging purposes. Carbon monoxide is a gas that can be emitted from poorly functioning or unvented furnaces or other gas-powered home appliances. Outdoor appliances such as portable generators, heaters and stoves also can create dangerous levels of CO in cabins, campers, tents, and hunting and fishing shacks. In Milwaukee, all too often outdoor appliances are used indoors by people to heat their homes when their utilities have been shut off, creating the danger of carbon monoxide poisoning, Zingler said. Often, however, carbon monoxide leaks result from wear and tear on furnace ventilation pipes that allows the gas to escape into a home, Zingler said. Other sources of elevated CO in homes include clogged chimneys and gas kitchen stoves that are used as a source of heat, he said. There also have been reported instances of carbon monoxide from vehicle engines seeping into homes from attached garages. "CO is basically caused by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels," Zingler said. Older homes are more susceptible to carbon monoxide leaks, he said. State health officials recommend that the detectors be installed on every level of a home and near sleeping areas. Zingler also recommends they be placed as high as possible because carbon monoxide tends to rise when it escapes. The Milwaukee Fire Department responded to 164 confirmed incidents of elevated levels of carbon monoxide in 2010, according to department data. In 2009, the latest year for which such statistics are available, hospital emergency rooms in Wisconsin treated 480 patients for CO poisoning, according to the state health department. According to data from by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission released in September 2009, between 2004 and 2006, carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in the United States resulting from heating systems and gas water heaters averaged 54 a year. Carbon monoxide alarms, some of which come with smoke detectors, are relatively inexpensive. A First Alert plug-in CO detector with a battery backup lists for $25.97 on the Walmart website, and a combination CO/smoke detector manufactured by Kidde lists for $19.99 on the site. The devices are available at many other retail outlets, Zingler said. Another reason carbon monoxide is potentially so dangerous is the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning - headache, fatigue, nausea, dizziness and vomiting - can be associated with common illnesses, which raises the importance of detectors in the home, Zingler said. If a carbon monoxide alarm goes off, people should not open windows, because that makes it more difficult for responders to find the source of the leak, he said. "Get everyone out of the house and call 911," Zingler said. © 2014, Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved. 15 Comments » Read and share your thoughts on this story.

This new law expands the current carbon monoxide detector requirements to all one and two-family homes and parallels requirements for smoke alarms for ease of installation. This new law will require carbon monoxide alarms to be installed in the basement of the dwelling and on each floor level except the attic or storage area of both newly constructed and existing homes. For new construction, the alarms must be hard-wired in order to be current with national model safety codes. For existing homes, the alarms can be battery operated and can be multi purpose (smoke and carbon monoxide). Dwellings with no attached garages, no fireplaces and no fuel-burning fireplaces are exempted from this requirement. Similar to the smoke alarm law, the new carbon monoxide detector law does not have a fine or penalty associated with non-compliance. However, all home inspections will be required to check for carbon monoxide alarms.  If a carbon monoxide incident happens in your home without the detector, your insurance may not cover the claim.  That’s a very unsettling thought, so be smart by being safe!   City of Milwaukee residents can call the Smoke Detector Hotline for more information.  The hotline number is 414-286-8980.   Carbon Monoxide (CO) is an odorless that can cause sudden illness and death. CO is found in flammable fumes, such as those produced in vehicles, small gasoline engines, lanterns, gas ranges, and heating systems; just to name a few. All people and animals are at risk of CO poisoning, but certain groups like infants and those with certain medical issues susceptible to the effects. To learn more about Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning, you can visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) website.

The New Wisconsin Carbon Monoxide Law Governor Jim Doyle signed the Wisconsin Carbon Monoxide law on March 13, 2010. This new law requires CO detector in all single family and duplex type residences. The effective date for this is February 1, 2011. You can view the entire text of the law here. How to comply? The law states that all bedrooms must have a unit installed in a common area with 21 feet of each bedroom. The law also requires a unit on each level of the home in a common area, like a hallway or family room. Carbon Monoxide Kills Just a week before the new law was to go into effect an 88 year old Auburn, WI man and his dog were found dead in their home. The culprit was faulty furnace that was spewing this odorless gas in to the home. So without a detection device it's very difficult to realize the problem before it's too late. This type of tragedy occurs about 200 times a year in the Untied States. What do I need to protect myself?

  Departments > Fire > Safety > Carbon Monoxide Home Departments Services           Live Work Visit Government Carbon Monoxide Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, highly toxic gas that is undetectable to the human senses. It is a by-product of combustion, present whenever fuel is burned: wood, natural gas, gasoline, diesel fuel, oil, coal, charcoal, propane, kerosene, etc. Here are some things that you should know about CO: Carbon monoxide displaces oxygen in the blood, which causes the brain, heart, muscles, tissues and organs to become oxygen starved. Being an odorless gas, victims may become disoriented before they are aware that they are in any danger, not allowing them to call for help or exit the premises. Symptoms can mimic a common cold, a hangover, food poisoning, depression, or flu (without body ache or fever). If you or any of your family members suspect an illness due to carbon monoxide call 911. Most commonly carbon monoxide poisoning comes from the malfunction of the following household appliances: gas stove, gas clothes dryer, furnace, gas water heater and a fireplace. This usually could be avoided with the proper installation, maintenance (which includes yearly inspections) and the proper usage of the appliance. The best way to protect you and your family is to have a UL approved carbon monoxide detector installed on every level of your home.  Carbon monoxide detectors along with smoke alarms and fire extinguishers are the most important life safety devices that no home should be without.  Wisconsin’s new carbon monoxide (CO) law will help ensure safe homes with the presence of CO alarms. But Fire and Carbon Monoxide Prevention starts with education about this new law.   WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW All single family and two-unit homes – new and existing – must install a CO alarm on every floor level, near sleeping areas. New construction must be hard-wired with a battery back-up. Existing homes may install any type of CO alarms; battery, plug-in, or combination smoke/CO devices. A carbon monoxide detector required under this section shall bear an Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., listing mark. The law took effect February 1, 2011. Alarms should be installed in accordance with directions from manufacturer. EXCEPTIONS CO alarms are only required in new and existing homes that have any fuel burning appliance, which includes: stoves, ovens, grills, clothes dryers, furnaces, boilers, water heaters, fireplaces and heaters OR an attached garage. Alarms do not need to be installed in the attic, garage or storage area of homes. MAINTENANCE Test alarms monthly. Replace alarms according to manufacturer instructions.
