Kim Kardashian loves experimenting with her fashion, especially since dating rapper-turned-designer Kanye West, but she has taken her maternity looks to a whole new level — even though her pregnancy outfits aren’t always the most flattering! But an insisder reveals that Kim is having fun with her maternity fashion, and there’s a reason she’s dressing so outside of the box! “Kim’s body type is very difficult to dress, and wearing loose-fitting maternity clothing will turn her into a box,” a source close to the mom-to-be tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “She’s trying to embrace her curves, and it’s become a trial-and-error process,” the source added. “She’s been trying to have fun with it.’ Kim Kardashian Admits: I Struggle With My Maternity Fashion Kim took to her blog to discuss why her pregnancy looks have been so all over the place throughout her second trimester. “I’ve found that I’ve gained inches and I’ve gotten wider, but my belly hasn’t popped yet, so I struggle finding things that don’t make me look heavy,” she wrote on her blog. “Some days my baby bump really shows, and some days it doesn’t… so I never really know what I’m going to look like.” “I’m definitely having a lot of fun with my maternity fashion and love trying new things,” Kim added. “I want to share my pregnancy fashion tips with other expecting moms out there and I know it’s different for everyone; some women start showing sooner, others don’t start showing until later, but I want to share my own personal experiences with you guys along the way.” At least she’s having fun with it!

U̶̲̥̅̊ need t̶̲̥̅̊ợ̣̣̇̇̇ ђε̲̣̣̣̥Яε̲̣̣̣̥ a free cloth during dis period. Instead of her t̶̲̥̅̊ợ̣̣̇̇̇ Bƺ grateful of her pregnancy she will rather complain forgetting that there are thousands of women who wish t̶̲̥̅̊ợ̣̣̇̇̇ Bƺ pregnant like her. All d same U̶̲̥̅̊ still look beautiful t̶̲̥̅̊ợ̣̣̇̇̇ me  Reply Share this comment at Becci Dawson Posted at 5:32 PM on April 14, 2013   Why do people follow the kardashians? They do nothing, have no talent and the only reason they are on tv is because of their mother. Kim has been complaining about being pregnant since the 8th week saying it was sooooo hard being pregnant! She hasn’t been hospitalized or suffered morning sickness, she is just a vain silly selfish person who doesn’t think of the 10s of thousands of women who can’t have kids and would love every minute of being pregnant! Please stop giving these nobodies attention because your buying into the advertising and making them rich!  Reply Share this comment at shuaishuai888 Posted at 8:27 PM on March 26, 2013   :) Kim Kardashian is a unique pregnant mom. I appreciate her life style and do thing ways.  Reply Share this comment at Brooksie1 Posted at 3:08 PM on March 20, 2013   Once your belly “pops” it doesn’t go back in. I am a mother of 4 and other than looking like I was gaining weight, I didn’t show with my 1st pregnancy until after 6 months. I woke up one morning with a big ol bump, that didn’t go away until after the baby was born. And there’s no way a pregnant woman can tolerate anything remotely tight around her waist. I also had a pregnancy mask with 1 of my children and your whole face gets wide…not just your lips. I still am not convinced that Kim is pregnant. I don’t believe a word that comes out of her mouth!  Reply Share this comment at yvonne jimenez Posted at 10:01 AM on March 15, 2013   WHAT EVER KIM WEAR;S SHE WILL STILL HAVE BEAUTY, HER FACE SKIN HER HAIR WITH MAKE UP OR NOT SHE IS VERY PRETTY. SHE TAKES AFTER HER MOM WHO IS PRETTY ALSO. I LOVE THEM .BIG FAN ALWAYS .  Reply Share this comment at jjinfl Posted at 4:00 PM on March 14, 2013   Well, I’m glad she continues to “have fun” looking like a stuffed sausage. OMG, I desperately hope she does not go through with her plan to share any of her amazing “maternity clothing tips” with other women, who probably look 10 times better than she does by using their own good taste. If she considers herself a fashionista and mentor for others on what to wear and when to wear it, she has missed the boat by a mile.  Reply Share this comment at kevin Posted at 3:02 PM on March 14, 2013   she looks so beatiful  Reply Share this comment at abe is doing it!!?

Wed, March 27, 2013 12:45pm EDT by Katrina Mitzeliotis 21 Comments Courtesy of New York Post There’s no denying the fact that Kim has showed off a slew of questionable styles while adjusting to her pregnant figure, but it looks like she’s getting bashed worse than ever — and this is taking it too far! In fact, our experts actually say Kim’s latest look is a step in the right direction. Kim Kardashian showed off three different looks in one day while in NYC on Mar. 26, promoting her role in Temptation, but it was her style choices that really had everyone talking. In fact, a belted, nude dress with a full skirt landed the pregnant reality star on the cover of the New York Post with the headline, “What The Frock?” While we have been very vocal about Kim’s questionable maternity style, we were so happy to finally see the 32-year-old mom-to-be embrace a looser silhouette. Personally, I think the bashing is really getting out of control! Kim admitted that she struggled with figuring out how to handle all the changes brought on by her pregnancy — and it looks like that includes how to dress her baby bump! Clearly sticking to form-fitting, high-waisted silhouettes wasn’t in her best interest, which is why we were pleasantly surprised to see the star step out in a nude frock with a full skirt when she arrived for an appearance on Live with Kelly and Michael — it looks like she’s finally getting the hang of her maternity style! Kim Kardashian Maternity Clothes: Experts Weigh In: Nina Garcia, creative director at Marie Claire, exclusively told HollywoodLife, “In the next couple of months, Kim’s body will be changing and the proportions of her silhouettes will have to be tweaked. My style advice for her is to keep it monochromatic, simple, and streamlined with fabrics that have stretch and can highlight her curves,” she said. “This season, she is lucky that Spring is all about long flowy dresses and flats—and both would make her look very cool, like a goddess. Designers like Donna Karan always have clothes that have a bit of stretch, which is majorly important. It is not about trying so hard. Keep it simple, keep it comfortable and stay confident!” Celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch added, “Kim is really carrying in her hips as opposed to someone like Jessica Simpson who is mainly carrying in her stomach. Kim can show more cleavage or something tighter on top so she can still be sexy without accentuating her hips even more. A great option is a fuller skirt with a cardigan or pairing a tunic with flowy pants or leggings. For once she can not show off so much of her notorious ba-donk-a-donk and proudly show off her baby bump,” he said. Wearing a looser silhouette and embracing a monochromatic look is exactly what Kim did on this occasion — and the empire waist is so much more flattering on the star! Sure, she should retire her collection of belts sooner rather than later, but from head-to-toe Kim kept it simple and looked confident in her ensemble — so what’s what with all the fuss? Enough Is Enough! Kim’s body is obviously growing as she gains weight and her figure changes — and all of this is totally normal for the mom-to-be! Kim has managed to fall under scrutiny even worse than Jessica Simpson did during her first pregnancy — and I think the criticism is out of control. Enough is enough! Don’t get me wrong, Kim’s difficulty to leave her sexy style and affinity for form-fitting silhouettes behind is the cause for all of the backlash, but at the end of the day why are we constantly ripping a pregnant woman apart for her fashion choices? Let’s get real, we all roll our eyes when we hear celebs gush about how much they love their changing body and how quickly they bounced back after giving birth, but now that Kim is very publicly struggling with the changes, (like I’m sure many women do), we’re quick to slam her, one outfit at a time. I don’t know about you, but I’m honestly SO sick of talking about Kim’s maternity style. Sure, I’m sick of seeing her in high-waisted silhouettes and belts, but I’m also sick of seeing everyone play fashion police and rip the pregnant star apart. What do you think? Do you think Kim’s latest dress should be considered a major fashion offense or do you think everyone is taking it a little too far?

Like someone said, she puts these clothes on and struts around in public to be photographed. The thing I can’t understand is how she thinks she looks good in these clothes! She wouldn’t look good in half of the stuff she is wearing even if she wasn’t pregnant! I loved being pregnant so I could wear stretchy clothes and loose fitting stuff. She looks more fat than pregnant and if she had real stylists, someone would be telling her that. There’s a way to make your baby belly look cute, and then there is this. And what was that pic of her wearing Spanx while pregnant?! SERIOUSLY?  Reply Share this comment at JJ Posted at 2:31 PM on March 27, 2013   Her tight clothing is going to hurt the baby. What kind of mother is she going to be if she can’t even make the right decisions for her baby while it’s still in her stomach totally 100% reliant on her actions.  Reply Share this comment at jimmie c Posted at 2:15 PM on March 27, 2013   A riot! Not one ounce of sympathy for this woman who made millions from performing filthy sex acts on a sex taple; staging a fake wedding and now pregnant while still married to another man.

Why can’t she just look like other normally-developing pregnant women and give up the “Look at me, I’m a sexpot” look? She should check out some photos of the lovely English duchess Kate Middleton, who looks elegant, comfortable, regal, and happy with her pregnancy.  Reply Share this comment at ann roberts Posted at 4:05 PM on March 27, 2013   agree  Reply Share this comment at Stacey Posted at 1:32 PM on March 27, 2013   MAJOR fashion offense.

Her resilience is amazing. Amy Odell BuzzFeed Staff posted about a year ago 1. Wear white pantsuits that make you look like you’ve been whipped to stiff peaks. View this image › Frazer Harrison / Getty Images If you’re not Mary J. Blige and you’re wearing a white pantsuit you have to be wary of looking like you’re trying to be Mary J. Blige. With the excess fabric draping here, Kim avoids looking like a Mary knockoff WHILE distinguishing herself from her boyfriend’s all-white (see below). 2. Don’t be afraid to let your man shine white like a diamond. View this image › Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images And wear all-black. It’s not like people won’t notice you, but it never hurts to act like you don’t care if they don’t by wearing clothes that make you fade into the surroundings, like an octopus on the sea bottom. No matter what, uncomfortable shoes are a must. 3. Channel the 2000s in Grecian-style, spaghetti strap wrap dresses. View this image › Jason Kempin / Getty Images The important thing is to not remind people of eras prior to your inexplicable rise to mega fame, no matter how much everyone loves the ’90s right now. 4. Wear fitted leather whenever possible. View this image › Chelsea Lauren / Getty Images Nothing will quite prepare your growing fetus for the badass life it’s expected to lead — and the black leather diapers it’s expected to wear — like a mom who wears enough tight leather to cause people to wonder if it’s fused with her skin. 5. Instead of tights, wear leather leggings. View this image › Todd Williamson / AP This saves you the bother of getting elaborately feathered skirts lengthened. What expecting working mom has time for THAT? 6. Comfort should never be a priority, really. View this image › Jason Merritt / Getty Images Multi-textured outfits should ALWAYS be a priority, however. 7. Assert your MILF-ness by wearing see-through blouses in the middle of winter — in Canada. View this image › Mike Ridewood / Getty Images This is what Kim wore on January 4 in Calgary, just days after announcing her and Kanye’s future spawn. Note how the trendy see-through blouse and gladiator stilettos separate her look from your average lawyer’s daywear. 8. Hide your growing bump under the most elaborate trousers you can find. View this image › FAMEFLYNET PICTURES Like peplum green leopard-print skinnies. Or just wrap an oversized scrunchie around your midsection in case the store runs out of these (…). 9. Wear plastic stiletto shoes with the most unforgiving pencil skirt you can find. View this image › FAMEFLYNET PICTURES Nothing taxes a stylist’s brain like a white outfit that’s so tight you can’t even fit a slip underneath. Well, aside from aforementioned peplum “pants,” one presumes. View this image › Via http://FAMEFLYNET%20PICTURES I’m afraid those red marks on her ankles are welts from her gladiator shoe-booties. This woman is a warrior of clothes, you can say that much. 10. Indulge in a caftan every so often. View this image › FAMEFLYNET PICTURES But make sure people know you’re edgy by wearing chest cut-outs. Call up Rachel Zoe after the pictures come out and make sure you did the outfit right. 11. Before you let yourself get too comfortable, slither into a skintight black tank dress with some eye-catching boobdazzling. View this image › Brooks This is what they call “night to day dressing.” 12. Shun opaque fabrics in favor of fishing net with strategically placed semi-opaque cutouts. View this image › Denise Truscello / WireImage Think of this dress as “all-over pasties.” 13. Indulge in loose, leather-trimmed pants at airports only. View this image › Olivia Salazar / WireImage But your mundane, everyperson airport activities must also be done in the most uncomfortable, airport-unfriendly shoes. 14. Dress up this fancy to shop. View this image › Marc Piasecki / FilmMagic Obviously you will be frequenting Paris’s Balenciaga boutique instead of A Pea in the Pod. 15. Experiment with sideboob cut-outs. View this image › Ray Tamarra / Getty Images Of course you’ll need to find an impeccable tailor that can build breast support into all your clothes so you won’t have to worry about normal-person underwear, like bras. 16. Jazz up an otherwise bland outfit with statement stilettos. View this image › Donna Ward / Getty Images You know, the kind of puzzling shoes that show that you’re taking your boyfriend’s fashion hobby seriously. That means never looking like your name is all over a line of Sears clothing. 17. Dress for the weather, but only on certain parts of your body. View this image › Marc Piasecki / FilmMagic When going out in January in Paris like Kim here, wear fur on your wrists, but leave your feet exposed to the elements. And again: tight leather wherever possible, please. 18. Create the illusion of comfort by wrapping a large plaid shirt around your waist. View this image › SMXRF/Star Max / FilmMagic 19. Vanquish that illusion as soon as people see what your shoes look like in broad daylight. View this image › SMXRF/Star Max / FilmMagic 20. As your due date nears, try wearing your favorite leggings under a glamorous sparkly mourning robe. View this image › Chris McKay / WireImage Now that she’s crossing over into film, the symbolism may be appropriate.

I feel like I'm back to my old self and I'm so happy! With this being my first pregnancy I've been finding it really difficult to find clothes that are comfortable and fit me well, but these are great. The reality star, due in July with her first baby (with beau Kanye West, just in case you've been living under a rock), is between four and five months pregnant. As a fashion editor, I've always been, erm, interested in Kardashian's style. But as a style writer who has experienced two healthy pregnancies and the body changes that are par for the course, my interest in Kim has piqued. Will she maintain her signature look -- sky-high heels, sheer, bra-baring tops and body-conscious dresses -- as her body grows and changes? After four months of deliberation, I can tell you the answer: Yes, she will continue to dress like a Kardashian. But she's going to experience a few hurdles along the way, and I'm only too delighted to point out the missteps she's taken so far ... if only to, you know, help guide her throughout the rest of her pregnancy. 1. The first few months are tough, so being comfortable should be your first priority. There's morning sickness and exhaustion to contend with, coupled with weight gain in unexpected places. It's as if Mother Nature wants you to store fat for the baby any place you possibly can (including your heretofore toned upper arms). This all happens as you are trying to keep the pregnancy under wraps, just adding another level of difficulty to an already challenging time. This is not the time to wear body-conscious bandage dresses. Nor is it the time to try to reign in lumps and bumps with Spanx, as you're probably feeling pretty terrible as it is. An extra layer of industrial-strength Lycra is the last thing you need. 2. Your boobs will get exponentially bigger -- support them. This is a good thing, except for the fact that they hurt like hell. Like going-over-speed-bumps-is-excruciating kind of pain. This is when you start wearing two sports bras to sleep in order to minimize any movement. We have seen Kim out in keyhole dresses where support definitely wasn't the motivating factor. Take it from me, Kim: Your breasts are about to go through Hades. Take care of them now, or they'll be in your shoes in a few years. 3. Actually, your whole body will get bigger, so avoid voluminous shapes. The thing with trendy, fashion-forward pieces like peplums is that they add extra material to your silhouette. I don't know about you, but the last thing I want when my butt is exploding out of my jeans is to add a few ruffles to the area. You may as well grab a giant foam finger and point it to the area in question while exclaiming, "Hey, look! I'm getting big, y'all!" 4. Emphasize the positive. I refer you back to number two. Your breasts will grow, so show them off (while supporting them). No one will look at your unbuttoned jeans if you can offer them a tasteful view of your enhanced décolletage. In the same vein, go ahead and show off your legs, because they are probably one of the few body parts that you can be sure won't change too much over the course of your pregnancy. 5. Let loose. Embrace a loose top to camouflage that growing belly. Kim hit the nail on the head when she wore loose silk trousers with a casual shirt, but added a sleek blazer and heels to keep her look sophisticated and tailored, while allowing room to breathe. Once Kim's baby bump really starts to pop (which, for some women, doesn't happen until the sixth month of their first pregnancy), we say show it off in fitted T-shirts and body-conscious (but stretchy!) dresses. But until then, resist the urge to wear those Hervé Leger bandage dresses. Your bump will thank you. Check out Kim's maternity style thus far.

And Kim Kardashian got it spectacularly wrong when she stepped out in a pair of garish snakeskin peplum trousers on Friday whilst leaving her Beverly Hills mansion. The patterned attire failed to flatter the 32-year-old's pregnancy curves with their ill fit and frilled waistband. A fright in frills: Kim Kardashian stepped out in a pair of garish snakeskin peplum trousers on Friday Odd ensemble: Kim started out her day by stepping out of her Beverly Hills mansion in the odd ensemble Kim paired the ensemble with a similarly unflattering turtleneck black sweater, which showed off a hint of her midriff. The tight top was a little on the small side for the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, whose figure continues to blossom as she gets nearer to her due date. The brunette star once again pared down her accessories by wearing just a simple pair of black suede heels on her feet and oversized diamond earrings in her ears. A size too small? Kim paired the ensemble with a similarly unflattering turtleneck black sweater, which showed off a hint of her midriff In charge: Kim was later seen arriving at a production company in Toluca Lake to oversee her reality show Not so flattering: The patterned attire failed to flatter the 32-year-old's pregnancy curves with their ill fit and frilled waistband She wore her chocolate locks out in a wavy style, parting her tresses at the side. The odd outfit is the second one in a row for the reality mogul. Kim stepped out in a monochrome dress on Thursday which showed that there was no hiding the fact that a Kardashian baby is on its way. Kim, who has more than four months to go in her pregnancy, looked extremely curvy in the black and white attire. Minimalist: The brunette star once again pared down her accessories by wearing just a simple pair of black suede heels on her feet Baby steps: Kim was careful as she hopped into her chauffeured car ahead of her meeting Kim has always been known for her curvacious figure, but now she is expecting a baby - with rapper boyfriend Kanye West - the Keeping Up With The Kardashians has taken her curves to a whole new level. From the front of the dress Kim's growing bump was obscured, but from the side there was no missing it. Seen leaving her home earlier in the day in the black and white spliced ensemble, the reality mogul paired the dress with more monochrome in the form of white stilettos and a simple black leather clutch. Experimental: Kim has been experimenting with her pregnancy style since announcing that she is expecting her first child Monochrome: Kim stepped out in a monochrome dress on Thursday which showed that there was no hiding the fact that a Kardashian baby is on its way Kim allowed a pop of colour by wearing lashings of bright red lipstick on her famous pout and slicked her hair back into a tight bun. The outfit and the hair and make-up gave her a high fashion look that is slowly becoming her style since she started dating Kanye. Since the pair started dating, she began stepping out in several edgy and haute couture ensembles, many of which failed to flatter her figure. Ying and Yang: Seen leaving her home earlier in the day in the black and white spliced ensemble, the reality mogul paired the dress with more monochrome in the form of white stilettos and a simple black leather clutch Most assumed that the rapper was influencing her style and in one episode of her hit reality series, Keeping Up With The Kardashian, he was even seen dressing his girlfriend. In a new interview with Us Weekly, Kim admits that she does try to please the Gold Digger star in the way she dresses. 'I dress for my man way more than for myself,' she says. He (Kanye) likes cool, drapey things. Very casual.' The brunette star says these days she definitely sways towards more monochrome shades. 'Mine is definitely more sleek, sophisticated and very monochrome these days,' she explains.
