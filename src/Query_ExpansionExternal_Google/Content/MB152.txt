The Icelandic Minister of Interior, Ögmundur Jónasson, has confirmed this to the Icelandic press and furthermore stated that when he found out on August 25th 2011 that the aim of the visit was to interrogate an Icelandic citizen he ordered the local police to cease all co-operation with the FBI. He indicated that the FBI had left the country the day after. In a joint statement Monday from the Icelandic Police Chief and the Prosecutor General it is revealed that the FBI agents, in fact, did not leave the country immediately and were conducting interrogation of an Icelandic subject for at least five days, without the presence of Icelandic police officers. The person in question was a 18 year old individual who had offered his assistance to WikiLeaks as a volunteer. For a period of some months he did manage several minor tasks for the organisation as one of hundreds of volunteers all over the world assisting the organisation. Many of them have visited Julian Assange as did the person in question in the summer of 2011. A Canadian volunteer contacted the young Icelander with the idea of raising funds for WikiLeaks with online sales of T-shirts, coffee mugs and other merchandise. It later emerged that the Icelander deceived the Canadian volunteer into believing that he was WikiLeaks staff in order to have the funds transferred to his personal account instead of the organisations. When confronted, he admitted the wrongdoing. Because of requests from people close to him and his young age he was offered the opportunity to repay the stolen funds, which amounted to about $50,000. When it became clear he would not honour the agreement the matter was reported to the Icelandic Police. WikiLeaks has learned that the police have finished the investigation and that the matter has been sent to the police prosecutor. It has also been reported that the police are processing charges of embezzlement against the individual pertaining to a number of other organisations within Iceland unrelated to WikiLeaks. It has materialized that the individual has engaged in gross misrepresentations of different types to obtain benefit from a range of parties. We will not identify him by name in light of information that he has recently received institutional medical treatment. In light of the relentless ongoing persecution of U.S. authorities against WikiLeaks it is not surprising that the FBI would try to abuse this troubled young man and involve him in some manner in the attempt to prosecute WikiLeaks staff. It is an indication of the great length these entities are willing to go that they will disrespect the sovereignty of other nations in their endeavor. There is strong indication that the FBI used a combination of coercion and payments to pressure the young man to co-operate. For further background, see: http://icelandreview.com/icelandrev...

Skip to main content The Big Story Search form Search Sections Home Latest News Minister: Iceland refused to help FBI on WikiLeaks By RAPHAEL SATTER — Feb. 1, 2013 1:29 PM EST You are here Home » Iceland » Minister: Iceland refused to help FBI on WikiLeaks Share Tweet Tumblr By: Raphael Satter ( AP) LONDON Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. 51.5085 -0.12574 LONDON (AP) — Iceland's interior minister said Friday that he ordered the country's police not to cooperate with FBI agents sent to investigate WikiLeaks two years ago, offering a rare glimpse into the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation of the secret-busting site. Ogmundur Jonasson told The Associated Press that he was upset when he found out that FBI agents had flown to the country to interview an unidentified WikiLeaks associate in August 2011. "I, for one, was not aware that they were coming to Iceland," he said in a brief telephone interview. "When I learned about it, I demanded that Icelandic police cease all cooperation and made it clear that people interviewed or interrogated in Iceland should be interrogated by Icelandic police." Jonasson said that Icelandic diplomats protested the FBI's trip to their U.S. counterparts. "We made clear to the American authorities that this was not well-seen by us," he said. The exact purpose of the FBI's trip to Iceland isn't clear — the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavik referred questions to the FBI, and the bureau did not immediately return an email seeking comment — but the tiny north Atlantic nation has been a key hub for WikiLeaks and its supporters. In 2010 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange helped craft Iceland's journalist-friendly media law, and WikiLeaks payment processor, DataCell, is based in Reykjavik. Several key allies, including lawmaker Birgitta Jonsdottir and WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, are also from the country. Hrafnsson said in a telephone interview that he believed the target of the FBI's trip might have been a former WikiLeaks volunteer, whom he declined to name. Regardless of what the target was, the minister's account of the FBI's trip opens a window into a sensitive inquiry which has so far remained largely under wraps. The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating WikiLeaks since it began pouring classified U.S. documents into the public domain, but officials have refused to reveal almost any information about the size, scope, or nature of their inquiry, citing national security concerns. ___ Online: Raphael Satter can be reached at: http://raphae.li/twitter Share Tweet Tumblr Tags Julian Assange, Iceland, Reykjavik Comments View the discussion thread.

The Icelandic Interior Minister said he ordered police to cease contact with the FBI, and made it clear their presence was not “well-seen” in Iceland. Interior Minister Ogmundur Jonasson informed the AP of his displeasure upon discovering that FBI agents had arrived in the country in August 2011. Minister Jonasson revealed the story to AP on Friday, two days after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange announced he would run for senator in the Australian elections in September.   "I, for one, was not aware that they were coming to Iceland," Jonasson said in a brief telephone interview. "When I learned about it, I demanded that Icelandic police cease all cooperation and made it clear that people interviewed or interrogated in Iceland should be interrogated by Icelandic police."  "We made clear to the American authorities that this was not well-seen by us," Jonasson added. The principal aim of the FBI foray into the North Atlantic nation was to interview an unidentified WikiLeaks associate. Iceland has been a key stronghold for WikiLeaks and its supporters since the site launched. Assange, who is currently holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, signed the country’s journalist-friendly media law in 2010 with a view to making Iceland a haven for freedom of speech. WikiLeaks bankroller DataCell is also based in Reykjavik, along with other key supporters of the whistleblowing organization. ­ A rare insight The Icelandic Interior Minister’s announcement provides a rare insight into the US investigation launched against the whistleblowing website after it started to leak classified US diplomatic cables. The US Department of Justice has refused to comment on its investigation into WikiLeaks' activities. However, Assange believes that the US will be forced to drop its investigation eventually because of “the building of political opposition to the persecution of a media organization.” On Wednesday, Assange confirmed that he would be running for a seat in the Senate in Australia’s September elections. However, the whistleblower has now been held up for over six months in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, and is wanted for questioning over charges of sexual assault in Sweden. Assange has repeatedly voiced concerns that if he is extradited to Sweden, he will be handed over to the US where he has been classified as an enemy of the state. “One gets used to things. Other people are in much harsher conditions than I am…[the embassy] is certainly preferable to solitary confinement in Sweden or the United States,” he told press in December.

Angered that agents from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) traveled to his country unannounced in an attempt to investigate the whistleblower website Wikileaks, Iceland's interior minister had the Americans deported. The Associated Press reports that Ogmundur Jonasson was caught off guard when he learned that FBI agents came to Iceland to question an unidentified Wikileaks associate in August 2011. "I, for one, was not aware that they were coming to Iceland," Jonasson told the AP.

Swedish court upholds warrant against WikiLeaks founder FBI details 2007 Blackwater killings Assange asked to model at London Fashion Week "The FBI arrived in private planes and landed at the Reykjavik airport... News of the visit reached [Interior Minister] Ögmundur Jónasson, who reacted sharply, as it was unbelievably presumptuous to come to Iceland that way... Jónasson demanded that the FBI agents pack their bags, get back on board, and leave the country. The matter was then brought before the cabinet and a formal protest was issued to US authorities." Iceland has been a safe haven for Wikileaks activity. The Economist Intelligence Unit ranks the Nordic island nation of 320,000 as the world's 2nd most democratic, after Norway, and Icelanders pride themselves on their reputation for free speech. Wikileaks worked with Icelandic lawmakers to draft the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative (IMMI), a "parliamentary resolution... tasking the government with implementing various protections" to create a safe haven for journalists and to guarantee free speech in the digital age. The IMMI was passed by a vote of 50-0 in June 2010. The United States government was not pleased by Iceland's embrace of Wikileaks. Although the whistleblowing website has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for promoting peace by holding governments accountable for their actions, the Bush administration was infuriated that site leaked proof of US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Obama administration, which has protected the Bush officials responsible for torture and other crimes, has targeted Wikileaks and its fugitive founder Julian Assange. Leading conservatives have been particularly venomous in their condemnation of Wikileaks; former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has joined Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in calling for Assange's execution, while former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said he should be hunted down like Osama bin Laden. Rep. Steve King (R-NY) asked former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder to designate Wikileaks a "foreign terrorist organization" and Assange a "terrorist ringleader." article:342639:57::0 Share on Facebook       More about Iceland, Wikileaks, FBI More news from Iceland Wikileaks FBI More from World Air Algerie Flight AH5017 reportedly crashes with 110 passengers, 6 crew 'World's Saddest Bear' to remain in sweltering hot Argentine Zoo Warning of 'imminent' terror attack in Norway Gunmen kill two Finnish women in western Afghanistan ISIS leader demands female genital mutilation of 2 million girls   Social Comments ()   Digital Journal Comments (14) Latest News Top News Astronomy: Most precise measurement of exoplanet to date Panic!

Checking for new content Loading new content Democracy Now! HOME TOPICS DONATE Fri Feb 1, 2013 Report: FBI Agents Flew to Iceland to Investigate WikiLeaks An Icelandic media report has revealed new details about U.S. attempts to investigate the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson told the broadcaster RUV that FBI agents landed in Reykjavik in 2011 without warning in a bid to investigate WikiLeaks operations inside Iceland. But the country’s home secretary ordered the agents to leave. Iceland then reportedly lodged a formal protest against the FBI’s action with U.S. authorities. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeatedly voiced fears he could face U.S. prosecution after the site published troves of classified material revealing U.S. abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as diplomatic cables. Assange remains in the Ecuadorean embassy in London in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden and ultimately, he says, to the United States. prev view list next Back to Top ↑ RSS & Podcasts Contact FOLLOW US Amy's Column Web Exclusives GET INVOLVED EVENTS Full Site DONATE CLOSE Dear Visitor: We are an independent, ad-free daily news program that serves millions of viewers and listeners each month.

Iceland prides itself on its support for free speech, and is effectively a WikiLeaks-friendly nation. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, still blockaded within the Ecuadorian embassy in London, helped Iceland craft its media-friendly International Modern Media Institute (IMMI) project. This is developing a series of laws that are expected to be implemented within the Icelandic constitution, including whistleblower protection, freedom of information, journalist source protection, limiting prior restraint and protecting intermediaries (such as ISPs who are ‘mere conduits’). Two years ago FBI agents traveled unannounced to Iceland. According to WikiLeaks spokesperson in Iceland, Kristinn Hrafnsson, interviewed by Iceland’s state broadcaster RUV, “The FBI arrived in private planes and landed at the Reykjavik airport... News of the visit reached [interior minister] Ögmundur Jónasson, who reacted sharply, as it was unbelievably presumptuous to come to Iceland that way... Jónasson demanded that the FBI agents pack their bags, get back on board, and leave the country. The matter was then brought before the cabinet and a formal protest was issued to US authorities.” The story only broke on Friday following a brief telephone conversation between the Associated Press and Jónasson. “I, for one, was not aware that they were coming to Iceland," he said. "When I learned about it, I demanded that Icelandic police cease all cooperation and made it clear that people interviewed or interrogated in Iceland should be interrogated by Icelandic police.” Neither who the FBI wished to interview, nor why the story has only just been made public is clear. The Pirate Times, however, believes it knows. Elected politician  Birgitta Jónsdóttir, the de facto leader of Iceland’s Pirate Party, is planning to travel to the US in early April. Jónsdóttir was instrumental in bringing out the WikiLeaks ‘collateral murder’ video and is a leading figure in the IMMI project. At the beginning of 2011 the US authorities subpoenaed Twitter to hand over data including her mailing addresses and billing information, connection records and session times, IP addresses used to access Twitter, and e-mail accounts. This happened, according to the Pirate Times, after the FBI/Jónasson incident. “There can be little doubt they (the FBI) were targeting Brigitta,” says the Pirate Times. It adds, “The Icelandic government and her own lawyers have strongly advised her not to go (to the US).” However, Jónsdóttir blogged on Friday, “I have decided that it is impossible to live my life in such a way that, as a member of parliament and of the electorate, I have to have such restrictions imposed on me so that I cannot enjoy the freedom to travel to a country that claims to be the land of the free,” (Pirate Time’s translation). Her intention is to demonstrate support for Bradley Manning. It would seem unlikely that simultaneous news of the FBI’s expulsion and news of Jónsdóttir’s planned visit to the US can be co-incidental, and may be an attempt to make the visit so high profile as to deter any action from the US authorities, despite their antipathy towards WikiLeaks and Bradley Manning.
