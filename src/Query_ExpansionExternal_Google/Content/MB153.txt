Constitutionally Speaking This blog deals with political and social issues in South Africa, mostly from the perspective of Constitutional Law. Written by Pierre de Vos Skip to Content ↓ About Bill of Rights Seminar Room Updates Oscar Pistorius and the granting of bail Feb 19th, 2013 by Pierre De Vos. The circumstances under which a court may grant bail to an accused person charged with a heinous crime are widely misunderstood in South Africa. Although the rules around the granting of bail are relative strict if compared to many other constitutional democracies, a court is not supposed to withhold bail merely in order to punish the accused or to demonstrate disapproval of alleged crime committed by the bail applicant. To do so would amount to a form of detention without trial, which was widely used during in the apartheid era against political opponents of the National Party regime. I fear that many South Africans considering the merits of granting bail to murder accused Oscar Pistorius will lose sight of this important fact. Section 35 of the Constitution states that every person arrested for allegedly committing a crime has the right to be brought to court (usually within 48 hours after arrest) and “to be released from detention if the interests of justice permit”. As the Constitutional Court explained in the 1999 case of S v Dlamini, S v Dladla and Others; S v Joubert; S v Schietekat, the question of whether it would be in the interest of justice to grant bail will focus “primarily on securing the attendance of the accused at trial and on preventing the accused from interfering with the proper investigation and prosecution of the case”. The Court then continued: The broad policy considerations contemplated by the “interests of justice” test … can legitimately include the risk that the detainee will endanger a particular individual or the public at large. Less obviously, but nonetheless constitutionally acceptably, a risk that the detainee will commit a fairly serious offence can be taken into account. The important proviso throughout is that there has to be a likelihood, i.e. a probability, that such risk will materialise. A possibility or suspicion will not suffice. At the same time, a finding that there is indeed such a likelihood is no more than a factor, to be weighed with all others, in deciding what the interests of justice are. In a bail application the enquiry is not primarily concerned with the question of the guilt of the accused. The focus at the bail stage is to decide whether the interest of justice permits the release of the accused pending trial. Bail will usually be denied to protect the investigation and prosecution of the case and to protect society against the possible future life threatening criminal acts of an accused. The bail provisions contained in section 60 of the Criminal Procedure Act must be interpreted and applied with reference to these human rights based policy considerations. It is not clear that our courts always make decisions on bail within the framework of these human rights centred policy considerations — especially in cases where an accused is poor or does not have legal representation. Section 60 of the Criminal Procedure Act states that a court can normally refuse bail “in the interest of justice” only where there is the likelihood that the accused, if he or she were released on bail, will endanger the safety of the public or any particular person; will evade his or her trial; will attempt to influence or intimidate witnesses or to conceal or destroy evidence; or if, in exceptional circumstances, there is the likelihood that the release of the accused will disturb the public order or undermine the public peace or security. But section 60(11) of the Criminal Procedure Act provides for an exception to this general rule. It states that where an accused is charged with planned or premeditated murder; with the killing of a police officer; with rape related offences; or with robbery with agravating circumstances (so called schedule 6 offences) the court must deny bail unless the accused can prove to the court that “exceptional circumstances exist which in the interests of justice permit his or her release”.  In such cases the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) can issue a written confirmation that he or she intends charging the accused with one of these schedule 6 offences, which the court considering bail will take as prima facie proof of the charge to be brought against the accused by the Prosecuting Authority. The bail hearing of Oscar Pistorius is based on this section, but because the NDPP did not issued a note confirming the schedule 6 charge, the court must first decide whether there is a significant likelihood that Pistorius will indeed be charged with “premeditated murder”. This concept of “premeditated murder” is not a legal category found in our general criminal law principles, as no distinction is made at the trial stage of the proceedings between premeditated murder and other forms of murder. The concept is relevant for considering bail and, again, after conviction, can play a role in determining the sentence of the convicted murderer. Premeditated or planned murder was described as follows by the Cape High Court in the case of S v Raath: Clearly the concept suggests a deliberate weighing-up of the proposed criminal conduct as opposed to the commission of the crime on the spur of the moment or in unexpected circumstances. There is, however, a broad continuum between the two poles of a murder committed in the heat of the moment and one which had been conceived and planned over months or even years before its execution… Only an examination of all the circumstances surrounding any particular murder, including not least the accused’s state of mind, will allow one to arrive at the conclusion as to whether a particular murder is ‘planned or premeditated’. In such an evaluation the period of time between the accused forming the intent to commit the murder and carrying out this intention is obviously of cardinal importance… This means that a court is not supposed to apply section 60(11) to a bail hearing where in the absence of a certificate from the NDPP where an accused person is suspected of killing someone else “on the spur of the moment”. Something more is required. When considering the constitutionality of this section of the Act in the Dlamini case, the Constitutional Court pointed out that the section makes it more difficult but not impossible for a court to grant bail to an accused who will be charged with premeditated murder. The section places “a formal onus” on the accused. This means the accused must actually produce evidence of “exceptional circumstances” and cannot merely rely on the alleged weaknesses in the evidence made by the state during the bail hearing. However, the Constitutional Court, in finding that this provision was not unconstitutional, watered down its application by watering down the meaning of “exceptional circumstances”. The onus still rests on the accused. But the Court said that the subsection does not require the accused to provide evidence of circumstances “above and beyond” those factors listed above: factors such as whether the accused will threaten the safety of the public; will pose a flight risk or will pose a risk to the investigation by, say, interfering with witnesses. As the Constitutional Court explained in the Dlamini case, an accused charged with a schedule 6 offence could establish that “exceptional circumstances” exist to grant bail by showing that “there are exceptional circumstances relating to the his or her emotional condition that render it in the interests of justice that release on bail be ordered notwithstanding the gravity of the case”. For example, continued the Court: an otherwise dependable man charged with consensual sexual intercourse with a fifteen year old girl, and who has a minor previous conviction dating back many years, would technically fall within the ambit of sub-s (11)(a). Yet a prudent judicial officer could find those circumstances sufficiently exceptional to warrant bail provided there were no other factors adverse to the grant. Applying these factors to a question of whether bail should be granted to an accused charged with premeditated murder, the question is not whether – based on the arguments presented by the state and the counter arguments presented by the legal representative of the accused – a court might have doubt about the innocence of the accused. The probability that Pistorius is either guilty or innocent is therefore not of primary importance in the considering whether he should be granted bail. What is of primary importance is whether his legal representative had provided evidence of exceptional circumstances that would demonstrate to the court that Pistorius had not been involved in similar crimes in the past, that he does not pose a flight risk or a threat to other members of the public and that he will not interfere with the investigation. If they had shown this, Pistorius should be granted bail. As is often the case when decisions about bail are made, the public (and it must be said, sometimes also the presiding officer) conflate their abhorrence of the alleged criminal act or their suspicions about whether the accused might eventually be found guilty of the crime, on the one hand, with the question of whether exceptional circumstances exist to grant bail, on the other. They then insist that bail should have been denied. This is often in conflict with the human rights based interpretation of the relevant section of the Criminal Procedure Act that was provided by the Constitutional Court. I know this is not a popular point to make. I am also aware that some people might wrongly believe that in pointing this out, I am demonstrating an insufficiently abhorrence of the crime that Pistorius is being charged with. But I would invoke the words of Justice Arthur Chaskalson in S v Makwanyane to answer this conceptually muddled charge: The very reason for establishing the new legal order, and for vesting the power of judicial review of all legislation in the courts, was to protect the rights of minorities and others who cannot protect their rights adequately through the democratic process. Those who are entitled to claim this protection include the social outcasts and marginalised people of our society. It is only if there is a willingness to protect the worst and the weakest amongst us, that all of us can be secure that our own rights will be protected.

JZ. regular seasonal blockbusters and now…… Days of our Lives – Episode two. ….. Ash Excellent explanation of the substantive requirements for bail in SA. Very informative, thanx Prof! Singh Oscar Pistorius is not someone who “cannot protect their rights adequately through the democratic process” or “social outcasts and marginalised people of our society”. He is the opposite of Justice Chaskalson’s intended target deserving of constitutional protection. This is a privileged white person, who overcome physical disabilities to earn R5,6m per annum. He can afford the best legal minds, pathologist and even an imported public relations expert. Leaving aside his ability to mount a sophisticated defence and PR campaign, the evidence not of the crime of murder itself but that he had a 9mm pistol under his bed and the ease with which he resorted to discharging at least four rounds should inform a reasonable person that Oscar Pistorius was and is a paranoid and mentally unstable person. He has this weapon (and others) whilst living in a R4m house located in a secure estate protected by armed security. [The fact that he had a 9mm pistol under his bed was stated in his affidavit today. In addition press reports indicate that he had access to a machine gun and cricket bat as well] Releasing him on bail would allow for a probability that he would pose a danger to society, himself and also interfere with the judicial process; which should be sacrosanct. It is thus not in the “interests of justice” to release him on bail. http://www.ozoneblue.co.za/ Ozoneblue Singh February 19, 2013 at 23:41 pm “This is a privileged white person, who overcome physical disabilities to earn R5,6m per annum.” But he did overcome didn’t he. Because he refused to sit back and claim victimhood. A man born without legs, running in a Olympic event. That must piss many advocates for pathetic “poor victimised us” mentality off. You go do that, claim a spot in the Olympics. I dare you and report back here just how easy that was. http://www.ozoneblue.co.za/ Ozoneblue “but that he had a 9mm pistol under his bed and the ease with which he resorted to discharging at least four rounds” That all sound perfectly rational to me. Given a country where 50 people are brutally murdered if not tortured to death every day. In fact my philosophy [given I could get a license for a gun] if ever I did find someone breaking into my house I empty a canister or two first and ask questions later. Gwebecimele In SA, sometimes rapists are released on bail and they rape again while on bail? What are the consequences for the courts/judges when this happens? Oh yes, just sue the state. Some rapists are given lesser sentences because the were gentle during the rape. Who is weaker here? Accused or victim, family ,potential victims. Will he come out and break the legs of the other guy or deal with the sms sender. Without the denial of bail so far, I doubt if the family or the public would have an idea of what happened that night. Gwebecimele What about this option? http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=358837&sn=Detail&pid=71616 Marizelle Great article! Thanks!! Thokozani Thanks for the clarity Prof Deloris Dolittle Thank you Pierre for a great article! In teh last week or so in Middleburg, a woman was granted R10,000.00 bail after being charged with 6 other people for the murder of her husband (one of the 6 others are her maid, whom she allegedly asked to find people to kill her husband). I don’t think you can get more premeditated than that. The reason was that she has a daughter to take care of. But who will take care of the child if she is convicted? And why the inconsistancy in the media attention to the two matters or is it ok to kill a rich white male but not a rich white female. Many people get charged with murder on a daily basis, why this extreme reponse from both the public and the press one this particular case, I mean the ANCWL was dancing outside the court. I’m not saying there shoudl not be any outrage, there should, but at least be consistant. And I am not overly excited about the fact that Gerrie Nel is the prosecutor, in fact it scares me. I read Mandy’s book on the Bret Kebble murder/assisted suicide. He developed an unhealthy obsession with nailing Jackie S and was willing to let the 4 guys involved in the death of Brett K walk, no conviction no charge nothing (if i remember correctly) just to get to Jackie. I fear that no matter what the facts are, he now wants to nail Oscar (he said as much before the start of court yesterday) and that justice will not prevail because of this. Chris (not the right wing guy!) I must agree, another good piece by Prof De Vos. The comments above shows that the remarks about the inappropriateness of the jury system in the previous post were also spot on. This article was clearly written for the lay person to understand, yet it is clear that some of the previous posters could not comprehend the relatively simple concepts explained. I just shiver at the thought of them forming part of a jury or being a lay assessor who has to decide on the guilt of a person. http://www.ozoneblue.co.za/ Ozoneblue Deloris Dolittle February 20, 2013 at 9:28 am As said commentators including PdV already politicised this crime and escalated that agenda to global level. They just couldn’t wait or help themselves, there is almost a sense of schadenfreude that this time it was a rather wealthy, famous WHITE South African MALE committing such an act. A perfect and politically correct target to sacrifice for the cause. Chris (not the right wing guy!) Deloris Dolittle says: February 20, 2013 at 9:28 am Remember, Gerrie Nel did not handle the prosecution in the Brett Kebble murder case. He was, contraversially so, removed from the case by higher authority and replaced by someone who, judging by news reports, really made a hash of things. And don’t forget that Oscar has Barry Roux on his side. I’ve known Barry Roux professionally for more than 30 years, and if I’m charged with murder today I’ll run straight to him. carl amtana An excellent piece proff…i am a strong believe in equality nd justice for all ….i jst hope tht at the end of the trial justice wud prevail Anonymouse Read from bottom to top: 10:46 – Nair calls half-hour delay so lawyers come up with a better picture of what Pistorius’s bathroom looks like. 10:45 – Nel says objective facts can’t prejudice the State. We’ll adjourn for a few minutes. 10:44 – [Defence attorney] Roux says he wants the plans to be projected. Nair makes it clear that he doesn’t want to prejudice the State’s case. 10:43 – Nair asks if there is a diagram to illustrate this evidence. Roux says he’s given one to Nel. 10:41 Botha: We think [the] shooter would have to walked into [the] bathroom, faced the wall where window was in and fired straight at [the] door. 10:40 – Nel asks Botha if shots were fired directly at toilet basin and he agrees. “If you fire straight at the door, you miss the toilet.” 10:36 – Botha: The top part of the toilet door was broken. Shots were fired through the door. Botha: four shots were fired through the door, four cartridges found. He used a cricket bat to break door. 10:34 – Botha: I saw a firearm on the shower mat. Collected 2 cellphones and 2 more two more Blackberries. The two iPhones were not used that morning. The Blackberries hadn’t been used in months. 10:33 – Botha: Standing in [the] doorway, the shower and toilet are to the right. The toilet is 1.4 by 1.14 metres. 10:32 – Botha: In Oscar Pistorius’s bathroom, I saw part of the toilet door. I saw one cartridge in [the] passage way, three in [the] bathroom. 10:31 – Botha: a passage with cupboards through it lead to the bathroom. You have to turn right to get into [the] bathroom. 10:30 – Botha: If you face the bed, the room entrance is behind you, bathroom entrance to the left. 10:30 – Botha: upstairs and to the right you have the main bedroom. We found an overnight bag and slippers. 10:29 – Botha: You have to pass the deceased and the staircase to the left to get to the kitchen. 10:28 – Botha: As you enter you see the staircase, at the bottom on the left is where [the] deceased was found. 10:27 – Botha: “Pistorius had an unlicensed .38mm pistol in a safe in his bedroom. He had a license for the 9mm pistol used in the shooting.” 10:26 – Pistorius has begun to cry again after details of Reeva’s gunshot wounds are presented. 10:25 – Botha: I was present during [the] post-mortem. Three entrance wounds: right side of head (ear), right elbow (broke arm), hip. 10:25 – Botha says he obtained statements from security guards and neighbours and attended the postmortem of the deceased. 10:24 – Botha: “….if he managed to leave the country, we might struggle to get him back [through extradition].” 10:23 – Nel asks about extradition. Botha: “Difficult. We don’t want another Dewani to happen. We’re still waiting to get him back in the country.” 10:22 – Botha: “[Pistorius]‘s lawyer came to the house with a locksmith to open a safe in the kitchen. It had a USB stick with details of offshore accounts.” 10:22 – Botha: We asked to have the safes open. There was a specific safe in the kitchen but no key, so they brought a locksmith to open it. 10:21 Botha: “We know that he has offshore accounts and a property in Italy. We know this because we went through his safes.” 10:20 – Botha is opposing bail. “The accused could be a flight risk. It’s a serious crime, a serious matter. If he is convicted he faces 15 years to life imprisonment.” 10:19 – Investigating officer Botha: [I] arrived at scene at about 04:15. “I found the deceased lying at the bottom of the stairs.” “She was already declared dead” by medics. “She had on white shorts and black vest. She was covered in towels.” 10:17 – Roux is satisfied with the response, says Barry Bateman. The State calls investigating officer Hilton Botha. 10:16 – Nel reveals that Reeva Steenkamp was shot on right side of her body. He says this is part of case that murder was premeditated. 10:15- Nel: We have a witness who says she heard non-stop fighting between 02:00 and 03:00 [on the] morning of [the] shooting. 10:14 – Nel: The state is in possession of a statement that there was an argument. 10:13 – Nel: State not obliged to provide information to accused, but will go into detail with some questions. Bearing in mind the investigation is not concluded. Nel says the first order of business is a response to the application by defence for further information. 10:12 – Magistrate apologises that efforts to set up a video link to the overflow courtroom have been unsuccessful. 10:11 – Oscar Pistorius enters the courtroom … And the magistrate greets him “Goodmorning sir”, [Pistorius] replies “Good morning Your Worship”. 10:10 – Barry Bateman: “Nair enters court. The accused is called. Oscar is wearing the same black suit.” 10:09 – Pistorius bail hearing resumes. 10:06 – Barry Bateman tweets: “Counsel returns. Nair is being called. We’ll start soon.” 10:03 – Mandy Wiener tweets: Court official tells us he can’t hold up the case any longer. It will go ahead and they’ll try set up the feed as soon as possible. 09:47 – Barry Bateman says State and defence counsel are absent. They’re probably in chambers. 09:46 – @JacaNews tweets: Investigator Hilton Botha in [a] black suit, grey shirt and tie. 09:45 – Delays in setting up extra media room,where TV screens meant to show proceedings in Court C, mean Oscar Pistorius case still hasn’t started, says Karyn Maughan. 09:35 – No demonstration and no banners outside courthouse today. Just a dozen bored camera crews, tweets Phillip de Wet. 09:35 – Mandy Wiener: “And the TV screens arrive! Hoorah.” 09:29 – Andrew Harding says Pistorius’s father is now seated and appears to be praying. 09:26 – “I just spotted members of the defence team rolling up what looked like house plans. Likely used to plot movement,” tweets Barry Bateman. 09:25 – Barry Bateman tweets that Oscar Pistorius’s family have taken up the same spot behind the dock – father Henke, brother Carl and sister Aimee. 09:16 – Court official tells photographers to leave court – before they can get pictures of Pistorius, says Karyn Maughan. 09:12 – Official says he will delay proceedings in the main courtroom until TV screen arrives as it is downstairs allegedly, says Mandy Wiener. 09:11 – Karyn Maughan tweets: “Pistorius’s family try not to look at the dozens of photographers taking pictures of them. Some bow their heads.” 09:11 – Photographers have been allowed in, tweets @barrybateman. They’ll be asked to leave when court proceedings start. 09:07 – State expected to kick off proceedings by responding to his lawyer’s request for answers to “our 5 key questions”, says Karyn Maughan. A member of Pistorius’s defence team has told Andrew Harding Tuesday “went well”. Today could be tougher. 09:05 – Oscar Pistorius’s brother Carl now back in court and deep in conversation with the defence’s forensic team, says Karyn Maughan. 09:05 – Pistorius has been sitting with his brother in the holding cells, says Karyn Maughan. [His] brother bought him energy drinks and protein bars. 09:02 – Phillip de Wet tweets: “Media overflow room is (shock!) not ready. No video screens, audio link isn’t up yet. Well played again, DoJ.” 08:59 – Investigating officer for prosecution tells Andrew Harding he’ll go through evidence for much of day. 08:57 – Media access: everyone stands in fairly orderly line for accreditation. Then everyone forms a mob and pushes and shouts, says Phillip de Wet. 08:56 – Karyn Maughan tweets: Am okay thanks everyone. Got caught in the Pistorius media crush and fainted. But fine now and back in court. 08:52 – Phillip de Wet tweets: Award for best attempt at Pistorius access must go to Telegraph’s @Simmoa. “It’s my birthday!” she shouts at officials. Really is too. 08:50 – Mandy Wiener tweets: “Every citizen who is not a journalist now wants access to overflow court.

Sweltering day here in Pretoria.” lunga Under these articulation, Pistorius stand giid chsnce to be granted bail. Anonymouse “In such cases the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) can issue a written confirmation that he or she intends charging the accused with one of these schedule 6 offences, which the court considering bail will take as prima facie proof of the charge to be brought against the accused by the Prosecuting Authority. … The bail hearing of Oscar Pistorius is based on this section, but because the NDPP did not issued a note confirming the schedule 6 charge, the court must first decide whether there is a significant likelihood that Pistorius will indeed be charged with “premeditated murder”. ” I don’t agree —- Here is my 5 cents’ woth: S 60(11) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977: “(11) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, where an accused is charged with an offence referred to- (a) in Schedule 6, the court shall order that the accused be detained in custody until he or she is dealt with in accordance with the law, unless the accused, having been given a reasonable opportunity to do so, adduces evidence which satisfies the court that exceptional circumstances exist which in the interests of justice permit his of her release; (b) in Schedule 5, but not in Schedule 6, the court shall order that the accused be detained in custody until he or she is dealt with in accordance with the law, unless the accused, having been given a reasonable opportunity to do so, adduces evidence which satisfies the court that the interests of justice permit his or her release.” Sect 60(11A): “(11A)(a) If the attorney-general {DPP} intends charging any person with an offence referred to in Schedule 5 or 6 the attorney-general may, irrespective of what charge is nooted on the charge sheet, at any time before such person pleads to the charge, issue a written confirmation to the effect that he or she intends to charge the accused with an offence referred to in Schedule 5 or 6. …” I don’t see the reason for the long arguments by the parties and the ruling by Desmond Nair yesterday that Oscar is probably to be charged with a Schedule 6 offence – if the prosecutor (in this case, a Senior State Advocate of the DPP’s office) states that he is charging the accused with premeditated murder, regardless of whether a section 60(11A) certificate has been issued by the DPP or not, then cadit quaestio – the court cannot second-guess his decision to charge him with the said offence. (I believe that a formally completed charge sheet was read out to court, clearly stating that Oscar is ‘charged’ with a Schedule 6 offence.) He is ‘charged’ with a Scedule 6 offence, and he bears the onus impposed by sectionn 60(11)(a) and thats it. The section does not require that he be ‘convicted’ or, that there is a probability of his being convicted of a shedule 6 offence. Section 60(11A) is only intended to help the court determine the issue where the prosecutor at the stage of the bail hearing is indecisive as to whether the accused has to be charged with a Schedule 5 or a Shedule 6 offence – and then sect 60(11)(A) – read with sect 50(6)(d)(ii) of the CPA – helps the prosecutor to obtain his senior’s opinion in the form of a certificate as to with what kind of crime the accused should be charged – and in such a case, the certificate will be prima facie proof of the state’s intention (which can of course still change before the hearing on the merits. S 60(11A) (read with sect 50(6)(d)(ii) of the CPA is therefore designed to help inexperienced prosecutors (or the court, in the case of indifferent prosecutors as per sect 60(10) of the CPA) to determine the regime (the onus of proof issue) of the bail application at hand. I think Barry Roux wasted a precious lot of time (and of Oscar’s money) in feebly arguing that there is a possibility or even a probability that Oscar will in thye end not be charged with a Schedule 6 offence, and therefore, that his onus is lighter. If he thinkks that there is a possibility (or even a probability) that Oscar might not be convicted of a Schedule 6 offence should he be so charged, he is free to present evidence to that effect, and to argue that the lack of apparent strenght in the state’s case in itself provides for an exceptional circumstance which in the interest of justice permits Oscar’s release on bail. But to second-guess the prosecutor’s decision for purposes of determining the onus issue (or, requiring the court to do so) is impermissible in terms of the bail legislation. At most, he can argue that his case as opposed to that of the state, provides for exceptional circumstances. Otherwise – a good piece Prof. Gwebecimele @ Mouse I am with you on this one. “I think Barry Roux wasted a precious lot of time (and of Oscar’s money) in feebly arguing that there is a possibility or even a probability that Oscar will in thye end not be charged with a Schedule 6 offence, and therefore, that his onus is lighter” Let him play delaying tactics behind bars. Priority here is justice for the family and not bail for the accused. Dan Thanks for this Prof, It’s up to your usual high standards. Can I ask about appeal though? Presumably OP has can appeal any bail decision – initially to the High Court and then upwards to the Constitutional court? Dan Anonymouse Dan February 20, 2013 at 12:14 pm Both the state and an accused has a right to appeal a bail decision – depending on who lost. The route is then – High Court (even a single judge can hear a bail appeal – as an exception to the rule); Supreme Court of Appeals; and, currently, if a constitutional issue arises, a bail appeal can be brought in the Constitutional Court Maggs Naidu – Yikes, another seven years! (maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) Anonymouse February 20, 2013 at 12:50 pm Doc Mouse, It seem that the IO is being torn to shreds. Is it normal to expect the IO to have all the information while the investigation is still underway? It does seem like Nel missed some obvious stuff though – like were there any other phones. Zoo Keeper I see an activists group is protesting outside court demanding OP be denied bail until he has proved his innocence.

(maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) February 20, 2013 at 13:18 pm Yesterday I already said that, even people who are eventually convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment can get bail – it all (or mostly)depends on how strong the case is or whether the lack of strength in the state’s case can be regarded as exceptional circumstance justifying release on bail. The concessions that the IO has made do not really strenghten Pistorius’ version – to the contrary, where he made no concessions, the strenght of the state’s case is underscored – e.g., about the female shouts when the first shot went off, the lights that were on, that Reeva didn’t answer when Pistorius called out to the suspected intruders or her to call the cops, the angle at which the shots have been fired (even a layperson can see that one had to shoot rather straight towards the toilet – in other words, he must have known thet the intruder or intruders were actually on the toilet, the fact that he planned to shoot the suspected intruders without establishing whether he is entitled in law to do so (viz the requirements for the defence of private defence or putative private defence to be raised successfully in a murder trial) – which still amounts to premeditated murder (it is not a requirement that he should know exactly who the victim is), etc, etc. I still think that there are indications that the case against Pistorius is strong, and that a probability exists that he will be successfully prosecuted. Therefore, the concessions by the IO, in my opinion, do not detract from the strenght of the state’s case, and that cannot be regarded as exceptional circumstance. There might be other factors though, like his physical disability, that may be regarded as exceptional in his favour – it will depend on how Desmond nair sees it. However, the magistrate’s questions about Pistorius’ flight-risk status seems to suggest that, even if there is a strong case to be made out against Pistorius, he might be inclined to grant bail. Remember that bail conditions can be imposed that will make it virtually impossible for Pistorius to flee (leave the country – except if he pulls a Dirk Pretorius in the Adv Barbie matter, and convinces a court to rescind the bail condition that he may not leave the country and flees to Belarus), or to meddle with evidence or exhibits or to present a threat to society. A bail hearing is a funny thing – in one court it might succeed, in another not, and the attempt by Parliament to impose specific guidelines in legislation for the courts to follow has not yet proven successful to bring about unanimity. Maggs Naidu – Yikes, another seven years! (maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) Anonymouse February 20, 2013 at 15:45 pm Doc, It may well be that he intended to shoot an intruder. But the state’s case is that he intended to shoot Reeva. So far it seem that the IO has not been able to provide evidence to dispute his version. While there may be much while will hold back his getting bail – it seems the IO was too macho with his presumptions e.g. not checking if there were other phones; not confirming the “testosterone”; not checking if calls were made to police;security; ambulance. If the tweets are anything to go by, it’s surprising that Nel did not prepare the IO well enough. Mikhail Dworkin Fassbinder Maggs, I know this is a bit off topic, but it is relevant insofar as you continue to use the offensive YIKES ANOTHER 7 YEARS exclamation.

But the state’s case is that he intended to shoot Reeva. No – it’s not. In any event, the ID of the deceased is irrelevant in a murder charge – a guy who plants a bomb (McGoos Bar for example – McBride!) does not know who his victims will be. Unless Oscar knew Reeva was behind the door (and I’m willing to bet he did), it doesn’t matter in a murder trial (and bail hearing) who he thought the victim might be – if he thought of killing someone, he is guilty, no matter that he killed someone else. Maggs Naidu -Shit happens!

(maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) Anonymouse February 20, 2013 at 17:22 pm Do Mouse, Is it correct that the record of the bail hearing cannot be used in the trial? Deloris Dolittle Chris, yes I know it Nel was not the eventual prosecutor in the Kebble trial but he was the prosecutor in the Selebi matter and until I read the mentioned book I did not know there was such a hugh connection between the two matters. Really enjoying the comments on this one, criminal law was never my forte and I’m learning a lot, thanks to all and sundrie. Must just say, all the half truths told by the IO convinces me more that Nel really does not care about the truth, just about the conviction. Chris Deloris Dolittle February 20, 2013 at 18:50 pm Deloris, you must remeber two things: First: Barry Roux is a master of cross examination. I’ve seen him in action on a number of occations, and he knows every trick in the book – especially how to make a witeness look bad and feel bad. To the reporters present (lay persons) certain concessions or answers may look huge, while it will make little impression on a trained lawyer. In his reply to the initial arguments by Gerrie Nel, Barry Roux reportedly responded with “so what” a number of times. The same goes for for many of the concessions made by Botha. Secondly, when evaluating evidence the preciding officer does it on the totality of all the evidence. The tacitcs by the defence today were something like A is possible, B is possible, C is possible and D is possible. That does not bring you anywhere unless you can say A and B and C and D are all possible at the same time. Most law students know the case of the wife who drowned in the bathtub. The accused’s first wife drowned in the bath after an epileptic fit, shortly after having changed her will in favour of the accused. That is possible. The accused’s second wife drowned in the bath after an epileptic fit, shortly after having changed her will in favour of the accused. That is possible. The accused’s third wife drowned in the bath after an epileptic fit, shortly after having changed her will in favour of the accused.That is possible. But is it reasonably possibly true that all three his wifes died in such similar circumstances? No, it isn’t. Back to the Brett Kebble murder, the witnesses who got amensty was to secure the conviction of Agliotti, and not Selebi. Furthermore, I believe if Gerrie Nel was not removed from the case apparently for political reasons, Agliotti would have been convicted. The acquittal followed a ruling that Agliotti’s affidavit used during the bail application may not be used in evidence. As far as I could gather the poor prosecutor did not even know that there is a well motivated judgement where a KZN judge came to the opposite conclution, and therefore did not use it in argument before this (in my opinion wrong) ruling was made. The State then just threw in the towel, where it had the opportunity to get finality from the SCA. Maggs, the record of the bail hearing can be used at the trail. However the evidence by the accused may only be used if certain prerequisites are met, and evidence of his previous convictions and pending cases led during the bail application are excluded.

Pingback: Oscar Pistorius: Day 2 Wrap-Up and Bail Prediction - I Hate Paypal Gwebecimele It seems as if this case is poorly prepared. Maggs Naidu -Shit happens! (maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) Gwebs – after reading Doc Mouse and Chris I get the sense that, while the training and readiness of our cops leaves a lot to be desired, it’s not as I initially thought. In addition the oke has a house in Italy which does not have extradition treaty with us and offshore accounts which he did not reveal. In response, Botha said the police were confident of their investigation and were awaiting final reports on ballistics, forensics and pathology matters, which would, along with crime-scene analysis documents, shore up their case. Nel, redirecting Botha, suggested that Pistorius’s affidavit provided more questions than answers. He said to the detective: “You have not been provided with all the evidence have you? There was a fifth cellphone . but you do not have it do you? Is this not strange? Surely if his lawyers were as helpful as they claim you would have everything you require?” Botha replied that he was battling to obtain evidence, including the “mysterious fifth cellphone”. “We found a holster, a safe with 38 .38 special unlicensed rounds of ammunition, four cellphones . [on] none of which calls [had been] made to police, complex security guards or paramedics . drugs believed to be steroids, syringes, needles and a cricket bat with blood splatters . “We were suspicious . on top of this there was a memory stick containing details of an overseas bank account on it, which his brother and lawyer took . We are concerned Pistorius is a flight risk . he has assets he has not declared . an offshore bank account and a house in Italy,” he said. Botha told the court that, in 2009, he had questioned Pistorius at his home on a charge of assault, which was later dropped. http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2013/02/21/oscar-cop-hammered Mikhail Dworkin Fassbinder Maggs, this “Oscar fuss” has distracted many of our people from the launch of Ramphele’s AGANG “platform.” But is that such a bad thing?

If Rampele is hoping to become a formidable force based on changing the constituency system it sounds a no-hoper to me.

Mikhail Dworkin Fassbinder @ Maggs ” The NDP and the ANC’s policy documents have more interesting stuff.” Maggs is right.

Zoo Keeper Mouse Interesting point you raised – he did not establish he had the right in law to shoot?

(maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) says: February 21, 2013 at 8:12 am Chris One thing nobody seems to have mentioned up tp now- what if Oscar’s version of events is accepted. It is common cause that he killed Reeva. The next question must be, was it unlawful. There the test will be as follows: Was his conduct contrary to the community’s perception of justice or equity or the legal convictions of the community. Just imagine how many women will die every night if Oscar’s coduct was seen as acceptable! I think the answer will be a resounding no. Next you have to look at fault. Fault can be intention or negligence. Consciousness of wrongfulness is an element of intention. I understand Gerrie Nel’s argumaent to be that even if Oscar’s version is accepted, he is guilty of murder because his intention was to murder an intruder. If he said that, I think he is wrong because the State will then have to prove that Oscar realised that he was acting unlawfully when firing the shots. That leaves us with negligence. I think negligence in this context is a failure to exercise the care which a reasonable person would exercise in those circumstances. I have no doubt that on his own version Oscar was grossly negligent and would, should his version be accepted, be convicted of culpable homicide. Then there is the .38 firearm and ammunition he had in his safe. To have kept it for his father would not be a defence in law. If he is charged with that, he will probably admit guilt. Zoo Keeper Mouse Does the law require the intruder to attack first? Is it the case of fire when fired upon? What happened to the right to safety and security of person – a positive right by the way? Surely, if a threat is detected (and lets discount the OP case here and deal with principle) and you act against a real and subjective perception of that threat, you have done nothing wrong? Captain Hindsight is surely misplaced in these incidents? SA has one of the highest crime rates in the world – almost all of us fear an unknown bump in the night. Panic can set in; very quickly and very easily. Surely the benchmark is the average Joe Soap in a panic, not a well-trained SWAT team member? Back to OP, everyone seems to be judging his actions from the point of view of their Hollywood education and X-Box experience. What happens when someone freaks out and panics?

Zoo Keeper Maggs and everyone Let’s take Steenkamp out of the bathroom and put her in the bed. Let’s put genuine intruder(s) in the bathroom. I have no idea of the layout of the house so we’ll assume they broke in through the bathroom window. Now what? Does OP go and open the door and get himself killed when the intruder shoots him first? What if we were reading headlines like “Intruders shoot OP dead, girlfriend brutally gang-raped and tortured to death”? Think rationally for once. How does the story change if there was a genuine threat waiting in the bathroom? Mouse – does the law require OP to first expose himself to danger and run the risk of getting killed? Or does the law respect the fact the a citizen may launch a pre-emptive strike when confronted with a threat in his own home? Maggs Naidu -Shit happens! (maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) Zoo Keeper February 21, 2013 at 9:46 am ZooKy, “Does OP go and open the door and get himself killed when the intruder shoots him first?” No – the first thing a man with a gun should do is to lock himself (and his girlfriend) in his bedroom and alert the security, the police, neighbours, friends and anyone else he can. It’s reported that the particular complex has excellent security. Chris Maggs Naidu -Shit happens! (maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) says: February 21, 2013 at 9:35 am Hi Maggs, No, it is without doubt unlawful, but the State will have to prove that Oscar subjectively realised that at the moment when he fired the shots before there can be a conviction of murder. That is a question of fact, an no matter how illogical it sounds to us, the judge will have to decide what went on in Oscars mind at that moment. http://www.ozoneblue.co.za/ Ozoneblue Maggs Naidu -Shit happens!

If you see the layout there is no door separating the bathroom from the bedroom, only the toilet from the bathroom and this was locked from the inside i.e. if you accept OP version of events the intruder[s] would be able to unlock the door and initiate an attack. This doesn’t answer a simple question like why would the intruder[s] lock themselves in the toilet though. Perhaps OP thought they needed to take a quick crap? Chris Back to the topic, I think Oscar will get bail. http://www.ozoneblue.co.za/ Ozoneblue Chris February 21, 2013 at 9:56 am It takes my security almost 1/2 hour to arrive sometimes.

(maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) February 20, 2013 at 18:38 pm Maggs – wrong – the record of bail proceedings will form part of the trial record and may be used (with the exclusion only of proof of previous convictions, if proven – which must be excised from the record). So, Oscar will have to stand and fall by whatever he said in his affidavit and, should Botha testify in the main trial, he will also be in quite a spot if he deviates from his testimony at the bail hearing, unless he can otherwise expalin the discrepancy to the satisfaction of the court. I don’t think he’ll necessarily testify though, since most of what he said was hearsay (other witnesses will have to testify) and opinion evidence (experts will have to testify to bolster his opinions before they will be accepted). He will, if required to testify, only be required to say what he found on the scene, and then other witnesses’ evidence will have to fill in the facts. Mags (again) and Zoo Keeper: Oscar just trying to ‘neutralise’ an intruder, not intending to kill him/her? Nonsense – how can you ‘neutralise’ someone if you do not even know who he/she is, where ecxactly he/she is, whether he/she needs to be ‘neutralised’ (i.e., is he/she armed – does he/she pose a threat?) ?! Remember, the common law of private defence requires that there must have been an unlawful attack on someone’s property or life and limb before one can rely on the defence – the test is objective ex post facto. In this case, ex post facto established, there was no intrusion or unlawful attack. Secondly, the means used to defend one’s property or onneself must be the only reasonable means with which to stop the attack. Even if he only ‘thought’ that there was an intruder – putative private defence – he will have to show that he had reasonable grounds to believe that he was under iminent attack and that he was within his rights to shoot at an unidentified person behind a locked door, without establishing whether that person posed a threat at all. Unforunately I do not have the time to further elaborate – off to court myself – but Oscar does not have a channce in hell to escape conviction on a murder charge (perhaps not pre-meditated – a question that can be debated still – but still murder) http://www.ozoneblue.co.za/ Ozoneblue Anonymouse February 21, 2013 at 10:22 am “Even if he only ‘thought’ that there was an intruder – putative private defence – he will have to show that he had reasonable grounds to believe that he was under iminent attack and that he was within his rights to shoot at an unidentified person behind a locked door, without establishing whether that person posed a threat at all.” This “law” is a sick joke hey?

We are being terrorised inside our own homes. And is it not interesting how the culture of violent crime in South Africa his hardly mentioned in the circumstances by the media and political fallout now all focused on the case of this murderous “irrational” OP.

Zoo Keeper Maggs I’m happy for you no-one got hurt, I really am. But others are not so lucky. The 75-year in Krugersdorp didn’t own a gun but last week he got beaten to death by robbers anyway.

Whilst the public may be interested, it doesn’t mean its in the public interest his applications are disclosed. I just surprised the DFO didn’t send the location of OP’s gun safe and the combination too. Anonymouse Zoo Keeper February 21, 2013 at 11:07 am (and OzoneBlue) The sanctity of human life is such that the law cannot play ‘what if’ games. What if the genuine intruder was a helpless child running from rapists and robbers; or, what if the genuine intruder was a hungry five-year-old child looking for something to eat in the rich white man’s house; or, more to the point, what if the perceived intruder is actually one’s bedpartner who went for a wee – Oscar didn’t even consider that possibility? You see – there are simply too many what if’s to be reckoned with. That is why the CC declared s 49 of the CPA unconstitutional some time ago – and, in its present form, even the police may only shoot and kill in real private defence situationns – and they may not shoot and kill in situations where even a 10 year old would have known that it is unlawful to shoot first and then ask questions. (By the way, Oscar is a licensed gun owner – that is pretty basic stuff he should have known to pass the competency test to get a fire arm.) You know – the way you are going on reminds me of an urban legend that was told while I was still in primary school. You can shoot and kill anyone right outside your house and, as long as you drag him into your house afterwards to show that he was an intruder, you will not be held accountable – as it will be regarded as ‘justified manslaughter’ if you shot and killed an intruder. Later, when I studied law, however, I discovered that that story was utter bullshit. (How about the farmer shooting and killing people he thought were baboons that were going to steal some mealies?) Zoo Keeper Mouse OK, so let me see if I have this correct then: OP had to first establish the identity of the occupant of the toilet before shooting? He had to first make a positive ID that there was a genuine intruder. Once he had a positive ID he has to wait until his life is threatened before acting in self-defense. Do I have it right? Maggs Naidu – Iyoh!

Gwebecimele @ Zook Not just identify but also be sure that the intruder is armed and ready to attack. Zoo Keeper Gwebes Thanks Mouse will shortly correct me; but OP had to first place himself and his safety at risk before being entitled to defend himself? Mouse brought up the old urban legend of shooting someone in the backyard and dragging them inside to claim self-defense. That is misdirection of my point. My point was, in order for the right to defend oneself to exist, one has to be under an actual attack. One cannot see an attack coming and go on the offensive to defend oneself – it is a case of only fire when fired upon. If they hit you first then tough luck I suppose. Anon Lawyer Girl Thank you for this informative piece. I feel like distributing it to the general public and requiring a full understanding of the article before I even debate this matter with anyone. Gwebecimele @ Zook You don’t have to wait for your attacker to attack first. If he is armed & approaching within a threatening distance you can attack or if he is attacking another member of the family (including your dog) you can shoot. In a case where you are behind a locked burglar door you have an option to move back into the house.

Again from EUSEBIUS McKAISER: “Cry, the Misogynistic Country” “But the Pistorius case tells us that brutal violence against women is an equal-opportunity affliction in South Africa; it has no respect for whether its victims are rich or poor, black or white, suburban or rural. Our society is drenched in violence. A woman is safe in neither a shack nor a mansion.” As said for dear EUSEBIUS one swallow definitely makes a summer. What are the stats then, what percentage violent women abuse happens in impoverished squatter camps and rural areas, and what percentage occur in the more financially secure and socially stable middle class environment. I guess it would be something like 1000:1. Why is it then so important for black middle class EUSEBIUS to latch onto this event, like some fucking ideological parasite, refer to this as an “equal-opportunity affliction”. To run to the NY times with such denialist bullshit? http://www.ozoneblue.co.za/ Ozoneblue Sorry forgot the link. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/opinion/cry-the-misogynistic-country.html?_r=0 Henri Forget the bail. He ought to get bail. Period. But here is the bottomline: http://www.beeld.com/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Bly-moord-al-het-Oscar-gedink-hy-skiet-inbreker-20130219 On his own version he is guilty of murder. The test is as in R v Attwood 1946 AD 331 at 340 [recently affirmed by the SCA in Mugwena 2006[4] SA 150 SCA at 158C]: “[homicide in self-defence is justified if the person concerned]…’had been unlawfully attacked and had reasonable grounds for thinking that he was in danger of death or serious injury, that the means he used were not excessive in relation to the danger, and that the means he used were the only or least dangerous whereby he could avoid the danger’ “. Oscar’s version fails this test. His intruder were hiding in the toilet behind a closed door when he pumped at least three shots through that door. He was thus not being attacked at that very stage. Point is, even if the State’s case falls apart, he is still guilty on his own version. Forget all the other brouhaha and shenanigans. Zoo Keeper Just a thought on the women stuff. Women make up approximately 20% of all homicides and men the other 80%. Guess some others don’t really count when there’s a political point to score. Michael Osborne @ Zooks “Women make up approximately 20% of all homicides and men the other 80″ Yes, and blacks are overwhelmingly the victims of violent crime. That does not stop some from politicizing crime, and claiming a select GENOCIDE of whites. Gwebecimele How will our courts view the latest development around construction of etolls?

If that is the case against him then given the same circumstance I would probably have done exactly the same. Take as many of those bastards out as possible BEFORE they come through that door. If they want to lock me up and call me a murderer for defending my wife and family against such savagery, then let it be so. http://www.ozoneblue.co.za/ Ozoneblue Michael Osborne February 21, 2013 at 13:48 pm Yes. It is exactly the same tactic – just we don’t have senior leaders and politicians running around singing “rape the female”, nor advocating for a Armageddon to be perpetuated against women nor blaming them for each and everything that is wrong in the country. Mikhail Dworkin Fassbinder What I have learned is that is is vital to RACIALISE and POLITICIZE absolutely everything.

In the meantime, I just saw a stat that lends more support to your cause than fantasies about the needs to have big guns (and nukes?), at home to fight a notional future tyranny. In the US one hears a lot about the terrible risk of having a gun at home, because kids accidentally shoot themselves or each other. Yet, according to Daniel Levitt, the figures show that mortality risk posed by swimming pools are about 100X greater than the risk posed by guns.

That it’s the engagement that matters – the attempt to connect, emotionally and practically. That’s the point, I think, Jay Naidoo was trying to make. But to start that engagement, and then to follow it through authentically… well, everyone involved has to take enormous risks. We have to risk our own hearts.” I posted a suggestion some time ago that young middle/upper class South Africans should be drafted into a national service project and spend at least one year of their lives working together on social projects in the townships and rural areas. I can recall you shot that idea down like a lead balloon, preferring a socalled “white tax” instead. Anonymouse Zoo Keeper – if your paranoid lookout on things spreads throughout this country, we will end up with people (hopefully legal gun owners) shooting left right and centre, just because we do not know whether the guy approaching me is a big bad wolf in disguise. Isn’t that just a recipe for anarchy? Oscar saw the bathroom window was open, but no one in the bathroom, so, whomever was there must have locked him / her or themselves (you visualized three robbers at one time if I remember correctly) in a small toilet, because he / she / they are obviously afraid of being discovered by a guy with no legs shouting at them (what he shouted, if he did – he never said). Now, just to make sure they aren’t a bunch of uglies – he starts shooting off, not once, but four times, to make sure that, if he had hit someone, that someone stays hit before he takes further action.

Thanks. Ze Philosopher Chris-Note in criminal law the word “Intention” is slightly a technical term that has different meaning to what a lay person would understand it to mean, hence Gerrie Nel is sticking to his guns it was pre-planned by Oscar. Further, point of correction my learned friend, he does deserve to be charged with Murder as his actions give rise to Dolus Eventualis. Even though his main aim was to avoid being robbed or preventing harm, he realised that in order to achieve his main aim, there was possibility that he may kill, and was reckless as to whether or not this does in fact happen, then he should be regarded as having had legal intention coz Reeva died. I think he subjectively foresaw the possibility that in achieving his main aim, the unlawful act may result and he was reckless as to whether or not the unlawful act may be committed. In S v Rebede- Musi said Dolus Eventualis or Legal Intention is present when perpetrator objectively foresees the possibility of his act causing death and persists regardless of the outcome, suffices to find someone guilty of murder. Further we have to note that necessity is not justifiable in our law if an innocent life was lost. Therefore I am of the view OP acted with intent when he took his gun and shot at the alleged burglar 4 times. Bear in mind that Intention in our law has gradually been extended to cover not just deliberate, but also foreseen conduct. Given his version that he thought there were intruders in his house, he may just as well fall with his own sword because his statement rings of intention to shoot the intruder. Like Gerrie Nel says “There were two people in that house on that fateful night, one is dead and the other is the accused. We shoudn’t really be delving into “What If” bcoz it is the cold facts that matter now. The only issue we are ought to question ourselves on is his “Direct State of Mind” at that hour, minute and second. Big ups to Prof De Vos again on a wonderful piece. http://www.ozoneblue.co.za ozoneblue Or avoid being killed i.e. self-defence, since if his story is true had it been armed robbers he and his girl friend may both have been very brutally raped, tortured and murdered much like that Walkerville family. Just remind us again what sentence did those savages get? That is right – nobody gives a fuck, their brutal deaths didn’t even make it this blog. http://www.ozoneblue.co.za ozoneblue @mfd It is big joke aint it. Belief in God aside, what my dear pappa also said – what goes around comes around some fine day when you least expect it. Chris Ze Philosopher February 21, 2013 at 21:50 pm Remember, my post is not about what the judgement should be – that would be premature – but what it would be if Oscar’s version is accepted. Consciousness of wrongfulness is an element of intention in all its forms. Oscar’s own version is that he did not have any consciousness of wrongfulness. A court may find differently, but then Oscar’s version is also rejected. Dmwangi @Maggs: I hear India is needing extra national service men and women (given some of the threats expected during the ongoing rape season) – you really should apply for both positions. You could use your talents effectively – if you talk kak to your rapist mates like you do here, they will run away forever. #JustSaying! Paul Kearney @M Ozzie Osbourne; “Yes, and blacks are overwhelmingly the victims of violent crime. That does not stop some from politicizing crime, and claiming a select GENOCIDE of whites.” Yes and black people make up “overwhelmingly” the majority of the population in SA. Are you are genius? Tell us about the US maybe or some context. Michael Osborne @ Paul Kearney You need be no genius to understand that I meant that black South Africans are disproportionately more victimized by crime than others — meaning that the per-capita mortality rate of deaths is higher for blacks than for other groups. One example: the Medical Research Council, in its investigation into female homicide rates in South Africa , used national mortuary data to determine that 2,8 of every 100 000 white women die as a result of murder, whereas 8,9 Africans do. (S Mathews et al, A National Study of Female Homicide in South Africa, MRC Policy Brief 5, 2004.) You ask specifically about the US. Same pattern emerges. Blacks make up 13% of the population, yet account for 50% of murder victims. (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080901964.html) http://www.ozoneblue.co.za ozoneblue So we have a CIO who is up for murder himself.

Maggs Naidu – Iyoh! (maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) Dmwangi February 22, 2013 at 9:31 am Aww Dm, That’s not kind. I’m such a nice guy. spoiler There are so many more reasonable steps that OP could have taken had he genuinely believed he was in imminent danger as pointed out already. Here’s a comparable scenario. Unlike OP I have actually had 2 burglars/robbers attempt to enter my home via a stoep door in my young sons room. I awoke, went to see what the noise was and caught them in the act, still trying to open the door which remained locked because of extra barrel bolts I had installed. They had already broken the key lock and had rucksacks and tools with them, no doubt some of them sharp. I shouted very loudly at the burglars and they took flight. I shudder to think what would have happened had they got in. I could have fetched a weapon and shot at them and would have done so had they been about to enter the house, but before I did that I could have retreated and locked my sons door – he wasnt in the room at the time, triggered the alarm, locked myself in my own room with my son, and then they were on the other side of a still locked door retrieved my firearm, to be used as a last resort if they attempted to gain entry to my room. The difference between my situation and OP’s was I could see they were indeed criminals on my property and trying to enter with evil intent. The last thing I want is a dead body in my house unless I have no other option. Oscar also had options but simply blasted shots through a locked door….. Chris News24 reports: “11:38 – Nair has two bodyguards standing either side of him in court, says Alex Crawford.” Made me think of an incident I read about once, where the attorney asked the magistrate: Are you a magistrate of a clown? Anonymouse Zoo Keeper February 21, 2013 at 17:37 pm “Mouse Please don’t reach for the glib remarks just yet. What I said was, what if there were genuine intruders there? Must OP wait until they burst out of the bathroom until he shoots, or can he take pre-emptive action. …” Definitely not – especially if the reasonable (even paranoid) person in his position would have first considered why an ‘intruder’ having accessed the bathroom through an open window would have gone into a 1.4×1.4 toilet and closed the door. He could then have positioned himself nicely / defensively behind the corner of tthe bathroom (see the plans) and, if an ‘intruder’ then responded to his challenge, with a gun (or even a knife) in his hand – he could easily have fired one or two shots (so as not to over kill) – he is a good shot, remember. See also Gerrie Nel’s address earlier this morning – remarking it strange that a paranoid man like Pistorius would leave open the door, the balcony and the bathroom window, well knowing that the previous day ladders and scaffoldings (not proven) were left there by contractors. The facts, as far as I am concerned, do not support the ‘what if’ question you posed. Neither do the probabilities favour it. There are serious aspects in Pistorius’ version which was left untested because he elected not to testify viva voce, but by presenting an affidavit to court, which cannot be cross-examined. But – in any event – there is simply no room for the ‘what if’ debate here – it wasn’t an intruder, it was Reeva Steenkamp – that’s it. But even if the ‘what if’ debate had any relevance, before he coulld be allowed to take pre-emptive action, he must be certain that it is necessary, otherwise his action is unlawful. …………………… Brett Nortje February 21, 2013 at 21:32 pm I indeed think that makwanyane should be re-visited. But the CC judges will not do so, even on application by the NPA, Solidarity, Afri-Forum or whomever. They will only really consider it if Parliament considers amending section 11 of the Constitution of the RSA to something like: “Everyone has the right to life, provided that the state has the right to carry out a death sentence on a convicted person which has been imposed by a competent court of law after a fair hearing, and after all remedies of appeal and petitions for clemency have been exhausted.” And then the Criminal Procedure Act will have to be changed so as to prescribe in which circumstances the death penalty could be considered or must be imposed. There should also ideally be safety catches such as that a court imposing a death sentence must be constituted of at least one presiding judge and two legally trained assessors; that an automatic right of appeal exists to the Full Bench (at least 3xjudges) and to the SCA (at least 5xjudges); and that there is also an appeal to the Constitutional Court Full Bench (11 judges). But – such amendment would require a two-third majority in Parliament, which I don’t think will be mustered; and, I am not convinced that, currently, we really have enough (competent – mind you!) judges who will impose the death penalty when called upon to do so in terms of a specific law. I think the answer to your question will remain a ‘far-fetched dream’ for some time to come yet.

If you take Oscar’s version of events at face value, none of that seems applicable – if you give him the benefit of the doubt, he didn’t know how many intruders there were, what kind of weapons they carried and exactly how soon they would burst through that door.

Ozoneblue says: February 22, 2013 at 12:24 pm Zoo Keeper Thanks Mouse, very informative as always. I had posited a hypothetical situation for answer which seems to have been forgotten. The “what if” is important because it informs principle. Hypothetically I put Reeva safely in bed and OP faced with noises coming from his toilet. He checks she’s there and makes sure she’s not in his line of fire. His other doors and windows are secure. He has acted reasonably at all times up to this moment. I say this to remove the anomalies of the real case so we aren’t dragged back there. In this hypothetical situation, there are three of SA’s most brutal rapists and murderers who have just climbed into the toilet and are gathering themselves for their Blitzkrieg. They have broken in through the toilet window and intend to torture, rape and kill. They are armed with firearms and knives. Now, must OP wait until they open the door and come out guns blazing, or can he take pre-emptive action and fire at the door? The hypothetical situation ends in one of three ways: 1. OP shouts out “who’s in there?”, they shoot through the door and kill him. They then proceed to do the worst to Reeva who does not survive either. 2. OP fires into the door killing all three and saves the day. 3. OP waits, they burst out shooting and he shoots back. I’ll give OP the benefit and he kills one, wounds two. He is seriously injured and his athletics career is properly over – lets say its a spinal wound. OP is then charged with murder. I take it then the following is the result: 1. Police investigate the double murder and rape and we all mourn the loss of two celebrities; 2. OP is prosecuted with murder and sent to jail for 15 years. 3 OP might be able to raise a defense of self-defense and is freed. He is paralyzed and has a record of a murder charge on his criminal clearance which precludes him from traveling to many countries. Is this the correct interpretation of law of self-defense?

(maggsnaidu@hotmail.com) Muslim ‘killer’ refused bail The Krugersdorp Regional Court denied bail to murder accused Roedolf Viviers on Tuesday. “The applicant failed dismally to prove to this court that it would be in the interest of justice to release him on bail. Bail is therefore denied,” said magistrate Reginald Dama. Viviers and another man, Zayne van Tonder (33), allegedly insulted Muhammad Fayaaz Kazi and his friend Anser Mahmood about their beards at a Chicken Licken outlet in Magaliesburg on 6 August 2012. An argument and a fight ensued. Kazi was severely beaten and died in hospital. Charges against Van Tonder were later dropped and he was released. Kazi’s brothers Mohammed Nuaman (22) and Mohammed Farhan (18) shouted “Praise Allah” when Dama made his ruling.

Pretoria - After reports emerged Sunday that Oscar Pistorius was "on the verge of suicide," lawyers for the Olympian sprinter are returning to court to seek lighter bail terms that would allow Pistorius to drink alcohol and travel overseas. State prosecutors said Monday that they would contest Pistorius's appeal to have his bail conditions amended, South Africa's News 24 reported. "As the state, we are going to oppose that application," said Medupe Simasiku, regional spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, to The Associated Press. Pistorius was arrested and charged with premeditated murder in the killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. Read more... Pistorius defence rests case, date set for final arguments Pistorius to begin a month of daily tests to assess mental state Pistorius accused of 'sinister' remark to witness Prosecutors say he intended to kill Steenkamp as she cowered in fear behind the locked bathroom door after a loud argument between the two. The 26-year-old track star doesn't deny killing the model and law school graduate at his Pretoria home last month, but said he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder. He described "a sense of terror rushing over" him and feeling vulnerable because he stood only on his stumps before opening fire, the AP writes. He was released on $113,000 bail last month after Magistrate Desmond Nair agreed with his lawyers that he wasn't a flight risk. "I come to the conclusion that the accused has made a case to be released on bail," Nair said. The conditions for his release include: • Bail of 1 million rand (£74,000; $113,000) paid in cash up front, and proof the rest is available • Must turn in passports and any guns that he owns • Prohibited from drinking alcohol or taking drugs • Cannot leave Pretoria without permission from probation officer, nor can he return to his home in Silverwoods Country Estate--where the shooting happened. • Must report to police station between 07:00 and 13:00 every Monday and Friday Now, his lawyers argue that the evidence presented at his bail hearing showed he is not a flight risk and should have the option of traveling outside South Africa as long as he has official permission. The appeal filed on Friday in the capital’s High Court said there was “no basis in fact or in law” justifying terms under which Pistorius must be supervised by a probation officer and a correctional official. The appeal against the bail conditions also objected to the requirement that Pistorius refrain from using alcohol or any banned substance. "The mere use of any substance with alcohol in it will give rise to a transgression of the wide condition imposed," the appeal said. In addition, the runner should be allowed access to the property at Silverwoods Country Estate where he shot Steenkamp, once the State completes its investigations there within a "reasonable time limit", according to Pistorius's legal camp. "A blanket restriction on speaking to residents is unfair" and infringes on Pistorius's rights to consult people on the estate to prepare for his trial, the appeal said. The surprising move comes after reports said that Pistorius was distraught and contemplating taking his life. "He has no confidence in his tone of voice and he is almost like someone that is walking around in circles and doesn't know where he is going," Pistorius family friend Mike Azzie said in a new BBC3 documentary airing tonight, "Oscar Pistorius: What Really Happened?" "I would say that, just speaking to him, that he is a broken man and that I would go as far to say that he would be on the verge of suicide. It really worries me." Azzie said. ***Update: His family has just announced that Pistorius is not suicidal. Pistorius "is in deep mourning but despite the tragic circumstances he is certainly not suicidal," said a statement issued Monday by Pistorius' uncle, Arnold Pistorius, according to ESPN. He said Pistorius has support from his family and is spending time reading the Bible. Pistorius is due back in the lower court June 4, but it is unlikely that the trial will start before the last quarter of the year, ABC news reported. article:345411:12::0 Share on Facebook       More about Oscar pistorius, Reeva Steenkamp, Bail, Premeditated murder, Suicide More news from Oscar pistorius Reeva Steenkamp Bail Premeditated murder Suicide More from Sports Denver Broncos boss steps down, keeps franchise in the family Commonwealth Games Glasgow 2014 Special Robbie Rogers: Young openly gay soccer star inspires sitcom idea 2014 NFL Power Rankings: Sleeper teams to watch this season NFL News and Rumors: Top position battles to watch in camp   Social Comments ()   Digital Journal Comments (5) Sports Video Latest News Top News Astronomy: Most precise measurement of exoplanet to date Panic!

Rich Dad Education Buzzing on Yahoo Sports: Ballplayers engage in national anthem standoff Fourth-Place Medal Oscar Pistorius described as ‘on verge of suicide’ as lawyers seek reduced bail terms [UPDATE: Family disputes 'suicidal' description] By Jay Busbee March 11, 2013 9:14 AM Fourth-Place Medal shares Content preferences Done View photo . Oscar Pistorius. (Getty Images) Oscar Pistorius is "on the verge of suicide," a close friend says, even as his attorneys are seeking lighter bail terms that would allow Pistorius to travel. [UPDATE: The Pistorius family has taken issue with that characterization. See below.] Pistorius, free on bail but charged with the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, is the subject of a new BBC3 documentary, "Oscar Pistorius: What Really Happened." Pistorius maintains that he shot Steenkamp by accident, but South African police believe he intentionally killed her in the course of a heated argument. [Related: Oscar Pistorius' lawyers appeal bail conditions] In the course of the BBC3 documentary, Pistorius family friend Mike Azzie has some dire words about the Olympic and Paralympic star: "I would say that, just speaking to him, that he is a broken man and that I would go as far to say that he would be on the verge of suicide. It really worries me." Azzie also notes that Pistorius continues to speak of Steenkamp, asking friends to pray for her and her family. But there's no force behind his words: "He has no confidence in his tone of voice," Azzie says. "He is just a man that is almost like someone that is walking around in circles and doesn't know where he is going." Meanwhile, Pistorius' lawyers have filed a request with the court to ease the bail restrictions on Pistorius, allowing him to travel outside the country with appropriate permission. They maintain that he is not a flight risk and should be allowed to travel. Pistorius' legal bills are mounting; local reports indicate that he has had to sell racehorses to pay legal bills. Police are reportedly not interested in striking a plea bargain deal with Pistorius' lawyers for any lesser charges. UPDATE: In response to Azzie's words, Pistorius' family has released a statement denying that he is suicidal. Pistorius "is in deep mourning but despite the tragic circumstances he is certainly not suicidal," said his uncle Arnold Pistorius. "From the moment we were first informed about the dreadful event of the early morning of 14 February 2013, we have worked hard to come to terms with the sad news of Reeva Steenkamp's death and Oscar's role in it," the statement read. "Oscar, broken as he currently is, believes he has a purpose in life and is working towards that." -Follow Jay Busbee on Twitter at @jaybusbee.- More news from the Yahoo!

The replacement of investigator Hilton Botha by the South African Police Service came after a third dramatic day of testimony at Pistorius' bail hearing in Pretoria where he stands accused of premeditated murder. The athlete, known as Blade Runner, has admitted shooting girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29, through the bathroom door, thinking she was a burglar. Realising his mistake, he claims he broke the door down with a cricket bat and carried the model downstairs.

Sleeping on a tiny bunk with little ventilation and fears of violence and rape: The notorious South African jail Pistorius faces if he loses bail application Blade Runner's hopes of getting bail soar after prosecution admits embarrassing blunders and courtroom laughs at bumbling policeman In a dramatic twist it emerged that Detective Botha has been charged with seven counts of attempted murder relating to an incident in October 2011 and is due to appear in court himself in May with two other police officers, accused of firing shots at a minibus which had seven people inside. The case was previously dropped but he was charged yesterday, to the surprise of prosecutors in the Pistorius case. This afternoon it was announced that the police officer who will take over as lead investigator on the Pistorius case is Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo. Ms Phiyega said the case would 'receive attention at the national level' and Mr Moonoo would 'gather a team of highly skilled and experience detectives.'  VIDEO  INSIDE COURT Pistorius and Botha present for third day of bail hearing  INSIDE COURT Pistorius \& Botha present for third day of bail... Courtroom ordeal: Detective Hilton Botha, who gave evidence against the Paralympian yesterday in front of a laughing courtroom, is accused of drunkenly firing at a minicab Axed: South Africa's top detective was put in charge of the case after Detective Hilton Botha (pictured), who had led the investigation, was removed when it emerged he and two other officers face attempted murder charges NIKE SUSPENDS PISTORIUS' CONTRACT Nike has suspended its contract with poster boy Oscar Pistorius. The company's now infamous ad showed 26-year-old Pistorius powering out of a set of sprinting blocks, wearing his prosthetic blades, alongside the words 'I Am The Bullet In The Chamber'. 'We believe Oscar Pistorius should be afforded due process and we will continue to monitor the situation closely,' Nike said in a brief statement posted on its website today. On Monday, eyewear maker Oakley suspended its contract with Pistorius. Nike dropped Lance Armstrong in October 2012, citing insurmountable evidence that he participated in doping and misled the company about those activities for more than a decade. But the Beaverton, Oregon-based company stood by Tiger Woods after he admitted to infidelities and went to rehab for sex addiction. Pistorius was born without fibula bones due to a congenital defect, and had his legs amputated at 11 months. He runs on carbon-fiber blades and was originally banned from competing against able-bodied peers because many argued that his blades gave him an unfair advantage. In 2008, however, the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared him to compete against the fastest in the world. Pistorius is a multiple Paralympic medalist, but he failed to win a medal at the London Olympics, where he ran in the 400 meters and on South Africa's 4x400 relay team. He won a silver medal with his country's 4x400 relay team at the 2011 world championships in Daegu, South Korea. Det Botha, who gave evidence at Pistorius' bail hearing yesterday, was summoned back to the witness box today where he was questioned by Magistrate Desmond Nair. The detective told the court the case against him had previously been dropped, and said he was not drunk and was chasing suspects at the time. Pistorius' family were once again on the front row to support him - they shed the funereal black and his brother Carl wore a stripey jacket. When the court when into recess, Carl walked through the gallery shaking hands with supporters. The 26-year-old's chances of winning bail appeared to increase dramatically today after the embarrassing series of blunders and confusion in the prosecution case yesterday. Detective Warrant Officer Hilton Botha, the first officer to arrive at the house, also admits he had compromised the crime scene with ‘unprotected shoes’ Prosecution admitting they originally missed a bullet cartridge in the toilet basin Det Botha calling the substance found in Pistorius' bedroom 'steroids' only to be corrected by the prosecution that it was a box of 'testosterone' Det Botha at first saying he had a statement from someone 600m away, then changing that to 300m, and later saying he was not sure Det Botha agreeing defence lawyer that police had no evidence challenging the runner's claim he accidentally killed his girlfriend in a bathroom, believing it was an intruder Today's proceedings began with prosecutor Gerrie Nel confirming to the court that Det Botha was facing seven attempted murder charges. 'The case [against Botha] was originally dropped but now it has been reinstated,' Mr Nel said. Det Botha was not initially in court and Magistrate Desmond Nair had to ask for him to be found. On arrival in the courtroom the detective admitted he had not yet obtained telephone or financial records for Miss Steenkamp. After being told by Mr Nair that there appeared to have been a lack of urgency in getting them, he admitted it should have been done. Moving on to discussing a possible flight risk, Prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court he has a copy of Afrikaans magazine, Sarie, that features Pistorius and his sister Aimee. In the interview Pistorius says: 'I spend 4 months a year in South Africa, have house in Italy and spend 4 months a year there, its quiet and tranquil.' Yesterday the defence stated categorically that Pistorius had no such house in Italy, but Det Botha claimed the athlete had a house in Italy as evidence to suggest he could be a flight risk. Today Mr Nel told the hearing the Italian house is not owned by Pistorius, but it is on loan to him. Pistorius' defence lawyer Mr Roux said the onus was on the state to show that it was in the interests of justice for Pistorius to remain in prison, saying: 'The evidence does not even show that the applicant committed a murder. 'The poor quality of the evidence presented by chief investigating officer Botha exposed disastrous shortcomings in the state's case.'  VIDEO  Detective Hilton Botha replaced as lead detective in the case   Lead detective in PIstorius case replaced Media spotlight:Pistorius faces a barrage of photographers as he stands at Magistrate's Court for the third day of his bail hearing Front row support: Pistorius' family were once again on the front row to support him yesterday World watching: In front of the cameras it was difficult to Pistorius' family to talk freely - it looked like at one point his sister Aimee, 23, was covering her mouth to talk to a supporter Support: Aimee Pistorius centre, looks over as she brother walks into the courtroom and stands in the dock. In an interview Pistorius said his younger sister was his 'best friend' Recess: Oscar Pistorius' sister Aimee and father Henke confer during a break in court proceedings At one point the magistrate overseeing the bail hearing briefly cleared the court saying there was a 'threat' outside the building after being handed a piece of paper. Pistorius was hurried out of the court, but returned five minutes later and the bail hearing resumed. In the same grey suit, blue shirt and grey tie combination he has worn throughout the bail hearing, the double-amputee stood ramrod straight in the dock, then sat calmly looking at his hands On Tuesday and Wednesday, the athlete had been slumped over and sobbing uncontrollably at times as detail was read out of how Steenkamp died in his house. Flight risk: Prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court in Afrikaans magazine, Sarie, that features Pistorius and his sister Aimee, he says he has an Italy home This afternoon Mr Roux said poor-quality evidence by Det Botha had exposed disastrous shortcomings in the state's case. He said he had been selective with what he said and determined to 'bolster the state's case', but could not refute Pistorius' version of what happened. Mr Roux said Steenkamp staying with the Paralympian was consistent with a loving relationship, and that after she was shot, evidence suggested Pistorius was desperate to save her life. He said the fact there was no urine in her bladder suggested she had got up to go to the toilet and if Pistorius had shouted about an intruder, it was likely she would have locked the door adding: 'The evidence is not that the applicant knew the toilet was locked when he fired the shots.' Mr Nair asked: 'Do you think there will be some level of shock if the accused is released?' Defence lawyer Barry Roux responded: 'I think there will be a level of shock in this country if he is not released.' Yesterday Det Botha claimed Pistorius was involved in another shooting at a restaurant in Johannesburg in January and asked the gun owner to take responsibility for the incident. Today Mr Roux said the discharge of the gun was an accident and if it was used to deny bail it would be a 'terrible injustice.' He also said that using the allegations that Pistorius then asked a friend to take responsibility as grounds to suggest he would influence witnesses would be unfair. He claimed Det Botha had been selective with what he said, and seemed determined to 'bolster the state's case'.  Step by step: Oscar Pistorius' account of how the events unfolded at his upscale Pretoria home on Valentine's Day 'THIS MONTH IS GOING TO BE AMAZING': REEVA STEENKAMP'S EMAIL TO BEST FRIEND Reeva Steenkamp's best friend Gina Myers has spoken of how her the model predicted February was going to be a 'big month.'  Gina Myers said in an interview: 'The irony of it is that she actually sent me a message at the beginning at month saying 'G this month is going to be amazing. 'It's going to change our lives forever!' Ms Myers said her close friend wanted to get married and have children in the future. 'She used to see kids and say G I am so excited to have kids - just not now!' 'This was going to be a very big year for her,' she said. The defence lawyer repeated assertions made yesterday that Mr Botha could not refute Pistorius' version of what happened. Pistorius sobbed again in court as Mr Roux summed up his case. After a short break the prosecution summed up their case for why Pistorius should not be allowed bail. Opposing bail, prosecutor Gerrie Nel painted a picture of a man 'willing and ready to fire and kill,' and said signs of remorse from Pistorius do not mean that the athlete didn't intend to kill his girlfriend. 'Even if you plan a murder, you plan a murder and shoot. If you fire the shot, you have remorse. Remorse might kick in immediately,' Nel said. Mr Nel said the onus was not on the state, but on Pistorius, to prove he should be given bail. The prosecutor stressed that Pistorius shouldn't be given special treatment and asked if the Paralympian thought: 'I'm Oscar Pistorius, I'm a world renowned athlete, that in itself is special', was an argument for exceptional circumstances. 'He (Pistorius) wants to continue with his life like this never happened,' Nel went on, prompting Pistorius, who was crying softly, to shake his head. He said Pistorius' version of events was improbable and his actions that night were indicative of a man ready and willing to fire to kill. 'The reason you fire four shots is to kill,' Mr Nel persisted. Mr Nel said the prosecution is sceptical that Pistorius got up in the night and walked past the bed twice and did not notice Miss Steenkamp was missing. VIDEO: Reeva was passionate about violence against women says best friend   Reeva was passionate about violence against women says best... Scene of horror: This is the toilet cubicle where Reeva Steenkamp was found 'slumped over but alive' after being shot three times through the locked door He questioned why he fetched his firearm from the side where Miss Steenkamp was sleeping, but did not say: 'Reeva, Reeva, have you heard something? Did you hear a noise?' Mr Nel criticised the fact that Pistorius gave a written affidavit rather than spoken evidence saying no-one can test a written affidavit. He asserted that the Pistorius' claim of being a victim of death threats and crime was 'just for dramatic effect.' Charges: Prosecutors believe that Reeva Steenkamp sought refuge in the bathroom after arguing with the athlete dubbed Blade Runner Mr Nel said: 'The uncontradicted, unchallenged evidence of the position of his cellphone and gun are the coup de grace for his case. He claimed the position of phones belonging to Pistorius and Miss Steenkamp on the bathroom mat suggested they had been having an argument there and asked why the model would have taken her phone into the bathroom otherwise. But the magistrate, Desmond Nair, said Pistorius might have put them there after the killing. As Mr Nel summed up the prosecution's case opposing bail, the world famous athlete began to weep in the crowded courtroom, leading his brother, Carl Pistorius, to reach out and touch his back. Pistorius' family looked disappointed as they filed out the hearing after the magistrate explained that administrative requirements of courthouse meant the hearing was postponed until tomorrow morning. The case has already been plagued by blunders - just hours after the Det Botha told the athlete's bail hearing performance enhancing drug testosterone and steroids had been found at his mansion home, prosecutors changed their story. In a humiliating U-turn, a spokesman for South Africa’s National Prosecution Agency said there had been an error in the evidence of Det Botha when he identified the ‘testosterone’ in the bedroom. Medupe Simasiku said it is too early to identify the substance as it is still undergoing testing. There had been gasps in court when Det Botha – a policeman for 24 years – and prosecutors claimed testosterone had been found together with needles. But Mr Roux said yesterday: ‘It is a herbal remedy, it is not a steroid and it is not a banned substance.’ He also confronted Botha over contaminating the crime scene. ‘You were in the house walking with unprotected shoes. That should not happen,’ he said. The detective admitted he should not have been. There was laughter in the court when magistrate Desmond Nair asked Botha about his belief that if granted bail, Pistorius would flee South Africa. Mr Nair said: ‘I’m sure we would both agree that his face is widely recognised internationally. ‘Do you subjectively believe that he would take the opportunity, being who he is, using prosthetics to get around, to flee South Africa?” Botha responded: ‘Yes.’ VIDEO: Pistorius returns to court to hear that bail hearing is adjourned   Pistorius returns to court to hear that bail hearing is adjourned The second day of the bail hearing appeared at first to go against Pistorius, with prosecutors saying a witness can testify to hearing ‘non-stop talking, like shouting’ between 2am and 3am before the shooting. However, under cross examination, Botha said the person who overheard the argument was in a house 600 metres away. Later, prosecutor Gerrie Nel questioned the detective who then said the distance was 300 metres. The defence argued that screaming heard coming from the house was Pistorius calling for help from his balcony. Botha also claimed examination of the model’s body and the bathroom door Pistorius fired through suggested he had been wearing his prosthetic legs –directly contradicting the athlete’s claims that he was on his stumps and fired believing an intruder had broken in. ‘I believe that he knew that Reeva was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door,’ the detective told the court. As details were released from Miss Steenkamp’s post mortem showing bullets hit the right side of her head, her hip and right elbow, Pistorius lent forward sobbing and muttered prayers. Earlier, Mr Nel said the killing was premeditated because Pistorius took time to put on his prosthetic legs before the shooting. VIDEO South Africans react.

What is there to Wow o, Nigerians and their ignorance! Bail is not a declaration of one's independence. In simple english,It has been determined by the court that he is not going to run away before the trial,hence bail was granted to him.

This case is a strange one, different stories which we all might say are true or false. Oscar was merited bail cause it was deemed possible. There are different angles to this trial but I personally think Oscar didn't kill Steenkamp. I might be wrong but looking at the evidences from what I've seen on the tv I've concluded that Oscar would indeed come out clean. Let's wait till June 4 and I want to beg your Nigerian readers not to crucify me. These are my views and I have the right to air them. I reside in SA and I'm a citizen of that wonderful country so I know what I'm saying. I'm not deluded or anything. Oscar would come out clean. Cheers. February 22, 2013 at 4:36 PM Eya Ayambem said...

You could not be more obvious about your feelings regarding the guilt of this man. In developed countries with the rule of law, defendants are granted bail if they are not a flight risk to prepare their defense. Lets wait for all the evidence to come out before we persecute this guy. I know you are just a blogger but you could still be fair in your reporting. The headline gives you up and the wow at the end was unnecessary. So he shouldn’t be granted bail even if he killed his girl friend in cold blood? Where is Oscar Pestorious going to hide if he runs away? What if it was accidental killing as he said, should we remand him to Kirikiri even before he’s found guilty?

Yes its a murder case, but look at it from this angle; he is disabled (no legs), he needs medical attention too, He will have his day in court and if guilty he will face the consequences but for now, he deserves bail on humanitarian and health grounds, not supporting his actions, but that's the law, even George Zymmerman in the Hoody murder case in the U.S posted bail.

Under the SA law as it also is in Naija, a person is INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY hence they are referred to as SUSPECTS NOT CRIMINALS. So the guy has a right to bail! Moreso, if his attorneys are able to establish the fact he was acting under the influence of any substance then he's likely to get an easy sentence. Its not corruption, ITS THE LAW!!

You have neglected to inform people that the investigationg detective mr hilton was let off the case because he himself is standing trial for multiple attempted murder, u did not mention that there were no signs of battery according to the autopsy report of Reeva. you also neglected to tell people that her bladder was empty at time of death so it is possible that she went to take a piss and was not in the bathroom for cover. as the old saying goes, that which is worth doing is worth doing well.. since were on the topic of credibility. u really should check well and ask parties concerned before u post.. what was that about yvonne nelson and ice prince.. this is not good enuff linda please sit up. cheers ps lindas voltrons i am also teamlinda but the truth must be said..

EDITIONS: USA ESPAÑOL More Australia Brazil United Kingdom CITIES: BOSTON CHICAGO DALLAS LOS ANGELES NEW YORK ESPN Olympic Sports Shop Oscar Pistorius bail limits eased Updated: March 28, 2013, 12:50 PM ET Associated Press Recommend Tweet Comments Email Print Recommend Tweet Comments Email Print Subscribe PRETORIA, South Africa -- Oscar Pistorius can leave South Africa to compete in international track meets, a judge ruled on Thursday as he upheld the Olympic athlete's appeal against some of his bail restrictions. Pistorius' agent told The Associated Press that this year's world championships could be "on the radar." Judge Bert Bam said Pistorius, who is charged with murder in the Valentine's Day shooting death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, must travel under certain conditions. His passport will be held by a court while he is in South Africa, and he can only leave the country if he provides an itinerary of his travel plans at least a week before he is due to leave. Pistorius must also hand his travel documents back to the court within 24 hours of returning home. More on ABCNews.com The latest on the Oscar Pistorius case from the worldwide reporting staff of ABC News. Topics The ruling in a North Gauteng High Court opens the way for the Paralympic champion, who is facing a life sentence if found guilty of murder, to run in international competitions again. Pistorius' agent, Peet van Zyl, told the AP soon after the ruling that Pistorius could even run at the world championships in Moscow in August -- if he wanted to and if he qualified. "Based on this (judge's decision), and if he is up for it and qualifies, the world championships will definitely be on the radar," Van Zyl told the AP by telephone. The judge's decision was "fair," Van Zyl said, but any return to competition would be up to Pistorius, who hasn't run competitively since September or trained for two months. "He's going to be the one that determines running and training," the agent said. "It's his call. He's the one under all the pressure for the court case and grieving for Reeva." Although Pistorius' lawyers said in the appeal hearing that he had no immediate plans to compete, he would likely need to return to track in the future to earn money, they said. Pistorius himself, a double amputee widely known as the Blade Runner for his prosthetic legs, did not attend the court session. "He has no desire to compete now but it might change and it will change," defense lawyer Barry Roux told the judge in arguing for some of Pistorius' bail restrictions to be eased. Roux said Pistorius would not try and evade trial if he is allowed to travel internationally, and would eventually need to run again "to earn an income." "He is not going to run away and hide. He is going nowhere," Roux told the judge in the brown-walled courtroom in the high court, where television cameras and photographers were allowed in to record the proceedings. "Why stop him from traveling under controlled circumstances?" Roux added. Pistorius says he killed Steenkamp accidentally when he fired shots through a door in his bathroom in the pre-dawn hours, fearing there was an intruder in his house. Prosecutors say he shot the model and reality TV star intentionally after they argued, and they have charged him with premeditated murder. Pistorius' last competitive race was his victory in the 400 meters final at the London Paralympics in September last year. He hasn't trained or "seen a track" for around nine weeks, agent Van Zyl said, but when he was ready they would consider both able-bodied and Paralympic events. Van Zyl saw no reason why Pistorius shouldn't be allowed to run again while accused of murder and told The AP that he had been contacted by race promoters who wanted to see Pistorius return to competition. "At the end of the day we'll have to see what governing bodies will say. It will be interesting to see," Van Zyl said. "If they don't allow him to run and he walks out (of court) a free man, there might be a problem." In court on Thursday, the judge also ruled in favor of Pistorius on three other conditions. He no longer has to be regularly supervised by a probation official and a ruling that he wasn't allowed to consume alcohol and could be tested at any time for alcohol and "prohibited substances" was lifted. Bam also slammed one of the bail conditions imposed by another judge, saying that a condition that he would be in breach of his bail if he was accused of another crime against women was "fraud." It went against Pistorius' constitutional right to be innocent until proven guilty, and being accused of a crime should not count against him, Bam said. The high court judge's rapid ruling came three hours after the hearing began. Another two restrictions that Pistorius was not allowed to return to his house, where he shot Steenkamp dead on Feb. 14, and had to report regularly to a police station should be "disregarded," the judge said, as they weren't in Nair's written court order. It meant Pistorius' legal team succeeded in all its appeals. Pistorius' lawyers smiled after the judge ruled in their favor. The prosecution wouldn't comment on how the ruling affected its case, but said it believed Pistorius would comply with the new conditions. "As the prosecution, we are not going to make any comment in as far as the judgment is concerned," National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Medupe Simasiku said. "Our focus is on the upcoming trial and we need to focus on that with all our minds. "The investigation is going well and we believe that soon it will be completed. And when it is completed, that is when we'll know about the trial date," he said. The athlete's lawyers had earlier argued that he was being treated as a flight risk by his bail restrictions even though a magistrate ruled last month that he was not when he released Pistorius on 1 million rand ($108,000) bail. Defense lawyer Roux said Pistorius' original bail restrictions amounted to "house arrest." He also argued against a ruling that prevented him from speaking to residents near his home, saying he should be allowed to consult with them to prepare his defense. Prosecutors had opposed the relaxing of Pistorius' bail restrictions and also said the appeal should have gone to the original magistrate's court that set bail for Pistorius, and not Pretoria's high court. Chief Magistrate Desmond Nair imposed the bail conditions on Feb. 22. Pistorius had been held in a police station until then. He hasn't been seen in public since and is believed to have been staying at an uncle's house. Pistorius was not required to attend his appeal hearing and none of his family members was present at North Gauteng High Court in the heart of South Africa's capital city. Pistorius' next court appearance is June 4, when the prosecution would aim to serve indictments, chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court. Nel said there is a possibility that Pistorius' trial will begin by the end of the year. Pistorius' bail appeal was being heard at the high court a day after the athlete's older brother, Carl Pistorius, went on trial for culpable homicide for the death of a woman motorcyclist in a 2008 road accident. Carl Pistorius pleaded not guilty Wednesday to the main charge of culpable homicide and not guilty to two alternative charges relating to driving recklessly and inconsiderately.
