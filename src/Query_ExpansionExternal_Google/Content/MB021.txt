Second City Cop Sarcasm and Silliness from a Windy City Cop Monday, January 31, 2011 Media Picks Up on Residency Evidently, someone at the main stream media noticed the same thing our readers did - t he Illinois Supreme Court language is opening a door: The heads of the Chicago police and firefighter unions are commenting today on how the residency ruling for mayoral candidate Rahm Emanuel might affect the rule requiring city workers to live within the city limits. Mark Donahue, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, says he’s tried for the past few years to get the legislature to change the law so Chicago police could go to the bargaining table with the city and negotiate over whether police could live in the suburbs. Donahue says the FOP will make that legislative push again this session. Donahue says he doesn’t know whether any legal connection can be made between yesterday’s Illinois Supreme Court ruling for Emanuel and the city’s employment rule. Chicago Firefighter Union leader Tom Ryan says he’s had members who’ve lost their jobs because they didn’t live in the city of Chicago. He says he doesn’t know whether yesterday’s Illinois Supreme Court ruling will have a bearing on those or any other cases. As was pointed out in our comment section some time ago, the national FOP regularly wins residency lawsuits. Their winning percentage approaches that of the NRA's record over nonsense gun laws. And from what we see in the comment sections of the various media sites covering this portion of the story, most people would be happy to have the police move out of their neighborhoods. The words "no great loss," "leave already," "it's police kids who are the problem" appear with startling regularity. We had no idea that there was so much support for police and firefighters leaving the city. Labels: city politics posted by SCC at 12:05 AM 62 Comments:   Anonymous said... "We had no idea that there was so much support for police and firefighters leaving the city." Fuck 'em. I will do less and less for the citizens, move way the hell away from here, and rent my house to a dope dealin' gang-bangin' piece of shit from 005, 006, 007, 010, 011, 015. Then lets see how much my "Neighbors" will miss me. 1/31/2011 12:09:00 AM     Anonymous said... Yeah, but there are cops who think they will lose value on their homes if residency is lifted. Delusional thinking. Cops don't mean as much to a neighborhood as they think. A small percentage of city workers would leave. No big deal. 1/31/2011 12:21:00 AM     Anonymous said... Other issues that should be addressed. OUT of GRADE PAY to be PENSIONABLE. This would encourage the city to make more timely promotions an rely less on "actors". Contributions by personnel could be voluntary or returnable like when someone gives up a paygrade. RETIRED OFFICERS TO BE COMPENSATED WHEN THEY ARE CALLED TO COURT TO TESTIFY. Cold cases and DNA hits are bringing long lost offenders to justice after the cops involved have pulled to pin. It's not just a matter of "just don't answer the phone" or dodging subpoenas. There are cases I would like to see closed before they close my casket. I'd just like to get paid for it. 1/31/2011 12:24:00 AM     Anonymous said... Donahue doesn't know!? He is clueless then. Anyone can make the connection from the decision. Duh. Emmanuel argued that by owning property that made him a resident. He even changed his tax declarations...so yes the connection be made. Now finding good lawyers and not regular FOP lawyers to fight his is key to winning. Perhaps we need to hire Emmanuel's lawyers :) they seem better then the current FOP all together. Good that this was brought up. 1/31/2011 12:25:00 AM     Anonymous said... Lifting residency is what finished off Detroit. 1/31/2011 12:28:00 AM     Anonymous said... It doesn't matter what the court says, the decision only applies to special people with political connections. Look to see the judges to get federal appointments or other sots after the smoke clears. Nothing will change for because these so called judges should have never even been lawyers in the first place. They apply the law as they see fit for their friends. 1/31/2011 12:30:00 AM     Anonymous said... Yea thanks to Rahm and corrupt judges that opens the door to getting rid of anyone ever buying a city sticker again. You can now live here (why) and say youbare a resident somewhere else because you will eventually want to move there. Oops.

"Civilians armed with knives, axes, golf clubs, firebombs, metal bars and makeshift spears watched over many neighborhoods in the sprawling capital of 18 million this weekend, defending their families and homes against widespread looting and lawlessness."

I dont know about the average joe, but I would rather live with Cops on both sides of me and across the street than sec-8 hood rats, bangers, dope boys, baby mama and her new man, various ghetto heads etc. After all, I would prefer to surround myself with people that have passed backround checks and take regular drug tests. Call me conservative but this would seem to be the less risk of coming home from work to find my TV stolen. If I ever decide to buy into a Chicago 'hood (and im not), you had best believe I would try to go where CPD and CFD goes. I dont care if someone has a brat kid, that can happen anywhere. 1/31/2011 01:25:00 AM     Anonymous said... When Chico is in residency is a mute issue.

I think the difference here is the fact that Rahm left the City of Chicago to go and work in Washington BUT kept his Chicago home. Paid taxes on it, and returned to it when he decided, or Obama decided he should run for mayor. If we get to move to the suburbs then are we willing to keep our Chicago home like he did. 1/31/2011 08:01:00 AM     Anonymous said... Can't confirm this for sure, but it is rumored that Rahm, likely to be the next Mayor, ran into a couple of officers at an L Train stop the other day. The officers asked him about the pension plan and he basically stated that he is not going to lie to them yes he will probably reduce the pension in fact we might be lucky if he gives us back the money we put in. Why is F.O.P sitting on their azz, making us look like the bad guys, when we have contributed our share to the pension fund for years, while the city has dodged their end and mismanaged our money. With Rahm it's going to be the same old BS and maybe even worse. Hopefully city workers and family members show this political clown that is riding off the President’s coat tell that the entire city does not back him for Mayor. 1/31/2011 09:07:00 AM     Anonymous said... Get yourself an apartment building. You can rent out your unit, as long as you intend to return, problem solved. I've seen abandoned buildings in englewood going for less than 10k. I saw a 6flat in 003 for 36k, if you fix it up you will make money on the deal and can live in the burbs legally. 1/31/2011 09:39:00 AM     Anonymous said... Not even elected to office yet and Rahm is fucking the city up. -not a cop 1/31/2011 09:45:00 AM     Bill said... A few things to ponder if the Res Rule is lifted: what happens when whole neighborhoods full of homes go on sale all at once? Prices plummet, people sell at a loss just to get the hell out before "they" move in. See Chicago's South and West Sides, circa 1960-1975. So, if the city lifts its rule, and the large percentage of cops and firemen and city workers (CFCWs) now clustered in the far northwest and southwest sides pack up the minivans to head for Oak Lawn and Niles, when CFCWs come into the city to work daily, they'll have several more crappy neighborhoods to deal with. Might make redistricting an easier sell, though, without the CFCWs keeping heat on their aldremen to keep cops in their districts. Second, what happens when so many homes all go on the market in this shitty economy? Will there even be buyers? Realtors are putting up For Sale signs nowadays with permanent concrete foundations they're gonna be there that long. CFCWs might put their bungalows and ranch-styles on the market and never get a buyer. But I don't think this would happen, because as much as many CFCWs want to leave the city, lots of their spouses and kids don't. People have connections to neighborhood institutions--parish, school, merchants, bartenders, neighbors, friends--and won't all want to just up and go. But I'd bet we'll never know. Chico and Rahm saying they'd "discuss" the issue is just an attempt to get some votes. 1/31/2011 09:58:00 AM     Anonymous said... Under this decision any city worker can absoluteley rent their property out and reside in the burbs with the "intention" of returning back to the city some day. We all know Rahm would still be living in DC if Daley didn't decide to retire. 1/31/2011 10:22:00 AM     Anonymous said... The problem with the comparison is that Rahm was not working for the city of Chicago while he lived in Washington. 1/31/2011 10:36:00 AM     Suburbanite said... THINK TWICE. Lifting residency may look good but wait til you have to start commuting in rush hour. And you better look at what you you going to pay in property taxes - AND WATER BILLS. Living in the suburbs costs money - a lot more than what you think. You're not going to get a home in Hinsdale or Western Springs, maybe Berwyn. Check not only the house prices - check the property taxes. There are no bargains out there. As they say - the grass looks greener on the other side. It isn't - it just costs more money. 1/31/2011 10:45:00 AM     Anonymous said... Set my people free! 1/31/2011 10:48:00 AM     Anonymous said...

I am one of the Officers. He related to us that the city can not sustain the pension system as is and that we must work with him to help balance the cities financial deficit. To keep the pensions as is he would have to raise property taxes 90% or impliment a City Income Tax. He would like to lower our maximum pension of 75 % to 60 %. Thats ALL city pensions not just CPDs. 1/31/2011 05:59:00 PM     Anonymous said... It will come down to, "did you have to live in the city of chicago to apply for the CPD?" No, you didnt have to move in until you got the job. I know what the Rahm law says, but thats how it will be determined in the courts. 1/31/2011 06:03:00 PM     The Box Chevy Phantom said... We're having a hard time reconciling the public hatred and disdain for The Police with the public concern and hand-wringing about where The Police live and raise their families. Why so much concern about where a group of "overcompensated" insensitive, uncaring, brutal some-kind-of-phobes lay their heads? We reckon it isn't enough to work a job that takes good years off your life and deprives your families and loved ones the comparative amount of time afforded to those who don't do trade in the grief, aggravation, anger and frustration peculiar to the institution of Chicago Policing? Of course the smug, self satisfied and intellectually lazy response of "you knew what it would be like when you signed up" is conveniently trotted out during times like these. Well... We DID sign up to serve honorably and in good faith. Or at least to the point that conditions would allow. We DID NOT sign up to be constantly maligned, mistreated, lied to, cheated and relegated to second class citizenship just because we wear a blue suit of clothes. A dog will bite the shit out of you if you beat it regularly. Men anywhere on this planet WILL push back if not FIGHT if they're constantly maligned, marginalized and told "fuck you and your concerns" repeatedly. People easily forget that Policemen didn't fall from the sky. Policemen ARE a cross section of society. Meh... so much easier to live in glass houses and fling bricks. But again... Why so much concern about where we hang our hats? Or are they actually afraid the hated Police are actually going to be able to pick up and leave them for the animals? "How DARE they not care about us!" "Keep the coppers here in the city, then they'll have a stake in the community." But if the community is all in on the Daley Inc. media propaganda campaign of (rather well orchestrated to boot) of "fuck you and your concerns, you're why the city is broke/the country is in a depression/we're eating our 401K's/we're underwater on our house/crime is out of control," etc. Should The Police get mad and fight back? Or is that right and reasonable expectation only reserved for those who aren't Chicago Policemen? "We'll destroy your lives and livelihoods, steal from you and deny you every bit of your humanity and dignity but we have rules that say you can't do anything about it but to grin and bear it." Tell us how you really feel Chicago... Don't hold back on our accounts. It would seem that the very idea of Chicago Policing has been killed by the citizens themselves. Soon to be a quaint and archaic notion just like "taking back the streets." 1/31/2011 06:06:00 PM     Anonymous said...

I hate being told where to live myself as much as the next guy, but I do think the pension issue is more important right now. In 9 years, I will be able to retire and draw from a 20 year pension. I want to take that money and supplement a lower paying, more satisfying part time career. I want to have my pension there to help me pay my bills after I gave 22 of my best years to this job. No respect, working horrible hours, being left out of family get togethers, missing special events, being attacked, harrassed, injured, etc... some of these on a daily baises. Credit and character all affected by frivilous lawsuits being brought upon us by bottom feeding law firms, just for City payouts to low class criminals, when an Officer just does his job. I want the pension that was promised as a benefit of the job I swore to do. You see, we agreed to uphold the law, live in the City, and about a million other things. I, and thousands of others, agreed to and have kept our end of the deal. Now it's time for the City to hold up their end of the deal. There is a possibility that I will see at least 3 or 4 New Superintendents, 2 to 3 Mayors, and a couple new Presidents over my final stretch. I don't think the best person will ever be chose for any of those job's, but the rest of us that are actually doing our job's should be properly compensated. It's the least we should expect and it should not be messed with. It is the only light at the end of the Public Servants job. Our driving force. 2/01/2011 01:48:00 PM     Anonymous said...

No respect, working horrible hours, being left out of family get togethers, missing special events, being attacked, harrassed, injured, etc... some of these on a daily baises. Credit and character all affected by frivilous lawsuits being brought upon us by bottom feeding law firms, just for City payouts to low class criminals, when an Officer just does his job. I want the pension that was promised as a benefit of the job I swore to do. You see, we agreed to uphold the law, live in the City, and about a million other things. I, and thousands of others, agreed to and have kept our end of the deal. Now it's time for the City to hold up their end of the deal. There is a possibility that I will see at least 3 or 4 New Superintendents, 2 to 3 Mayors, and a couple new Presidents over my final stretch. I don't think the best person will ever be chose for any of those job's, but the rest of us that are actually doing our job's should be properly compensated. It's the least we should expect and it should not be messed with. It is the only light at the end of the Public Servants job. Our driving force. 2/01/2011 01:48:00 PM ------------- Well said! 2/01/2011 02:57:00 PM     Anonymous said... I retired and live in the burbs. Yes, taxes and fees a a bit higher then on the south side of the city, but not that much. And as compared to the north side, many good burbs are comparable or lower! Yes, you can move to Orland, Tinley, Hinsdale, Arlington, Westchester. It should be your choice. And, don't kid yourself, there are a few lousy schools in the burbs, but most of them are far better then any chicago public school. The fact is, some surburbannites send their kids to catholic schools in the city. This should be your families choice after you do some research. I doubt that most city employees would move out in the first place. I have many retired police friends who still live in the city and have no intention of moving. Do not give in to the fear tactics about taxes, schools and commuting. This should be your individual and family choice and not dictated by a mayor or alderman who wants to keep you as a serf. 2/01/2011 04:09:00 PM     Anonymous said...

You don't really think that the City is just going to say "Go live anywhere you want," do you? They'll put a restriction on where you can live, just like most of the burbs do, such as 15-20 mile radius of the City. Also, what NYC does is charge city workers a tax of either 5 or 7% of your pay if you reside outside of the 5 boroughs on NYC. Don't for a minute think that they wouldn't do the same or MORE (10-15% city "income tax" to non-residents)How about "Only cars with valid Chicago city stickers allowed to park in City facility lots," here if they got rid of city residency. They will make it so that it would be cheaper to stay in the City than not. Not to mention that housing in the "radius area" allowed by the city would go up in price. Nothing like sell low in the City, buy high in the burbs, pay a city income tax, buy a city and your new home burb city sticker, and pay higher burb property taxes and a high-ass water bill. Be careful what you wish for. 2/03/2011 11:35:00 AM   Post a Comment << Home Newer Posts.......................... ..........................Older Posts Contributors SCC SCC (retired) Previous Posts New Old Teams - Again?

Daley, Middle Class, police officers, Residency Get Breaking News First Receive News, Politics, and Entertainment Headlines Each Morning. Sign Up CHICAGO (CBS) – Without a residency requirement for city employees, Chicago would kiss its middle-class goodbye, Mayor Richard M. Daley warned Monday, arguing that other major cities lived to regret it. “If you go to Cleveland, if you go to Detroit, if you go to New York, if you go to Philadelphia — talk to all those mayors. They’ll tell you they lost all their middle class,” Daley said. “Everybody fled the cities — especially public employees,” Daley continued. “In Detroit, they live in Ohio [and work for] the police and fire departments. In San Francisco, they live in Arizona, some of them. They live all over. They don’t live in the city.” Last month, mayoral candidates Gery Chico and Rahm Emanuel responded to a Fraternal Order of Police questionnaire by saying they were open to letting police officers live outside the city. “I think we’re a different city than we were 30, 40, 50 years ago when this rule came on the books,” Chico said of the issue. Chico said Chicago has outgrown the need for a residency requirement to prevent an exodus of the middle class. “If I thought it was threatening to the middle class, I wouldn’t have put it on the table,” Chico said last week of dropping the residency rule. But rivals Carol Moseley Braun and Miguel Del Valle both believe the residency requirement for city employees should continue. “I understand why he’s saying this. He’s obviously pandering to the unions,” Del Valle said of Chico last week. “When I got those questionnaires from the union, I didn’t say that I would be in favor of that. I will not pander to get an endorsement.” There was also talk last week about whether the Illinois Supreme Court ruling that declared Emanuel met the residency requirements to run for mayor could also be applied to police officers and firefighters who want to move out of the city. Mark Donahue, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said last week he has tried for the past few years to get the law changed so Chicago Police could go to the bargaining table with the city and negotiate over whether police could live in the suburbs. Donahue says the FOP will make that legislative push again this session. Donahue says he doesn’t know whether any legal connection can be made between yesterday’s Illinois Supreme Court ruling for Emanuel and the city’s employment rule. Chicago Firefighter Union leader Tom Ryan says he’s had members who’ve lost their jobs because they didn’t live in the city of Chicago. He said he didn’t know whether the Emanuel ruling will have a bearing on those or any other cases.

http://stateofenlightenment.com/2011/01/30/litigating-an-election-rahm-emanuel-and-the-chicago-race-for-mayor/
State of Enlightenment reasoned thought for an age of uncertainty Home Politics Economy Culture About Litigating an Election: Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Race for Mayor 30 January 2011    2 Comments The Illinois court system has had its hands full deciding whether a challenge to Rahm Emanuel’s residency in his bid for mayor should stand.  On Monday, the Appellate Court overturned a Board of Elections decision and removed Emanuel from the ballot, prompting the Supreme Court of Illinois to reverse the decision and order Rahm back on the ballot only three days later.  While this may all seem like typical election-year drama, this type of turnaround is in fact very rare–courts do not like to embarrass their colleagues like this.  Even further, elections are perilous territory for courts, and judges usually are loathe to be dragged into the process, especially because judges are often appointed by the very same candidates they are asked to review.  What is worrisome in this case is the willingness of the two justices on the Appellate Court to issue an opinion so far off the mark and then to deny Emanuel any sort of relief from their order. But first things first: what was the deal with the Rahm Emanuel case anyway?  The issue was whether Rahm abandoned his residency in Chicago when he went to work for Obama. Burt Odelson, the attorney for the plaintiffs, had claimed that Rahm Emanuel failed to established residency in Chicago after he came back from Washington.  This, of course, assumes Rahm had abandoned his residence in the first place, and that what this whole fight was about.  When the Appellate Court reviewed the case, they skipped the step about whether Rahm had abandoned his residence in the first place.  This is a monumental oversight, and it drew an acidic dissent from the third justice on the court, Justice Lampkin, who claimed that the other justices had pulled their decision “out of a hat” and were “meddling” with the election.  Coming from an appellate judge, these are some pretty serious claims. What is even more amazing is that the two ruling judges ordered Rahm’s name immediately stricken from the ballot and, even though the case was bound for appeal, refused to postpone the action.  This of course annoyed the Supreme Court, because then it had to drop everything to prevent the removal of Rahm’s name from the ballot.  So when the Supreme Court issued its decision, it did not hold back its criticism of the Appellate Court, accusing it of “painting on a blank canvas, with no applicable authority to guide it,” calling its logic “hardly compelling and deserving only brief attention,” and stating that the issue had already been resolved in other cases, “plain and simple.” Wow, smackdown. In short, something was amiss here in the appellate decision, and the judiciary crossed a political line.  When this type of misstep happens, it is usually not the case that the judges have bent the law to their political tastes, but rather that judges simply are human.  They make mistakes and, yes, their political worldview does inform their judicial philosophy.  That said, there is good reason to wonder whether some sort of political quid-pro-quo was going on here behind the scenes.  I should note that all three judges on the Appellate Court appear to have connections to the Democratic party, and the justice writing the decision, Justice Hoffman had been chastised in the past by the Chicago Council of Lawyers for letting his political leanings stain his judicial reputation (in campaign material that criticized a LaRouche supporter).  Could it be that the court stepped over its bounds in this case at someone else’s behest?  Who stood to gain from this anyway? Joe Berrios When asked who was funding the litigation against Emanuel, the attorney for the plaintiffs, Burt Odelson, merely responded that it is “none of your business.”  Odelson is in fact well-known for representing Republican candidates, and he was involved in the Florida recount litigation in the run-up to Bush v. Gore.  But even more interesting than Odelson, is that one of the attorneys assisting him in the case was Tom Jaconetty, a top aide to recently elected Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios.  During that election, Emanuel suppoted Berrios’ opponent, Forrest Claypool.  When asked who was paying his fee, Jaconetty likewise deflected that “We haven’t really discussed it.”  Riiight. Could this be a part of a well-orchestrated political attack from the Blagojevich-wing of the Democratic party?   Welcome to Chicago politics, ladies and gentlemen, and we are just getting started. While Odelson and Jaconetty were the attorneys running the case, the petition was brought by two Cook County citizens, Walter P. Maksym and Thomas L. McMahon.  The New York Times describes McMahon as a retired police officer, though he was not just an officer, but a police captain.   And who do you think the police union supported for Cook County assessor?  You guessed it, Joe Berrios.  Even more interesting is that the other plaintiff, Walter Maksym, is another lawyer with a long history in Cook County. Maksym represented the controversial founder of the cult-like self-help program est, Werner Erhard, in the litigation that ensued after 60 Minutes aired an expose on Erhard in 1991, which included allegations of spousal abuse and incest-rape of his daughter.  Maksym also represented Landmark Education, which purchased the est program from Erhard under the label “The Forum,” in litigation against the Cult Awareness Network in 1994.  This included multiple attempts to compel legal journalist Steven Pressman to reveal the sources of his book Outrageous Betrayal. In 2006, Maksym produced a promotional film on Erhard and his teachings, and he runs a publishing business under the aliases Walter Maksym Publishing and Breakthru Publishing, whose titles include “Diets Don’t Work” and “One Hour Orgasm.”  It is hard to pin down what Maksym’s political agenda might be, but he appears to be into new-age power politics.  And with his extensive litigation history, one might wonder why Maksym filed as plaintiff in this suit, when he likely acted as a third attorney on the case. Clearly there are a lot of interests at stake in an election litigation like this, and certainly some well-funded politicians would only be too happy to achieve through the courts what they can’t achieve at the polls.  Let’s just hope our judiciary continues to live up to the standard upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court. (2) Readers Comments Howard Schumann January 31, 2011 at 4:08 am Your heading says “no bull”, yet you repeat the blatant falsehood that the Est Training developed by Werner Erhard was “cult-like”. This two weekend training was complete in itself. No one “joined” Est. You signed up for it like you would enroll in any course. It had absolutley no attributes of a cult, a lie spread by the right-wing Christian anti-cult crusaders. This training contributed to the health and well being of thousands and thousands of people including myself and my family. The greatest testament to Werner’s programs is that, in spite of media untruths spread by Scientology and the ill-informed, are still making a difference in people’s lives, 36 years after they were first begun.

Well, he was born in Chicago, grew up in Chicago, was educated in Chicago and represented Chicago in Congress for three terms. Yet he’s not ‘Chicago’ enough to run for Mayor? The Illinois courts seem to think so. Because Emanuel did not physically reside in Chicago for the last 12 months, they disqualified him from this year’s mayoral race. This absurd story runs parallel to many Third Culture Kid tales we hear on Denizen. My story is not unique: raised with American friends, educated in American schools, attended American university, yet cannot live or work in America without struggle because I was born on foreign soil. Trying to put hard and fast rules to the terms “residency” or “citizenship” hurts everyone. Chicagoans lose the chance to vote for the frontrunner — Emanuel had 44 percent support according to polls, and $12 million in the bank. The American workforce loses talented, international, college-educated Third Culture Kids who are not given a fair chance at success. These TCKs who look, sound, and are American, face complicated immigration issues because of laws that were made to keep aliens away. According to the Chicago residency rule, a person who has lived in New York until their 40th birthday could have rented an apartment in Chicago last year and run for mayor this year. And yet Emanuel cannot? Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn writes that these residency restrictions came about in the 19th century when high mobility and settlement caused fears about ‘outsiders’ coming in and manipulating local politics. According to American immigration laws, a person who was born in America but has spent their entire lives in Hong Kong is allowed to live and work in the U.S. whenever they please. Meanwhile, a person who was raised in American communities their whole life has to fight to stay? The Chicago Tribune calls the ruling “an ‘absurd result‘ — a preposterous outcome unenvisioned and unintended by the crafters of the law.” But many laws surrounding immigration, residency and citizenship are absurd. As Third Culture Kids, we’re used to it. To circumvent the ridiculous laws, Emanuel’s lawyers are now toying with the concept of “intent.” Did the former White House Chief of Staff really mean to come back to Chicago? Did him paying taxes in Chicago, owning property in Chicago, and leaving his wife’s wedding dress in Chicago make him a resident? While they do this digging, let’s not forget that this born-and-bred Chicagoan was elected to Congress by the people of Chicago. “Can a person dwell conceptually, or do they have to have a place to put their body?” Illinois Justice Thomas Hoffman asked in Emanuel’s case. Watching Emanuel’s legal battle hits close to home, because as a Third Culture Kid, we deal with this every day, and we know how absurd these laws really are.

Blog Community Advertise Masthead Contact Us Subscribe Search Rahm’s Dharma Drama by Adam [➚] · Saturday, January 29th, 2011 The ongoing saga of Rahm Emanuel’s mayoral aspirations have seen a lot of back and forth.  First, Rahm’s residency during his work in the White House was challenged in the Cook County Electoral Commission.  He got by that.  This last week, an Appellete Court ruled  Emanuel ineligible on those same residency issues.  Immediately following, his campaign sought and won a ‘stay’ order by the Supreme Court so that ballots for the upcoming election would not be printed without his name.  The Supreme Court of Illinois announced it would hear the case and handed down a ruling the Emanuel is eligible to run and is to be included on the ballots. Polls put Rahm as the front runner, and the candidate enjoys solid support from the city’s Jewish community, Obama’s team and his old boss Bill Clinton.  Though many disparagingly view him as the anointed successor to Mayor Daley or the practitioner of a particular brand of hardball politics, it seems to me he’s likely the right guy for the job. It is his destiny. His dharma. Meet the new Boss… Chicago’s first Jewish mayor.

This is based on…what, exactly? (Not a Chicago voter, but generally skeptical of anything that then declares that the mayorship is someone’s “destiny.”) miri · January 29th, 2011 at 8:18 pm Miri, don’t think so much. Everyone running for Mayor of Chicago with a hope of winning is a long time, party-boss approved crook. Might as well be a Jew. Victor · January 29th, 2011 at 11:54 pm it seems to me he’s likely the right guy for the job. as a born and raised Chicagoan with family roots there since the 1890s, I can tell you that he is the right guy for the job because he is a certified asshole, a loudmouth, a liar and corrupt to the core. just what it takes to serve as Chicago’s mayor. Justin · January 30th, 2011 at 1:31 am It seems to me he’s likely the right guy for the job,as a born and raised Chicagoan. I think he’s the only one with enough clout and the right atitude to control the city council. He know how to bust balls and isn’t afraid to do what he has to get things done. And frankly I’d rather have him then council wars. Rebecca Tolman · January 30th, 2011 at 11:16 am he is a certified asshole, a loudmouth, a liar and corrupt to the core. No doubt he is an asshole and a loudmouth. I don’t know too much about him, but do we know that he’s a corrupt liar as well? David A.M. Wilensky · January 30th, 2011 at 2:16 pm @victor – May as well. I sat next to him on Yom Kippur two years ago. Does that make him a good guy? No, but it says something… @miri – Its his destiny in that he’s progressively positioned himself in positions that would accumulate that clout. When two US Presidents endorse you and your White House replacement is the brother of the current mayor, it might be fait accompli. It likely was decided before Daley even announced retiring. @justin – he’s the right guy in that he has the political clout and civic alliances to ensure that the city runs smoothly and doesn’t have racially driven ‘council wars.’ @david – I have no evidence that Rahm is or isn’t corrupt, and like most Chicagoans, I don’t mind if you are. Sadly, it takes a little corruption to get things done, keep the city safe and improve the schools. Its a dirty business. @Rebeeca – Spot on. adam · January 30th, 2011 at 3:27 pm but do we know that he’s a corrupt liar as well he’s a high level american politican. Justin · January 30th, 2011 at 5:51 pm I’m a suburbanite, so I’m affected by what the Chicago voters do, but get no voice or vote. The Chicago voters will choose their next mayor, according to whom they consider best capable of making the City that Works keep on Working. My sense is that Rahm’s being Jewish will not be nearly as much a factor as his not being African-American or Hispanic. He has a reputation for being somewhat foul-mouthed. However, some of the previous commenters on this post out-do him. Noodnik · January 30th, 2011 at 6:29 pm May as well. I sat next to him on Yom Kippur two years ago. Does that make him a good guy? No, but it says something… Head…exploding… miri · January 30th, 2011 at 10:51 pm I know, I know. Just try not to think about it Chicago is one of the last real bastions of machine party politics. What the left says Israel is to progressive Jews, Chicago is to the progressive left. The system is so vast, so powerful, it completes a triple-homicide on idealism before breakfast. I’m in Wisconsin. I graduated with guys who are now Wisconsin State Senators, Aldermen, Milwaukee County Board members, and one who moved down to Chicago and got involved in City Hall there. Every time we get together, and I hear about how double-dealing Milwaukee politics is or how cynically corrupt Madison is, the Chicago guy starts talking and we all just sit in silence for a while, recovering from the trauma. Victor · January 30th, 2011 at 11:08 pm @miri to be clear, its that he knows he things to atone for, even if he doesnt’ actually do it adam · January 31st, 2011 at 12:07 am I’m in Wisconsin I’m so sorry. Justin · January 31st, 2011 at 2:30 am And that’s coming from someone in Chicago! CHICAGO!!! My friend, I feel sorry for YOU! Illinois just raised its income taxes by what, 66% in one year! Your sales tax is about to increase as well, already the country’s highest, I believe. You are more than welcome to take Wisconsin’s place as the Midwest’s worst to do business in tax hell. And we’ll be happy to pick off your corporate refugees. After Gov. Doyle’s crony fiscal terrorism, on top of his actual cronyism, we need some sanity in Wisconsin. We had a conservative tidal wave in the fall – the Governorship, both Houses of state legislature, two or three congressional seats and one senate seat flipped to republicans. The Dems had their chance, and they failed, miserably, despicably. We’re hemorrhaging jobs up here. Victor · January 31st, 2011 at 11:46 am From Chicago, not in. This allows me to retain the right to relentlessly make fun of Wisconsin without having to deal with the insanity that is Chicagoland. Wisconsin politicking aside, it’s just a silly place. truly. Justin · January 31st, 2011 at 12:29 pm Yeah, I mean, pickles in beer? Come on… adam · January 31st, 2011 at 2:06 pm eww… fine, guilty.

The state's highest court agreed Tuesday to decide whether Emanuel can run for mayor, and the justices ordered election officials not to print any ballots without his name until they can rule. The action bought valuable time for the former White House chief of staff, who a day earlier was kicked off the ballot by an appeals court because he didn't live in the city for a year before the Feb. 22 election. The state Supreme Court said it would expedite the matter but gave no specific time frame. With less than a week to go before the first early ballots are cast, a number of potential scenarios loomed, including the possibility that Emanuel would have to resort to a write–in campaign or wage a desperate bid to take the matter to federal court. Emanuel, who had been the heavy favorite to lead the nation's third–largest city, pressed ahead with confidence and said he was doubling his campaign by adding more stops to his already busy schedule. "I am clear that I think that we will succeed because of the thoroughness of our argument," he said Tuesday at an event where he received an endorsement from the Teamsters. He said he was "more determined to see this through so the people have a right to make the choice for themselves." Until October, the former Chicago congressman had been living in Washington working for President Barack Obama. The high court was to review legal briefs and would not hold oral arguments, a sign the justices want to decide the case quickly. That plan is "absolutely a reflection that they understand the tightness of the time schedule," said Dawn Clark Netsch, a professor emeritus at Northwestern University's law school. Chicago election officials said they had printed nearly 300,000 ballots without Emanuel's name before they abruptly stopped. The Board of Elections had hurriedly authorized the printing after Monday's appellate ruling. "Things are changing in an unprecedented fashion," board chairman Langdon Neal said. If the Supreme Court does not put Emanuel back on the ballot, he could consider a write–in campaign. He would have to declare himself a write–in candidate by Feb. 15. Emanuel has declined to say whether he would entertain such a drastic step. He also has refused to say whether he would consider other legal remedies, such as finding a way to get his case into the federal courts, possibly all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But Netsch said there was little chance the matter could make the leap to federal court. "In my judgment there is no significant federal constitutional issue," she said. In their appeal to the high court, Emanuel's attorneys called Monday's ruling "one of the most far–reaching election law rulings" ever issued in Illinois, not only because of its effect on the mayoral race but for "the unprecedented restriction" it puts on future candidates. His lawyers raised several points, including that the appeals court applied a stricter definition of "residency" than the one used for voters. They say Illinois courts have never required candidates to be physically present in the state to seek office there. By adopting this new requirement, the court rejected state law allowing people to keep their residence in Illinois even if they are away doing work for the state or federal government, the appeal said. The new standard also sets a "significant limitation on ballot access" that denies voters the right to choose certain candidates, the appeal said. John Coli, president of the Teamsters Joint Council 25 that endorsed Emanuel, said the two appellate judges who threw Emanuel off the ballot were "subverting democracy." He called the opinion "ridiculous." "I believe that the law's on Rahm's side in this case," said Coli, who is also an attorney. In a dissent filed Monday, appellate court Judge Bertina Lampkin pointed out that Emanuel never voted in Washington, didn't change his driver's license, didn't buy property and didn't do his personal banking in Washington. "How many days may a person stay away from his home before the majority would decide he no longer 'actually resides' in it? Would the majority have us pick a number out of a hat?" she wrote. In the wake of Monday's ruling, other main candidates in the race — former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, city Clerk Miguel del Valle and former Chicago schools chief Gery Chico — moved quickly to try to win over Emanuel supporters. ___ Associated Press (News - Alert) writer Sophia Tareen contributed to this report. ___ Online: Illinois election law: http://tinyurl.com/5uuat7y Related Images: Close View All Associated Press Articles Latest News Panasonic: La Clase a Distancia para Fabricar una Bateria se Llevo a Cabo entre Japon y Nepal por Primera Vez 21st Century Fox llega a un acuerdo para combinar sus participaciones europeas de television por satelite; el nuevo Sky se convertira en el negocio de television de pago lider de Europa Justice Department Announces Proposed Amendment to Americans with Disabilities Act Regulations to Expand Access to Movie Theaters for Individuals with Hearing and Vision Disabilities Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC Announces Expanded Investigation of Ocean Power Technologies, Inc.
