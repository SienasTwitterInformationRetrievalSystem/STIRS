The portrait was taken at the rock target "John Klein," where the rover collected the first ever bedrock sample of Mars using its drill on Feb. 8. Credit: ASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS View full size image NASA's Curiosity rover has powered down to wait out a Mars-bound solar blast, complicating efforts to bring the 1-ton robot back from a computer glitch. Curiosity's handlers put the rover on standby after the sun unleashed a medium-strength flare in the Red Planet's direction Tuesday (March 5). It's the second recent shutdown for Curiosity, which had just come out of protective "safe mode" Saturday (March 2) as engineers work through an issue with its primary computer system. "Storm's a-comin'! There's a solar storm heading for Mars. I'm going back to sleep to weather it out," NASA officials wrote on behalf of the rover via Curiosity's Twitter feed today (March 6). The rover team views the shutdown as merely a precaution, as Curiosity was designed to withstand such solar outbursts, the Associated Press reported. But the move could delay the rover's return to science operations, which had been anticipated as early as this weekend. Curiosity landed inside Mars' huge Gale Crater last August to determine if the area has ever been capable of supporting microbial life. The robot had been operating pretty much flawlessly on the Red Planet until last Wednesday (Feb. 27), when it failed to send recorded data home to Earth and didn't shift into its daily sleep mode as planned. [Curiosity Rover's Latest Amazing Mars Photos] The mission team determined that a glitch had affected the flash memory on Curiosity's main, or A-side, computer system. So engineers swapped the rover over to its backup (B-side) computer, which spurred Curiosity to go into safe mode on Thursday (Feb. 28). Since then, the robot's handlers have been working to configure the B-side computer for surface operations and fix the problem with the A-side, which they think may have been caused by a fast-moving charged particle known as a cosmic ray. Curiosity has been on the road to recovery. The rover came out of safe mode on Saturday and began using its high-gain antenna again a day later. Mission officials have expressed confidence that engineers will fix or troubleshoot the glitch soon, saying Curiosity may resume science operations as early as this weekend if all continues to go well. The solar flare may now push that timeline back a bit, however. A 'Curiosity' Quiz: How Well Do You Know NASA's New...

Tuesday's flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection (CME), which blasted a huge cloud of solar plasma toward the Red Planet. CMEs that slam into Earth inject large amounts of energy into our planet's magnetic field, spawning potentially devastating geomagnetic storms that can disrupt GPS signals, radio communications and power grids for days. But CMEs don't have a similar impact on Mars, which lacks a global magnetic field, scientists say. Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook or Google+.

Credit: ESA&NASA/SOHO On Feb. 9, 2013 at 2:30 a.m. EST, the sun erupted with an Earth-directed coronal mass ejection or CME, associated with a long duration C2.4-class flare. Experimental NASA research models, based on observations from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) and ESA/NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, show that the CME left the sun at speeds of around 500 miles per second, which is a fairly typical speed for CMEs. Historically, CMEs at this speed are usually benign. Not to be confused with a solar flare, a CME is a solar phenomenon that can send solar particles into space and reach Earth one to three days later. Earth-directed CMEs can cause a space weather phenomenon called a geomagnetic storm, which occurs when they connect with the outside of the Earth's magnetic envelope, the magnetosphere, for an extended period of time. In the past, CMEs at this strength have had little effect. They may cause auroras near the poles but are unlikely to disrupt electrical systems on Earth or interfere with GPS or satellite-based communications systems.

Updates will be provided if needed. What is a CME? For answers to this and other space weather questions, please visit the Spaceweather Frequently Asked Questions page.

Rosen Feb 6 2013, 4:39 PM ET Tweet More Email Print Get ready: It's loud. A much, much bigger solar flare than the one Thomas Ashcraft captured (NASA) Amateur radio astronomer Thomas Ashcraft doesn't like to just look at space: He also listens to it. Last weekend, he picked up the radio emissions resulting from a relatively small (C 2.9) solar flare, and shared the recording with Discover Magazine. Over email, Aschcraft described to Discover's Breanna Draxler how he got the recording: DISCOVER: What exactly are we hearing on this recording? Ashcraft: We are hearing a solar Type III radio burst that was generated by a solar flare as recorded at 28 MHz and 21 MHz. Although the flare was relatively small, this particular radio burst was quite strong. Type III solar radio emissions are produced by electrons accelerated to high energies by solar flares. As the electrons stream outward from the sun, they excite plasma oscillations in the sun's atmosphere. The plasma oscillations in turn generate radio emissions that sweep out into space. On one stereo channel there was a voice transmission in progress, likely a ham radio operator, and as the solar radio wave passed through the voice gets thoroughly overpowered and then returns as the blast passes through. Type III solar bursts are also called "fast drift bursts" because they drift down in frequency. It is a little hard to hear in this recording but the burst actually hits one channel at 28 MHz first and then can be heard at 21 MHz a second later on the other stereo channel. Listen close to hear this. What kind of equipment do you use to record the activity of a solar flare? I have a complex array of instruments and observe at multiple frequencies. This particular solar burst was recorded using two simple shortwave radios connected to a three element yagi antenna. The Sun radiates across the full spectrum but, serendipitously, it can be very strong and hot at common shortwave radio frequencies. I audio record into a digital recorder. Other recently recorded space sounds include a dying star and the magnetosphere around Earth. Because you can explore space with your ears as well as your eyes -- not to mention your nose.

Get Science Newsletters: Subscribe Follow:  NASA, Cme, Coronal Mass Ejection, Esa, Solar Flare, Solar System, Space, Sun, Sun Eruption, Science News By: Tariq Malik Published: 02/10/2013 02:40 AM EST on SPACE.com A long-lasting solar flare erupted from the sun early Saturday (Feb. 9), triggering an intense sun eruption aimed squarely at Earth. The solar storm, however, should not endanger satellites or astronauts in space, but could amplify auroras on Earth, NASA says. The solar eruption —called a coronal mass ejection —occurred at 2:30 a.m. EST (0730 GMT) on Saturday during a minor, but long-duration, flare. It hurled a wave of charged particles at Earth at speeds of about 1.8 million miles per hour (nearly 2.9 million km/h). The sun eruption was captured in photos by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), a joint mission by NASA and the European Space Agency. Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are eruptions of charged solar material that fling solar particles out into space. When aimed at Earth, they can reach the planet between one and three days later, and cause geomagnetic storms when they interact with the planet's magnetic field. They can also amplify the northern and southern lights displays over the Earth's poles. "In the past, CMEs at this strength have had little effect," NASA officials said in a statement. "They may cause auroras near the poles but are unlikely to disrupt electrical systems on Earth or interfere with GPS or satellite-based communications systems." Saturday's solar flare and sun eruption apparently also caught the attention astronauts living on the International Space Station, even though the solar weather event will have little impact on their daily routine. "We live right next to a star," wrote Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who currently lives on the International Space Station, in a Twitter post. "Today it ejected a huge blob at 500 mi/sec. But not to worry - should be good aurorae." The sun is currently in an active period of its 11-year solar weather cycle, and is expected to reach its peak this year. The sun's current weather cycle is known as Solar Cycle 24. The SOHO spacecraft and several other sun-watching observatories, such as NASA's twin Stereo spacecraft and the Solar Dynamics Observatory, constantly monitor the star for changes in solar weather.

REALITY: Solar flares can release electromagnetic radiation that's strong enough to disrupt electric power grids, satellites, GPS, and radio communications. Pictured: Coronal mass ejection as viewed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory on June 7, 2011. MYTH: A solar flare could kill us all. REALITY: Only a tiny fraction of the energy liberated by a solar flare reaches the Earth, because we're protected by our planet's atmosphere. "We have a very long record that shows that even the strongest flares can't blow out the atmosphere," Antti Pulkkinen, a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, told CNN. Pictured: A solar eruptive prominence as seen in extreme UV light on March 30, 2010 with Earth superimposed for a sense of scale. MYTH: Solar flares occur at random. REALITY: Solar flares follow an 11-year cycle. Pictured: Full-disk images of the sun's lower corona during solar cycle 23, as it progressed from solar minimum to maximum conditions and back to minimum (upper right). MYTH: 'Aftershocks' are rare. REALITY: About one in seven flares is followed by an aftershock -- the flare springs back to life, producing an extra surge of ultraviolet radiation. Pictured: Sunspot 1112, crackling with solar flares, spotted by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory on October 16, 2010. MYTH: Solar flares can be seen with the naked eye. REALITY: To see a solar flare from Earth, you must use a solar telescope. Never stare directly at the sun. What you can see with a naked eye are northern lights, which can be triggered by solar eruptions. Pictured: Northern lights (aurora borealis) over Lake Elora in Minnesota on July 15, 2012. MYTH: Solar flares were discovered only recently. REALITY: Solar flares were first observed in 1859 by English astronomer Richard Carrington. Pictured: Sunspots of September 1, 1859 as sketched by Richard Carrington. MYTH: Solar flares are small compared to other explosions in our solar system. REALITY: Solar flares are among the biggest explosions in our solar system. "They erupt near sunspots with the force of a hundred million hydrogen bombs," Robert Lin of UC Berkeley's Space Science Lab said in <a href="http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/energy/Resources/Living%20With%20a%20Star/------START%20HERE-------/6/solar_f.htm#top">a written statement</a>. Pictured: Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft image of a solar flare on October 28, 2003. MYTH: Solar flares can knock satellites from orbit. REALITY: When satellites do fall out of orbit, it's because Earth's gravity is pulling them down. Pictured: Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) image of an M7.9 class solar flare on March 13, 2012. MYTH: Solar flares produce sunspots. REALITY: It's actually the other way around. Magnetic fields associated with sunspots -- cool, dark regions of the sun's surface -- can sometimes give rise to solar flares. Pictured: NASA's sun-observing TRACE spacecraft image shows a large sunspot group from September 2000. MYTH: Solar flares and solar prominences are different names for the same phenomenon. REALITY: Solar flares and prominences are different. A prominence is a loop of plasma traveling along magnetic field lines. Sometimes this loop collapses back into the sun -- or, if the prominence erupts, a solar flare can result. Pictured: A solar prominence on October 19, 2012, captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). MYTH: Solar flares and coronal mass ejections are the same thing. REALITY: Coronal mass ejections are also explosions on the sun--but a different type of explosion. "If a solar flare is a tornado, very intense, very focused, very local, a coronal mass ejection is a hurricane," astronomer Phil Plait told The Huffington Post. Pictured: An X1.4 solar flare associated with a coronal mass ejection on July 12, 2012.

An Earth-Directed coronal mass ejection (CME) occurred during the early morning hours Friday. The resulting solar flare was pointed directly at the United States for a duration of nearly two hours, according to Hunter Outten. Outten is a contributing forecaster for the AccuWeather Astronomy page. "The CME is pretty strong and is coming pretty quick," said Outten. An intense Northern Lights show will cover a large part of the northern U.S. "The lights could be visible for the states of Maryland, Pennsylvania and everywhere northward," said Outten. "The best time to look for them will be around midnight," said Outten. "The states in the northernmost U.S. may be able to see them all night long." RELATED: Could a Solar Flare Destroy the Earth? What Exactly Is a X-Class Solar Flare? Northeast Doppler Radar Viewing Conditions Saturday The best viewing conditions will be in the eastern New England, where skies will be clear. Skies will partially clear around New York City and Pennsylvania, away from Lake Erie. Partly cloudy conditions for the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and western New York will limit the chance to view the lights. Viewing Conditions Sunday Again on Sunday night, the New England states will have the best chance to view the lights. Skies will be clear across this region, as well as across upstate New York. Cloudy skies will dominate the mid-Atlantic and Midwest with skies set to partially clear across the northern High Plains. There will also be partly cloudy skies over Idaho, central to eastern Oregon and the extreme eastern parts of Washington state on Sunday. According to NOAA, the geomagnetic storm that will produce the northern lights will arrive late on Saturday and be a minor storm. The geomagnetic storm on Sunday is rated as moderate. The more intense the storm is, the better chance it will be for the Northern Lights to appear. "This geomagnetic storm may disrupt communications, such as satellite television and G.P.S. units," said Outten.
