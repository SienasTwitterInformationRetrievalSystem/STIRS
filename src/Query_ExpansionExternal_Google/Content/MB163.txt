PDF      Print Guidance FIN-2013-G001 Issued: March 18, 2013 Subject: Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies             The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN") is issuing this interpretive guidance to clarify the applicability of the regulations implementing the Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") to persons creating, obtaining, distributing, exchanging, accepting, or transmitting virtual currencies.1 Such persons are referred to in this guidance as "users," "administrators," and "exchangers," all as defined below.2 A user of virtual currency is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations and therefore is not subject to MSB registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations. However, an administrator or exchanger is an MSB under FinCEN's regulations, specifically, a money transmitter, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person. An administrator or exchanger is not a provider or seller of prepaid access, or a dealer in foreign exchange, under FinCEN's regulations. Currency vs. Virtual Currency             FinCEN's regulations define currency (also referred to as "real" currency) as "the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that [i] is designated as legal tender and that [ii] circulates and [iii] is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance."3 In contrast to real currency, "virtual" currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency. In particular, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. This guidance addresses "convertible" virtual currency. This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency. Background             On July 21, 2011, FinCEN published a Final Rule amending definitions and other regulations relating to money services businesses ("MSBs").4 Among other things, the MSB Rule amends the definitions of dealers in foreign exchange (formerly referred to as "currency dealers and exchangers") and money transmitters. On July 29, 2011, FinCEN published a Final Rule on Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Prepaid Access (the "Prepaid Access Rule").5 This guidance explains the regulatory treatment under these definitions of persons engaged in virtual currency transactions. Definitions of User, Exchanger, and Administrator             This guidance refers to the participants in generic virtual currency arrangements, using the terms "user," "exchanger," and "administrator."6 A user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services.7 An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. An administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency. Users of Virtual Currency             A user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations.8 Such activity, in and of itself, does not fit within the definition of "money transmission services" and therefore is not subject to FinCEN's registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations for MSBs.9 Administrators and Exchangers of Virtual Currency             An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person.10 FinCEN's regulations define the term "money transmitter" as a person that provides money transmission services, or any other person engaged in the transfer of funds. The term "money transmission services" means "the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means."11             The definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies. Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA.12 FinCEN has reviewed different activities involving virtual currency and has made determinations regarding the appropriate regulatory treatment of administrators and exchangers under three scenarios: brokers and dealers of e-currencies and e-precious metals; centralized convertible virtual currencies; and de-centralized convertible virtual currencies.             a. E-Currencies and E-Precious Metals             The first type of activity involves electronic trading in e-currencies or e-precious metals.13 In 2008, FinCEN issued guidance stating that as long as a broker or dealer in real currency or other commodities accepts and transmits funds solely for the purpose of effecting a bona fide purchase or sale of the real currency or other commodities for or with a customer, such person is not acting as a money transmitter under the regulations.14             However, if the broker or dealer transfers funds between a customer and a third party that is not part of the currency or commodity transaction, such transmission of funds is no longer a fundamental element of the actual transaction necessary to execute the contract for the purchase or sale of the currency or the other commodity. This scenario is, therefore, money transmission.15 Examples include, in part, (1) the transfer of funds between a customer and a third party by permitting a third party to fund a customer's account; (2) the transfer of value from a customer's currency or commodity position to the account of another customer; or (3) the closing out of a customer's currency or commodity position, with a transfer of proceeds to a third party. Since the definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies, the same rules apply to brokers and dealers of e-currency and e-precious metals.             b. Centralized Virtual Currencies             The second type of activity involves a convertible virtual currency that has a centralized repository. The administrator of that repository will be a money transmitter to the extent that it allows transfers of value between persons or from one location to another. This conclusion applies, whether the value is denominated in a real currency or a convertible virtual currency. In addition, any exchanger that uses its access to the convertible virtual currency services provided by the administrator to accept and transmit the convertible virtual currency on behalf of others, including transfers intended to pay a third party for virtual goods and services, is also a money transmitter.             FinCEN understands that the exchanger's activities may take one of two forms. The first form involves an exchanger (acting as a "seller" of the convertible virtual currency) that accepts real currency or its equivalent from a user (the "purchaser") and transmits the value of that real currency to fund the user's convertible virtual currency account with the administrator. Under FinCEN's regulations, sending "value that substitutes for currency" to another person or to another location constitutes money transmission, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies.16 This circumstance constitutes transmission to another location, namely from the user's account at one location (e.g., a user's real currency account at a bank) to the user's convertible virtual currency account with the administrator. It might be argued that the exchanger is entitled to the exemption from the definition of "money transmitter" for persons involved in the sale of goods or the provision of services. Under such an argument, one might assert that the exchanger is merely providing the service of connecting the user to the administrator and that the transmission of value is integral to this service. However, this exemption does not apply when the only services being provided are money transmission services.17             The second form involves a de facto sale of convertible virtual currency that is not completely transparent. The exchanger accepts currency or its equivalent from a user and privately credits the user with an appropriate portion of the exchanger's own convertible virtual currency held with the administrator of the repository. The exchanger then transmits that internally credited value to third parties at the user's direction. This constitutes transmission to another person, namely each third party to which transmissions are made at the user's direction. To the extent that the convertible virtual currency is generally understood as a substitute for real currencies, transmitting the convertible virtual currency at the direction and for the benefit of the user constitutes money transmission on the part of the exchanger.             c. De-Centralized Virtual Currencies             A final type of convertible virtual currency activity involves a de-centralized convertible virtual currency (1) that has no central repository and no single administrator, and (2) that persons may obtain by their own computing or manufacturing effort.             A person that creates units of this convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods and services is a user of the convertible virtual currency and not subject to regulation as a money transmitter. By contrast, a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter. In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency. Providers and Sellers of Prepaid Access             A person's acceptance and/or transmission of convertible virtual currency cannot be characterized as providing or selling prepaid access because prepaid access is limited to real currencies. 18 Dealers in Foreign Exchange             A person must exchange the currency of two or more countries to be considered a dealer in foreign exchange.19 Virtual currency does not meet the criteria to be considered "currency" under the BSA, because it is not legal tender. Therefore, a person who accepts real currency in exchange for virtual currency, or vice versa, is not a dealer in foreign exchange under FinCEN's regulations. * * * * *             Financial institutions with questions about this guidance or other matters related to compliance with the implementing regulations of the BSA may contact FinCEN's Regulatory Helpline at (800) 949-2732. 1 FinCEN is issuing this guidance under its authority to administer the Bank Secrecy Act. See Treasury Order 180-01 (March 24, 2003). This guidance explains only how FinCEN characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies under the Bank Secrecy Act and FinCEN regulations. It should not be interpreted as a statement by FinCEN about the extent to which those activities comport with other federal or state statutes, rules, regulations, or orders. 2 FinCEN's regulations define "person" as "an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a trust or estate, a joint stock company, an association, a syndicate, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization or group, an Indian Tribe (as that term is defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act), and all entities cognizable as legal personalities." 31 CFR � 1010.100(mm). 3 31 CFR � 1010.100(m). 4 Bank Secrecy Act Regulations - Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Money Services Businesses, 76 FR 43585 (July 21, 2011) (the "MSB Rule"). This defines an MSB as "a person wherever located doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized or licensed business concern, wholly or in substantial part within the United States, in one or more of the capacities listed in paragraphs (ff)(1) through (ff)(7) of this section. This includes but is not limited to maintenance of any agent, agency, branch, or office within the United States." 31 CFR � 1010.100(ff). 5 Final Rule - Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Prepaid Access, 76 FR 45403 (July 29, 2011), 6 These terms are used for the exclusive purpose of this regulatory guidance. Depending on the type and combination of a person's activities, one person may be acting in more than one of these capacities. 7 How a person engages in "obtaining" a virtual currency may be described using any number of other terms, such as "earning," "harvesting," "mining," "creating," "auto-generating," "manufacturing," or "purchasing," depending on the details of the specific virtual currency model involved. For purposes of this guidance, the label applied to a particular process of obtaining a virtual currency is not material to the legal characterization under the BSA of the process or of the person engaging in the process. 8 As noted above, this should not be interpreted as a statement about the extent to which the user's activities comport with other federal or state statutes, rules, regulations, or orders. For example, the activity may still be subject to abuse in the form of trade-based money laundering or terrorist financing. The activity may follow the same patterns of behavior observed in the "real" economy with respect to the purchase of "real" goods and services, such as systematic over- or under-invoicing or inflated transaction fees or commissions. 9 31 CFR � 1010.100(ff)(1-7). 10 FinCEN's regulations provide that whether a person is a money transmitter is a matter of facts and circumstances. The regulations identify six circumstances under which a person is not a money transmitter, despite accepting and transmitting currency, funds, or value that substitutes for currency. 31 CFR � 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(A)-(F). 11 31 CFR � 1010.100(ff)(5)(i)(A). 12 Ibid. 13 Typically, this involves the broker or dealer electronically distributing digital certificates of ownership of real currencies or precious metals, with the digital certificate being the virtual currency. However, the same conclusions would apply in the case of the broker or dealer issuing paper ownership certificates or manifesting customer ownership or control of real currencies or commodities in an account statement or any other form. These conclusions would also apply in the case of a broker or dealer in commodities other than real currencies or precious metals. A broker or dealer of e-currencies or e-precious metals that engages in money transmission could be either an administrator or exchanger depending on its business model. 14 Application of the Definition of Money Transmitter to Brokers and Dealers in Currency and other Commodities, FIN-2008-G008, Sept. 10, 2008. The guidance also notes that the definition of money transmitter excludes any person, such as a futures commission merchant, that is "registered with, and regulated or examined by�the Commodity Futures Trading Commission." 15 In 2011, FinCEN amended the definition of money transmitter. The 2008 guidance, however, was primarily concerned with the core elements of the definition - accepting and transmitting currency or value - and the exemption for acceptance and transmission integral to another transaction not involving money transmission. The 2011 amendments have not materially changed these aspects of the definition. 16 See footnote 11 and adjacent text. 17 31 CFR � 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(F). 18 This is true even if the person holds the value accepted for a period of time before transmitting some or all of that value at the direction of the person from whom the value was originally accepted. FinCEN's regulations define "prepaid access" as "access to funds or the value of funds that have been paid in advance and can be retrieved or transferred at some point in the future through an electronic device or vehicle, such as a card, code, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, or personal identification number." 31 CFR � 1010.100(ww). Thus, "prepaid access" under FinCEN's regulations is limited to "access to funds or the value of funds." If FinCEN had intended prepaid access to cover funds denominated in a virtual currency or something else that substitutes for real currency, it would have used language in the definition of prepaid access like that in the definition of money transmission, which expressly includes the acceptance and transmission of "other value that substitutes for currency." 31 CFR � 1010.100(ff)(5)(i) . 19 FinCEN defines a "dealer in foreign exchange" as a "person that accepts the currency, or other monetary instruments, funds, or other instruments denominated in the currency, of one or more countries in exchange for the currency, or other monetary instruments, funds, or other instruments denominated in the currency, of one or more other countries in an amount greater than $1,000 for any other person on any day in one or more transactions, whether or not for same-day delivery." 31 CFR � 1010.100(ff)(1). 12As our response is not in the form of an administrative ruling, the substance of this letter should not be considered determinative in any state or federal investigation, litigation, grand jury proceeding, or proceeding before any other governmental body.

Cutler News Updates Publications Join Our Mailing Lists Technology Transactions & Privacy Electronic Financial Services Interactive Entertainment E-Commerce Retail & Consumer Products Decentralized Virtual Currencies New FinCEN Guidance Changes Regulatory Landscape for Virtual Currencies and Some Prepaid Programs Update 03.22.2013 Overview To address a perceived gap in regulatory treatment of increasingly popular virtual currencies, including Bitcoin, the U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) released new guidance on March 18, 2013.  The guidance represents the first step toward formal regulation of decentralized currencies.  However, the guidance also extends beyond just decentralized currencies, impacting prepaid and virtual currency programs more broadly by introducing significant changes to the commonly understood application of FinCEN’s regulations to virtual currencies and prepaid programs.  Companies should carefully evaluate the regulatory and compliance impact of the new guidance on their virtual currency and prepaid programs, and seek clarification regarding fundamental questions raised, but not answered by, the guidance.  Background The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and corresponding regulations subject financial intuitions and Money Services Businesses (MSBs) to a wide range of anti-money laundering obligations. Among other things, MSBs must establish anti-money laundering programs, file currency transaction reports and suspicious activity reports, and collect and maintain customer information and transaction records.  Most types of MSBs must also register with FinCEN.  Regulated MSBs include, among other entities, providers of prepaid access and money transmitters.  The prepaid access rule governs “access to funds or the value of funds that have been paid in advance,” a definition broad enough that it appeared to govern many virtual currency programs.  However, the prepaid access rule is designed to govern only provider and sellers of prepaid access, and exempts certain forms of prepaid access from regulation.[1]  The recent rise in popularity of certain decentralized crypto-currencies, such as Bitcoin, appears to have caused federal concern that the prepaid access rule left federal authorities without enforcement power over users, administrators and exchangers of such currencies.[2]  If a virtual currency program is not regulated by the prepaid access rules (either because no entity could be said to act as a provider or seller of the program, or because the program qualified for the closed loop exemptions) that program is not subject to the anti-money laundering and customer information program requirements.  In an apparent attempt to address this gap, FinCEN released guidance regarding the “Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies” (Virtual Currency Guidance) on March 18, 2013.[3]  The Virtual Currency Guidance explains FinCEN’s interpretation of the MSB regulations as applied to virtual currencies and directs that “convertible virtual currencies” be subjected to the rules governing money transmission, while suggesting that prepaid products denominated in “real currency” be governed by the prepaid access rules. Scope of Virtual Currency Guidance Convertible Virtual Currency FinCEN limited the Virtual Currency Guidance to “convertible virtual currency.”[4]  FinCEN defines “virtual currency,” in contrast to “real currency,”[5] as “a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency.”[6]  In particular, FinCEN notes that virtual currency lacks the status of legal tender in any jurisdiction.[7]  “Convertible” virtual currency is further defined as either having “an equivalent value in real currency, or act[ing] as a substitute for real currency.”[8]  Ostensibly then, FinCEN envisions that some virtual currency might not exhibit either of these attributes and therefore fall outside the scope of the guidance.  Bitcoin clearly appears to be covered by the guidance.  The guidance is unclear, however, on what types of virtual currency would fall outside of the definition of “convertible.”  The resulting ambiguity leaves an open question as to whether the guidance creates a dichotomy between Internet-based prepaid access and traditional card-based prepaid access or a dichotomy between prepaid access denominated in legal tender and prepaid access that is not.  Open questions therefore remain as to whether programs involving "points," "miles" and similar units are regulated under the prepaid access rule or under the money transmitter regulations going forward. Administrators and ExchangersEven where a program involves convertible virtual currency, the guidance primarily applies to participants in the program that act as either administrators or exchangers.  An administrator “is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency.”[9]  An exchanger “is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency.”[10]  Importantly, a single entity might fulfill both the administrator and exchanger roles.[11]  Changes and Issues Raised by Virtual Currency GuidanceThe six pages of detailed FinCEN guidance contain interpretations of the MSB regulations that represent important shifts for the industry.  The following issues are among the most important raised by the Virtual Currency Guidance: Points, Credits, Miles and Other Virtual Currencies May Be Considered Centralized Virtual Currencies, Subject to Regulation:  The Virtual Currency Guidance splits virtual currencies into three categories: (1) e-currencies and e-precious metals; (2) centralized virtual currencies; and (3) decentralized virtual currencies.  FinCEN has taken prior enforcement action against e-currencies,[12] but the definitions of centralized and decentralized currencies offer some surprising implications.  For example, centralized virtual currencies are defined as a “convertible virtual currency that has a centralized repository.”[13]  To the extent that prepaid programs otherwise meet the definition of “convertible virtual currency,” such systems would be captured in the centralized virtual currency category—with the entity hosting and/or backing the prepaid program acting as the centralized repository.  This might be read to capture prepaid programs, such as credits, in-game points, airline miles and other programs previously considered prepaid access.     Money Transmitter Regulations Apply to Convertible Virtual Currencies:  According to the guidance, an administrator of a centralized virtual currency is a “money transmitter to the extent that it allows transfers of value between persons or from one location to another.”[14] Similarly, an exchanger of centralized virtual currency acts as a money transmitter when it accepts real currency in exchange for virtual currency and when it resells or anonymizes the sale of virtual currency by acting as an intermediary between the user and the administrator of the central repository.[15]  Furthermore, a person may be deemed an exchanger of decentralized currency if (a) the person mines the currency and then sells it rather than uses it to purchase goods and services, or (b) the person accepts the decentralized currency from one person and transmits it to another.[16] Loading Convertible Virtual Currency Accounts Is Money Transmission and the Goods and Services Exemption Does Not Apply: FinCEN’s guidance states that the mere act of selling or exchanging convertible virtual currency for real currency, or of loading a virtual wallet with convertible virtual currency in exchange for real currency, constitutes money transmission.  FinCEN claims that this activity is money transmission because even though the money is transferred to the same person, it involves real currency being transferred from one location to another (the person’s real bank account to the person’s virtual account).[17]  Importantly, FinCEN expressly states that the traditional exemption for money transmission as part of the provision of goods and services does not apply to the sale of virtual currency.[18] The Term “Users of Virtual Currencies” Is Limited to Use for Purchases: Although the guidance does not focus on users of virtual currencies, it is important to note that FinCEN limits the definition of a “user” to “a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services.”[19]  This raises the question of what actions might cause a person to cross over from an unregulated user to a regulated administrator or exchanger.  Sending virtual currency to another user?  A few sales of virtual currency?  Large volumes of virtual currency sales?  Use of virtual currency to purchase other currencies, whether real or virtual?  It is unclear whether FinCEN intended to import into the user requirements the concept contained within the definition of "exchanger" that one must be “engaged as a business” in order to be regulated.  This issue may be of particular importance to users of decentralized virtual currencies. Prepaid Access Must Be Denominated in Real Currency:  The Virtual Currency Guidance dismisses what has been common industry understanding of the MSB regulations—namely that the definition “funds or the value of funds paid in advance” can include virtual currencies.  Instead, the guidance limits prepaid access to “real currency.”[20]  FinCEN reaches this conclusion by noting the absence of the phrase “other value that substitutes for currency” from the prepaid access definition, as opposed to its specific inclusion in the money transmitter definition.[21]  This conclusion has several important ramifications.  For instance, when read together with FinCEN’s previously issued list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) regarding the prepaid access rules,[22] the guidance suggests that prepaid cards denominated in downloads or minutes no longer fall under the prepaid access rules. The Definition of “Exchanger” Covers Anyone Selling Convertible Virtual Currency: To the extent any entity is engaged as a business in selling or reselling convertible virtual currency, the guidance suggests it would be regulated as an MSB engaged in money transmission.    It Is Unclear Whether Wholesale Purchases of Virtual Currency Are Covered: The Virtual Currency Guidance does not address whether its analysis applies to business purchases of convertible virtual currency on a wholesale basis from an administrator or exchanger. The prepaid access rule similarly did not address wholesale transactions until FinCEN released answers to certain FAQs. Industry participants should seek clarification whether a similar wholesale exemption extends to the interpretation expounded in the Virtual Currency Guidance. Clear Need for Formal Rule-Making on Virtual Currency Issue:  For the purposes of this guidance, FinCEN created new terms and definitions for those terms, such as “user” in the context of virtual currency, “administrator,” “exchanger,” “convertible virtual currency” and “centralized repository.”  As is evident from the issues discussed above, the definitions of these terms and their appropriate application to existing prepaid programs is far from clear.  In fact, the definitions may create more questions than they answer.  For example, is a centralized repository the same as a centralized ledger?  When does a user “obtain” virtual currency as opposed to “creating” it?  Further, the guidance proposes new interpretations of existing regulations, the regulatory purpose of which remains murky.  For example, if the guidance applies to prepaid programs such as in-game points, what is the regulatory purpose for regulating such programs as money transmission rather than prepaid access?  In other words, how is selling 1,000 “points” for $10 for use within a game any higher risk, requiring a different regulatory regime, than selling $10 of prepaid merchandise on a card?  The net result of the ambiguity created by the Virtual Currency Guidance is a clear need for FinCEN to engage in the formal rule-making process regarding these issues.  In addition to allowing FinCEN an opportunity to clarify the regime it intends to apply to virtual currencies, and which virtual currencies it intends to cover, the rule-making process would allow industry players the full panoply of due process protection to which they are entitled—an opportunity to object, comment and respond to the proposed rules. The Regulatory Landscape for Prepaid Programs Is Left Unsettled Ultimately, in light of the issues discussed above, the Virtual Currency Guidance creates a dichotomy between different types of prepaid programs—with some, yet-to-be-clarified types of prepaid programs and virtual currencies falling under the guidance and others governed by the prepaid access rules.  The guidance is not clear, however, as to where the dividing line lies.  Are all prepaid programs denominated in legal tender governed by prepaid access while all others are governed by the money transmission regulations?  Or, are all “virtual” (a term FinCEN did not define) prepaid programs subject to the money transmitter regulations while more traditional, card-based programs are governed by the prepaid access rules?  In light of the unsettled regulatory landscape left in the wake of the Virtual Currency Guidance, all administrators and exchangers of virtual currencies and prepaid programs, including those that might have previously been characterized as prepaid access programs, should reevaluate their compliance and related regulatory risk and be warned that their former assumptions about the regulatory landscape may need reassessment.  Contact counsel for more information regarding the FinCEN’s Virtual Currency Guidance.

The hope is to crackdown on Bitcoin-related crime. Regulating virtual currencies is tricky because it's hard to do it without admitting that they're legitimate in some way. But given the surge in Bitcoin's popularity—and its utility as the currency of choice for drug dealers, gun runners, and other baddies—the US government had to do something. The new "guidance" issued by the US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is very careful to draw a line between real and virtual currency. The real stuff is official government tender: FinCEN's regulations define currency (also referred to as "real" currency) as "the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that [i] is designated as legal tender and that [ii] circulates and [iii] is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance." Whereas virtual currency is something that sometimes acts like currency but isn't legally accepted: In contrast to real currency, "virtual" currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency. In particular, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. This guidance addresses "convertible" virtual currency. This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency. Now that all makes sense but the distinction is very important to the government. The new rules basically make it clear that even though the government doesn't think that Bitcoin is the real thing, operators like BitPay, which exchange and administer Bitcoin will be treated like businesses who wire money and exchange foreign currency. As the WSJ reports, that basically means that these companies will have some additional bookkeeping requirements, and that they'll have to report transactions of more than $10,000. Whether this new guidance will be enforceable given the untraceable nature of Bitcoin remains to be seen.

However, precise details of its scope of regulation remain undefined. There’s been a marked increase in consumption, usage and discussion around virtual currencies, with Bitcoin the primary focus. Just this month, top domain registrar Namecheap decided to accepts payment in Bitcoins, while Finnish software maker Sc5 last week began allowing its staff to receive parts of their salary in the currency. Also on the radar is Facebook Credits, which, though yet to take off in a major way, serves a possible base of more than 1 billion users. With that in mind, FinCEN has provided some details (and, in doing so, uncertainty) around the status of the new currencies, and their users and operators. The missive explains that users of virtual currencies are not classified as MSB (money services businesses, which fall under FinCEN regulation), but those that manage exchanges or currencies are. Here is the key excerpt, which we’ve broken it up and added bolding for clarity: The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) is issuing this interpretive guidance to clarify the applicability of the regulations implementing the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) to persons creating, obtaining, distributing, exchanging, accepting, or transmitting virtual currencies. A user of virtual currency is not an MSB under FinCEN’s regulations and therefore is not subject to MSB registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations. However, an administrator or exchanger is an MSB under FinCEN’s regulations, specifically, a money transmitter, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person. An administrator or exchanger is not a provider or seller of prepaid access, or a dealer in foreign exchange, under FinCEN’s regulations. At this stage, this clarification does not have any initial impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem. FinCEN clarifies that the response is “not in the form of an administrative ruling” but it does remind ‘administrators’ and ‘exchangers’ — such as YC-backed Coinbase — that they fall under US law, if they are based in the US. Like many things on the Internet, the location issue is tricky given that Bitcoin is not bound by geography like ‘real’ currencies. It remains to be seen how the Treasury would address overseas virtual currency operators that have significant traction in the US, that could be an issue for the future. There is also confusion as to exactly what FinCEN defines as money transmitter. Based on the text, Bitcoin users that sell their virtual currency to others for real money could be classified as transmitting the currency. If so, that would bring them under regulation, and therefore require them to become FinCEN registered, and subject to reporting and record-keeping regulations. However, that is not explicitly spelled out. Bitcoin is seen as being the most disruptive virtual currency — Mega founder Kim Dotcom is a big fan, and wants a Bitcoin credit card — but the guidance also applies to virtual credits, such as those operated by Facebook and a range of entertainment and online games firms. The FinCEN letter certainly doesn’t provide all the answers, but it does show that the government has an eye on the space.

However, an administrator or exchanger is an MSB under FinCEN's regulations, specifically, a money transmitter, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person. An administrator or exchanger is not a provider or seller of prepaid access, or a dealer in foreign exchange, under FinCEN's regulations. Currency vs. Virtual Currency             FinCEN's regulations define currency (also referred to as "real" currency) as "the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that [i] is designated as legal tender and that [ii] circulates and [iii] is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance."3 In contrast to real currency, "virtual" currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency. In particular, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. This guidance addresses "convertible" virtual currency. This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency. Background             On July 21, 2011, FinCEN published a Final Rule amending definitions and other regulations relating to money services businesses ("MSBs").4 Among other things, the MSB Rule amends the definitions of dealers in foreign exchange (formerly referred to as "currency dealers and exchangers") and money transmitters. On July 29, 2011, FinCEN published a Final Rule on Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Prepaid Access (the "Prepaid Access Rule").5 This guidance explains the regulatory treatment under these definitions of persons engaged in virtual currency transactions. Definitions of User, Exchanger, and Administrator             This guidance refers to the participants in generic virtual currency arrangements, using the terms "user," "exchanger," and "administrator."6 A user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services.7 An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. An administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency. Users of Virtual Currency             A user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations.8 Such activity, in and of itself, does not fit within the definition of "money transmission services" and therefore is not subject to FinCEN's registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations for MSBs.9 Administrators and Exchangers of Virtual Currency             An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person.10 FinCEN's regulations define the term "money transmitter" as a person that provides money transmission services, or any other person engaged in the transfer of funds. The term "money transmission services" means "the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means."11             The definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies. Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA.12 FinCEN has reviewed different activities involving virtual currency and has made determinations regarding the appropriate regulatory treatment of administrators and exchangers under three scenarios: brokers and dealers of e-currencies and e-precious metals; centralized convertible virtual currencies; and de-centralized convertible virtual currencies.             a. E-Currencies and E-Precious Metals             The first type of activity involves electronic trading in e-currencies or e-precious metals.13 In 2008, FinCEN issued guidance stating that as long as a broker or dealer in real currency or other commodities accepts and transmits funds solely for the purpose of effecting a bona fide purchase or sale of the real currency or other commodities for or with a customer, such person is not acting as a money transmitter under the regulations.14             However, if the broker or dealer transfers funds between a customer and a third party that is not part of the currency or commodity transaction, such transmission of funds is no longer a fundamental element of the actual transaction necessary to execute the contract for the purchase or sale of the currency or the other commodity. This scenario is, therefore, money transmission.15 Examples include, in part, (1) the transfer of funds between a customer and a third party by permitting a third party to fund a customer's account; (2) the transfer of value from a customer's currency or commodity position to the account of another customer; or (3) the closing out of a customer's currency or commodity position, with a transfer of proceeds to a third party. Since the definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies, the same rules apply to brokers and dealers of e-currency and e-precious metals.             b. Centralized Virtual Currencies             The second type of activity involves a convertible virtual currency that has a centralized repository. The administrator of that repository will be a money transmitter to the extent that it allows transfers of value between persons or from one location to another. This conclusion applies, whether the value is denominated in a real currency or a convertible virtual currency. In addition, any exchanger that uses its access to the convertible virtual currency services provided by the administrator to accept and transmit the convertible virtual currency on behalf of others, including transfers intended to pay a third party for virtual goods and services, is also a money transmitter.             FinCEN understands that the exchanger's activities may take one of two forms. The first form involves an exchanger (acting as a "seller" of the convertible virtual currency) that accepts real currency or its equivalent from a user (the "purchaser") and transmits the value of that real currency to fund the user's convertible virtual currency account with the administrator. Under FinCEN's regulations, sending "value that substitutes for currency" to another person or to another location constitutes money transmission, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies.16 This circumstance constitutes transmission to another location, namely from the user's account at one location (e.g., a user's real currency account at a bank) to the user's convertible virtual currency account with the administrator. It might be argued that the exchanger is entitled to the exemption from the definition of "money transmitter" for persons involved in the sale of goods or the provision of services. Under such an argument, one might assert that the exchanger is merely providing the service of connecting the user to the administrator and that the transmission of value is integral to this service. However, this exemption does not apply when the only services being provided are money transmission services.17             The second form involves a de facto sale of convertible virtual currency that is not completely transparent. The exchanger accepts currency or its equivalent from a user and privately credits the user with an appropriate portion of the exchanger's own convertible virtual currency held with the administrator of the repository. The exchanger then transmits that internally credited value to third parties at the user's direction. This constitutes transmission to another person, namely each third party to which transmissions are made at the user's direction. To the extent that the convertible virtual currency is generally understood as a substitute for real currencies, transmitting the convertible virtual currency at the direction and for the benefit of the user constitutes money transmission on the part of the exchanger.             c. De-Centralized Virtual Currencies             A final type of convertible virtual currency activity involves a de-centralized convertible virtual currency (1) that has no central repository and no single administrator, and (2) that persons may obtain by their own computing or manufacturing effort.             A person that creates units of this convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods and services is a user of the convertible virtual currency and not subject to regulation as a money transmitter. By contrast, a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter. In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency. Providers and Sellers of Prepaid Access             A person's acceptance and/or transmission of convertible virtual currency cannot be characterized as providing or selling prepaid access because prepaid access is limited to real currencies. 18 Dealers in Foreign Exchange             A person must exchange the currency of two or more countries to be considered a dealer in foreign exchange.19 Virtual currency does not meet the criteria to be considered "currency" under the BSA, because it is not legal tender. Therefore, a person who accepts real currency in exchange for virtual currency, or vice versa, is not a dealer in foreign exchange under FinCEN's regulations. * * * * *             Financial institutions with questions about this guidance or other matters related to compliance with the implementing regulations of the BSA may contact FinCEN's Regulatory Helpline at (800) 949-2732. 1 FinCEN is issuing this guidance under its authority to administer the Bank Secrecy Act. See Treasury Order 180-01 (March 24, 2003). This guidance explains only how FinCEN characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies under the Bank Secrecy Act and FinCEN regulations. It should not be interpreted as a statement by FinCEN about the extent to which those activities comport with other federal or state statutes, rules, regulations, or orders. 2 FinCEN's regulations define "person" as "an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a trust or estate, a joint stock company, an association, a syndicate, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization or group, an Indian Tribe (as that term is defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act), and all entities cognizable as legal personalities." 31 CFR § 1010.100(mm). 3 31 CFR § 1010.100(m). 4 Bank Secrecy Act Regulations - Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Money Services Businesses, 76 FR 43585 (July 21, 2011) (the "MSB Rule"). This defines an MSB as "a person wherever located doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized or licensed business concern, wholly or in substantial part within the United States, in one or more of the capacities listed in paragraphs (ff)(1) through (ff)(7) of this section. This includes but is not limited to maintenance of any agent, agency, branch, or office within the United States." 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff). 5 Final Rule - Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Prepaid Access, 76 FR 45403 (July 29, 2011), 6 These terms are used for the exclusive purpose of this regulatory guidance. Depending on the type and combination of a person's activities, one person may be acting in more than one of these capacities. 7 How a person engages in "obtaining" a virtual currency may be described using any number of other terms, such as "earning," "harvesting," "mining," "creating," "auto-generating," "manufacturing," or "purchasing," depending on the details of the specific virtual currency model involved. For purposes of this guidance, the label applied to a particular process of obtaining a virtual currency is not material to the legal characterization under the BSA of the process or of the person engaging in the process. 8 As noted above, this should not be interpreted as a statement about the extent to which the user's activities comport with other federal or state statutes, rules, regulations, or orders. For example, the activity may still be subject to abuse in the form of trade-based money laundering or terrorist financing. The activity may follow the same patterns of behavior observed in the "real" economy with respect to the purchase of "real" goods and services, such as systematic over- or under-invoicing or inflated transaction fees or commissions. 9 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(1-7). 10 FinCEN's regulations provide that whether a person is a money transmitter is a matter of facts and circumstances. The regulations identify six circumstances under which a person is not a money transmitter, despite accepting and transmitting currency, funds, or value that substitutes for currency. 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(A)-(F). 11 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5)(i)(A). 12 Ibid. 13 Typically, this involves the broker or dealer electronically distributing digital certificates of ownership of real currencies or precious metals, with the digital certificate being the virtual currency. However, the same conclusions would apply in the case of the broker or dealer issuing paper ownership certificates or manifesting customer ownership or control of real currencies or commodities in an account statement or any other form. These conclusions would also apply in the case of a broker or dealer in commodities other than real currencies or precious metals. A broker or dealer of e-currencies or e-precious metals that engages in money transmission could be either an administrator or exchanger depending on its business model. 14 Application of the Definition of Money Transmitter to Brokers and Dealers in Currency and other Commodities, FIN-2008-G008, Sept. 10, 2008. The guidance also notes that the definition of money transmitter excludes any person, such as a futures commission merchant, that is "registered with, and regulated or examined bythe Commodity Futures Trading Commission." 15 In 2011, FinCEN amended the definition of money transmitter. The 2008 guidance, however, was primarily concerned with the core elements of the definition - accepting and transmitting currency or value - and the exemption for acceptance and transmission integral to another transaction not involving money transmission. The 2011 amendments have not materially changed these aspects of the definition. 16 See footnote 11 and adjacent text. 17 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(F). 18 This is true even if the person holds the value accepted for a period of time before transmitting some or all of that value at the direction of the person from whom the value was originally accepted. FinCEN's regulations define "prepaid access" as "access to funds or the value of funds that have been paid in advance and can be retrieved or transferred at some point in the future through an electronic device or vehicle, such as a card, code, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, or personal identification number." 31 CFR § 1010.100(ww). Thus, "prepaid access" under FinCEN's regulations is limited to "access to funds or the value of funds." If FinCEN had intended prepaid access to cover funds denominated in a virtual currency or something else that substitutes for real currency, it would have used language in the definition of prepaid access like that in the definition of money transmission, which expressly includes the acceptance and transmission of "other value that substitutes for currency." 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5)(i) . 19 FinCEN defines a "dealer in foreign exchange" as a "person that accepts the currency, or other monetary instruments, funds, or other instruments denominated in the currency, of one or more countries in exchange for the currency, or other monetary instruments, funds, or other instruments denominated in the currency, of one or more other countries in an amount greater than $1,000 for any other person on any day in one or more transactions, whether or not for same-day delivery." 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(1). 12 [sic] As our response is not in the form of an administrative ruling, the substance of this letter should not be considered determinative in any state or federal investigation, litigation, grand jury proceeding, or proceeding before any other governmental body.

Subscribe and save For similar stories, visit the Finance and Economics and US national issues Topic Guides LOOKS like Bitcoin has got too big to ignore. Virtual currencies are to be regulated by the US Treasury after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) moved to clarify their status under anti-money-laundering laws. The move comes as Bitcoins doubled in value in just a few weeks to hit a record high of more than $70 each, possibly fuelled by the banking crisis in Cyprus and the rest of Europe. Bitcoin is run on a decentralised network controlled by its users, making it difficult to regulate transactions within the currency. However, exchanges that swap Bitcoins for real-world currencies, such as MtGox, are another matter. FinCEN's new guidelines don't mention Bitcoin by name, but say that anyone involved in exchanges of decentralised virtual currency for real currency must register as a money services business and obey existing regulations. The same applies for centralised virtual currencies, such as Facebook credits. But in a peer-to-peer currency it is not so obvious what counts as an exchange. Bitcoin "miners", who run software to create Bitcoins, might also have to register if they sell the newly minted currency for its real equivalent. Patrick Murck of the advocacy group Bitcoin Foundation called the guidelines "infeasible for many, if not most, members of the Bitcoin community to comply with".
