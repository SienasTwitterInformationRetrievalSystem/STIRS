Enlarge Close By Charles Dharapak, AP The Obamas greet astronaut Mark Kelly, husband of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday in Washington. Kelly told President Obama and the audience at the Washington Hilton that the past month "has been the hardest time of my life." He questioned why his spouse, an Arizona Democrat, was shot in the head on Jan. 8. "Maybe it was fate. I hadn't been a big believer in fate until recently," he said. FAITH & REASON: Mark Kelly finds God in tragedy. Do you? Giffords is now at a rehabilitation hospital in Houston, where Kelly says "she gets a little better" every day. Kelly offered special prayers sent by Giffords' rabbi, Stephanie Aaron. He also told the audience he hopes that "maybe something good can come from all this." The FBI has said that Giffords, 40, was the target of a shooting rampage that left six people dead and 13 wounded. Kelly, a Navy captain and astronaut, kept vigil by his wife's bedside while she was hospitalized at University Medical Center in Tucson. She was transferred on Jan. 21 and is now undergoing therapy and treatment at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston, where Kelly is based. Kelly will announce today whether he will command the space shuttle Endeavour's final voyage in April as scheduled, the Associated Press reported. He took a leave from training after the shooting but is scheduled to take part in a news conference at the Johnson Space Center. Obama, who spoke about how his Christian faith has deepened while he has been in the White House, began his remarks with a nod to Kelly and Giffords. "We are with them for the long haul, and God is with them for the long haul," he said. Obama says nothing promotes prayer like the presidency. "Let me tell you, these two years, they have deepened my faith," he said. In discussing how the presidency has "a funny way of making a person feel the need to pray," Obama cited the challenges of the economy, health care and foreign policy — as well as the fact that his Christian faith has been "questioned from time to time." Office of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords via AP Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and husband Mark Kelly before she was shot on Jan. 8. Though polls have shown that as many as 20% of Americans say he is a Muslim, Obama said that as a young community organizer in Chicago, "I came to know Jesus Christ for myself and embrace him as my Lord and savior." Faith has sustained him in high office, Obama said, citing a quote from a predecessor: "Abe Lincoln said ... 'I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.' " Political opponents can come together in prayer, Obama said. He pointed out a member of the audience: Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, a conservative Republican who rarely agrees with the president on policy. "Even though we are on opposite sides of a whole bunch of issues, part of what has bound us together is a shared faith, our recognition that we pray to and serve the same God," Obama said. Then he joked, "And I keep praying that God will show him the light and he will vote with me once in a while." "It's going to happen, Tom," Obama added to laughter. "A ray of light is going to beam down." For more information about reprints & permissions, visit our FAQ's. To report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS Dr. Dong Kim in charge of Gabrielle Giffords' neurological recovery Kim is chairman of the dept. of neurosurgery at the University of Texas Medical School Doctor says medicine was not his first love; it was writing Houston, Texas (CNN) -- The doctor currently in charge of Gabrielle Giffords' neurological recovery, the man who's had his very hands in Giffords' brain, was once mistaken for a kung fu expert. It was 1972, and the second-graders at Ed Smith Elementary School in Syracuse, New York, didn't quite know what to make of Dong Kim, the boy who'd just arrived from Korea. "There were probably not that many Asian people there at that time, so a lot of the kids just assumed I knew kung fu," Kim remembered, laughing. "I got some notoriety out of that. I knew nothing about kung fu, but I could kind of fake it and impress people, or at least impress other 7-year olds." That boy grew up to be chairman of the director of the Mischer Neuroscience Institute at Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center. Giffords came under his care last week when she was transferred to Texas from the University Medical Center in Arizona. On Monday, Kim removed a drain from Giffords' brain, which had been placed there to remove excess fluid. Kim, whose father was studying library science at Syracuse University, recalls his early days in the United States sitting in a classroom not understanding anything "a little anxiety-provoking, but I felt pretty comfortable." He enjoyed math from the beginning, since the numbers made sense, and within the year, he learned English. "I do think that the immigrant experience is quite a strong one," he said. "I remember growing up feeling strongly that my parents had come here for me and my sister. I remember them commenting over and over again what a great country this was and how we're lucky to be here. I think that kind of instills in you that you're getting this real opportunity and you should try to take advantage of it." Kim's family later moved to Southern California, and he received his bachelor's degree from Stanford University. Medicine was not his first love. Fluid in Giffords' brain being drained Giffords tolerating agressive therapy Rep. Giffords moved to rehab facility RELATED TOPICS Gabrielle Giffords Brain Injuries "At 18 or 19, I was trying to write the great American novel, but I would stare at the page for an hour and half and get two sentences out, so that's not good," he said, laughing. "What I wrote didn't read well, even to me." By his junior year at Stanford, Kim had taken an interest in medicine, and he received his medical degree from the University of California-San Francisco. Within a few years of finishing his residency, he arrived at one of his chosen fields of research, the genetics of brain aneurysms, a condition in which a blood vessel bulges out and can later rupture and bleed, causing a stroke. His interest lay partly in his own family history. Three of his four grandparents died of brain hemorrhages, or bleeding in the brain, as did his 37-year-old uncle, a surgeon who Kim says was kidnapped by the North Koreans. Kim and his team discovered several genes related to aneurysms. He had his parents tested, and both were negative. Another area of research involves using stem cells from a patient's skin to treat spinal cord injuries. The treatments they developed have allowed paralyzed rats to walk again, and they hope to begin studies in humans in the next two to three years. Kim says his favorite part of his work is when a patient returns to his office after undergoing a traumatic illness, such as a brain injury, stroke or tumor. "When I first meet a new patient with a new problem, it's tough for everybody. They're upset. I'm worried about them. I feel for what they're going through, and it's the best thing to get them through it," he says. The hardest part of his job is when things don't go so well. Sometimes, for example, he has a patient with cancer, and there are few treatments. Or "even worse," he said, is when a patient has a surgical complication. "No matter who you are, a few times a year, that happens, and the thought that you did something, even though you were trying to help them, and things didn't go well, is very, very difficult," he says. "But nobody's perfect, and you can't have a 100% success rate." As for his most famous patient, Kim has very little to say aside from a few comments at news conferences. At a recent interview with CNN, a public relations representative from his hospital interrupted whenever a question was asked about Giffords. When asked whether he couldn't speak because the hospital had limited him or because Giffords' family had asked him not to, he laughed. "I don't know if I can comment on not commenting," he said. "It would be dishonest if I said (treating Giffords) wasn't different, because there's all this scrutiny. Everybody's calling," he added. "Certainly, that heightens the situation." But he knows that doing anything different for her, breaking with regular protocol, would be a mistake. "I think the best way to handle it is in the mechanics of care of the patient is to do everything the same," he said. "I think you can potentially get into trouble when you try to start doing things differently or making exceptions."

Just 12 days after the shooting, they reported that Giffords was practicing one of her favorite pastimes, scrolling through an iPad. Just weeks earlier she told “The Daily” she liked to use it to communicate with her constituents. “I like to show folks how I get my news, I like to be able to show them how I keep up with our social media. We’re one of the top social networkers in the Congress and a lot of that is managed through the iPad, so that’s pretty cool,” said Giffords. Kelly is no stranger to high tech gadgets, either. As an astronaut, he has a mastery of aeronautics few can comprehend. Earlier this week, he sent out a tweet on his Twitter page, which said, “Today was a huge day for GG, lot’s of progress.” And as we learned from his wife, he also likes using the iPad, especially when he gets to use it with her. “My husband and I both have iPads,” Giffords said with a smile and a giggle, “we got them at the same time, so sometimes we’re in bed together showing each other our stuff on our iPad, so it’s a great tool and a lot of fun.” Kelly told an audience at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning that his wife continues to improve daily. We will await his future tweets on her progress, and open our iPads to “The Daily” for more information.

ABC News Blogs > Politics > Political Punch Political Punch Headlines Politics Entertainment Health Lifestyle Business Technology Obama On Faith: Praying for Egypt, Gabby Giffords…And For Patience As Malia Goes To Her First Dance With Boys   Email Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print By Kristina Feb 3, 2011 11:13am ABC News’ Sunlen Miller reports: At the National Prayer Breakfast, in a personal speech about his own faith President Obama today said he’s praying for the situation in Egypt, Gabby Giffords’ continued recovery….and that his daughter Malia’s skirt will get longer as she’s about to go to her first dance with boys. “We pray that the violence in Egypt will end and that the rights and aspirations of the Egyptian people will be realized, and that a better day will dawn over Egypt and throughout the world,” the president said at the breakfast at the Washington Hilton hotel this morning. The undertone of the prayer breakfast this morning though was the tragedy in Tucson. Gabby Giffords’ husband, Mark Kelly gave the closing prayer – in which he updated the nation on his wife’s recovery. “Every day she gets a little better,” Mark Kelly said of his wife’s recovery, “the slope of that curve is important.” Kelly said that over the last month he’s had to rely on his faith  – and told his wife two days ago that maybe what happened to her was fate, part of a larger plan, something that he had not believed in before this tragedy. “I thought the world just spins and the clocks just tick and things happen for no particular reason,” he said, “I can only hope, and I told Gabby the other night, that maybe it’s possible that it’s just one small part of that same plan that the horrible and tragic was not merely random and that something good can come from all this.” Kelly repeated the prayer given by Giffords’ rabbi over her hospital bed the night of the shooting. President Obama told Mark Kelly the nation is with their family for the long haul. “We have been praying for Mark’s wife, Gabby Giffords, for many days now, but I want Gabby and Mark and their entire family to know that we are with them for the long haul, and God is with them for the long haul.” The president spoke personally about his faith, as he does on rare occasion, mentioning how a tragedy like Tucson can make some reach out to faith even more. “Often it takes a brush with hardship or tragedy to shake us out of that to remind us of what matters most,” the president said, “we watch a gunman open fire in a supermarket, and we remember how fleeting life can be. And we ask ourselves, how we have treated others, whether we’ve told our family and friends how much we love them. And it’s in these moments when we feel most intensely our mortality and our own flaws and the sins of the world that we most desperately seek to touch the face of God.” The president said that his own “faith journey” has had its “twist and turns.” He joked that he now prays for his teenage daughter, Malia, just entering the world of dating. “My prayers sometimes are general: Lord, given me the strength to meet the challenges of my office. Sometimes they’re specific: Lord, give me patience as I watch Malia go to her first dance. Where there will be boys. Lord, have that skirt get longer as she travels to that dance.” The president said he also prays for humility, something that is given to him by his wife. “God answered this prayer for me early on by having me marry Michelle because whether it’s reminding me of a chore undone, or questioning the wisdom of watching my third football game in a row on Sunday she keeps me humble. “ Calling his faith a “sustaining force” the president noted that at times his faith has been questioned. “My Christian faith, then, has been a sustaining force for me over these last few years — all the more so when Michelle and I hear our faith questioned from time to time. We are reminded that ultimately what matters is not what other people say about us but whether we’re being true to our conscience and true to our God.” The president said that in a life of politics when “debates have become so bitterly polarized and changes in the media lead so many of us just to listen to those who reinforce our existing biases,” that it is useful to go back to scripture to  “remind ourselves that none of us has all the answers — none of us, no matter what our political party or our station in life. “ The president said that the “full breadth of human knowledge is like a grain of sand in God’s hands. And there are some mysteries in this world we cannot fully comprehend. “ With a large smile the president said that in the last two years president his faith has been deepened. “The presidency has a funny way of making a person feel the need to pray. Abe Lincoln said, as many of you know: I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.” The president said his faith helps him from being “overwhelmed,” and reminds him that “despite being just one very imperfect man, I can still help whoever I can however I can wherever I can for as long as I can, and that somehow God will buttress these efforts.”   Email Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.

The 11-member bi-partisan union, active in the last Congress as well, promotes the interests of motorcycling and motorcycle safety in the U.S. House of Representatives. Representative Gabrielle Giffords will continue to co-chair the Congressional Motorcycle Safety Caucus. The MIC and AMA have both issued statements of support for the formal recognition of the Congressional Motorcycle Caucus in the 112th Congress. Giffords, a Democrat representing Arizona’s 8th District,  chairs the caucus with Texas Republican Michael Burgess. A rider for more than 20 years, Giffords continues to recover from an assassination attempt during a Tucson shooting rampage that claimed six lives. The Motorcycle Industry Council and American Motorcyclist Association issued statements of support for Giffords and the caucus. “We are honored that Congressman Burgess will once again serve as Co-chair of the Caucus, and we are especially heartened that Representative Gifford’s will remain as a co-chair as well,” said MIC Senior Vice President of Government Relations, Kathy Van Kleeck. “Giffords is a rider herself and has always been enthusiastic about motorcycle safety. We look forward to her continued recovery and return to the House.” "It's great to have Reps. Burgess and Giffords back as leaders of the Congressional Motorcycle Caucus," said AMA Senior Vice President for Government Relations, Ed Moreland. "The Congressional Motorcycle Caucus is made up of dedicated members of Congress who ensure that motorcyclists aren't forgotten on Capitol Hill. Reps. Burgess and Giffords have proven that they are true friends of motorcycling. "We look forward to working with our old friends in the Congressional Motorcycle Caucus, as well as new members who join, to help protect and promote the motorcycling lifestyle," Moreland said. The Congressional Motorcycle Caucus urged riders to participate in the June 15th Ride to Work Day, with Giffords cutting a promotional video for the annual event (embedded below). The caucus and its members have sponsored other House resolutions in support of motorcycle safety, including May’s Motorcycle Safety Month.
