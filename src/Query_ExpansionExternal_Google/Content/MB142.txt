Kerry charged Sunday. During an unannounced trip to Baghdad, Kerry lobbied Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for greater scrutiny of flights that cross Iraq. He appeared to make little headway with Maliki, a Shiite with long-standing ties to Iran and little inclination to do U.S. bidding 10 years after the American invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. Maliki is a prickly leader whose relations with U.S. officials have grown more strained since the departure of American forces and the re-emergence of widespread sectarian violence in Iraq. Maliki’s consolidation of power worries his U.S. backers. His dealings with Shiite Iran worry them more. “Iraq’s success will take enormous cooperation,” Kerry said. “It’ll take dialogue, and it’ll take courage. It’ll require the resolve to defend the sovereignty of the country and its airspace. . . . “We all want to see Iraq succeed. There’s such an enormous investment of our treasure, our people and our money in this initiative.” 1 of 56 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad Caption It has been a decade since American forces entered Iraq. The long intervention produced these enduring images.   Buy Photo The Obama administration has been unable to persuade Iraq to block overflights from Iran or even to perform regular inspections. “We had a very spirited discussion,” Kerry said after the meeting with Maliki, “and I made it very clear to the prime minister that the overflights from Iran are, in fact, helping to sustain President Assad and his regime.” Kerry began the session with Maliki by joking that he had been assured that the Iraqi leader would “do everything that I say.” Maliki had a good-natured reply: “We won’t do it,” he said through an interpreter. Both men smiled. Iraq says Iranian flights over its territory carry only humanitarian supplies for the civil war in next-door Syria, and the only two known inspections of Iranian aircraft found just those supplies. The United States says the sheer volume of flights and overland vehicle traffic to Syria through Iraq points to regular arms shipments. A senior U.S. official traveling with Kerry said there are flights nearly every day. The official would not say how the United States is certain that the planes are carrying weapons for Assad, an Iranian ally, but repeatedly asserted that is the case. “We know” the contents, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview Kerry’s argument to Maliki. Iraq is not part of a U.S.- and European-led group of nations backing the Syrian rebels in their effort to oust Assad. The leader of the main U.S.-backed Syrian opposition group resigned Sunday amid infighting. Kerry said he was sorry, but not surprised, to see Mouaz al-Khatib leave. “It’s almost inevitable, in the transition of a group such as the opposition, for these kinds of changes to take place as it evolves,” Kerry said. Addressing the prospects for talks between Israel and the Palestinians after President Obama’s recent Middle East visit, Kerry was cautious. “All of us have learned in the course of the last years, through many presidents and many secretaries of state, there has been no more intractable problem,” he said. “And so, expressing optimism when you don’t even have negotiations would be foolhardy. What I have is hope.” In Iraq, Kerry also pressed Maliki to reconsider a decision to postpone local elections in two Sunni-majority provinces and to share power more equally with Sunnis and Kurds. The secretary also invoked Iraq’s first free election, in 2005, to urge Maliki to revisit the issue. “No country knows more about voting under difficult circumstances than Iraq,” Kerry said at a news conference at the U.S. Embassy. Iraq remains badly divided along sectarian lines, with near-daily killings and terrorist attacks attributed to sectarian rivalries. The Shiite-led cabinet last week postponed the elections, scheduled for April 20, for up to six months in Anbar and Nineveh provinces, citing threats to electoral workers. “It would be disingenuous not to come here and say that there is a great deal of work yet to do. The United States is clear-eyed about the challenges that are still presented here in Iraq,” Kerry said. Kerry’s visit comes at a low point for American influence. The Obama administration was unable to negotiate a long-term security agreement with the Maliki government, leading to the departure of all U.S. forces and most civilians by late 2011. The mammoth U.S. Embassy in downtown Baghdad, the largest and most expensive in the world, is downsizing from more than 16,000 employees to about 5,000 this year. Only about 1,000 of those left will be diplomats. The United States also is dismantling the vestiges of a police training program once envisioned as its signature contribution to postwar Iraq, in an acknowledgment of Iraqis’ lack of interest in a multibillion-dollar investment designed to bolster the country’s troubled judicial system. Kerry’s trip is the first to Iraq by a U.S. secretary of state since Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled here in 2009, and it comes amid growing criticism from Iraqi officials, who say the United States has not done enough to build a strong postwar relationship with Baghdad. American officials say that they are committed to building a stronger relationship with Iraq but that the country’s deadlocked politics, security concerns and endemic corruption have hindered U.S. investment. Overall, Ambassador Stephen Beecroft said in a recent interview, the United States has made significant contributions to Iraq, the many missteps of the war notwithstanding. “It’s a vastly different place,” Beecroft said, reflecting on the U.S. legacy in Iraq. “It basically took Iraq from a very limited society that had very limited options and opportunities for its people and opened those up to a democratic system that provides much more in the way of freedom and choices and opportunities.” Many Iraqis have a dimmer view of the situation in their country, citing a stubborn insurgency, rising sectarian tension and a political crisis that has led Sunnis and Kurds to boycott Maliki’s Shiite-run government. No Kurdish leaders came to Baghdad to meet Kerry. Ernesto Londoño and Karen DeYoung contributed to this report.

M.   March 15, 2013 SHARE TWEET Iranian weapons continue to pour into Syria via Iraq, in direct violation of the United Nations arms embargo on Iran, Western officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  The report claims that these shipments, "range from communications equipment to light arms and advanced strategic weapons, some of which are being used devastatingly by Hezbollah and the Syrian regime against the Syrian people." Iran's continued violation of UN sanctions should not come as a surprise, as they continue to pursue the development of nuclear weapons even though their economy is being crippled by UN sanctions. The U.S. Treasury Department has blacklisted Iran Air, Mahan Air and Yas Air for supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, but does it really matter? I don't think so. At this point, Iran is becoming a much larger player in the Syrian War than the U.S. wants to admit. It's not like the U.S. is getting much help from other members of the UN Security Council, as Russia continues to criticizes the U.S., European and Gulf Arab governments for their aid to Syrian rebels seeking to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The most the U.S. could do is pressure other members of the Security Council to increase sanctions on Iran for violating the arms embargo.  Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran's U.N. mission, was quoted in the same report as saying, "Unfortunately the situation in Syria and the whole Middle East region is becoming more and more delicate and risky because of foreign interference and funneling of arms to the extremist groups," and reiterated that Tehran wanted to end the conflict through dialogue between the government and opposition. These actions and statements lead one to believe that Iran will continue to support the Syrian government, and expects that even if the United States increases sanctions it would not have any meaningful impact on their operations. Yes, current sanctions have crippled their economy, but it hasn't stopped the Iranian government from continuing its nuclear weapons research and I don't believe increased sanctions with stop the continued flow of Iranian weapons to Syria, either.      Like us on Facebook: SHARE TWEET M.

The officials said Iran is acting to protect Syria from further possible Israeli airstrikes. On Friday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Iran had stepped up its military and financial aid to the Syrian government. She did not divulge any more details. She was speaking after last week’s Israeli strike in Syria. The Syrian army claimed Israeli war planes had bombed a military research center northwest of Damascus, but the U.S. and others said the targets were convoys carrying weapons intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon. In Beirut on Thursday, Syria’s ambassador said Damascus could make “a surprise decision to respond to the aggression of the Israeli warplanes.” He gave no details but said Syria was “defending its sovereignty and its land.” Regarding Syrian chemical weapons, in December WND reported Iran had passed nonconventional weapons to Syria for possible use in the event the regime of Bashar al-Assad faces imminent collapse, according to knowledgeable Middle Eastern security officials. Last month, WND reported Israeli special forces were operating inside Syria to track the country’s non-conventional weapons as well as any such weapons that may be in possession of the rebels, according to informed Middle Eastern intelligence sources. The sources confirmed a Sunday Times report from December that also noted Israeli special forces were on the ground in Syria working as spotters to track the regime’s stocks of chemical and biological weapons. “For years we’ve known the exact location of Syria’s chemical and biological munitions,” an Israeli source told the Sunday Times. “But in the past week we’ve got signs that munitions have been moved to new locations.” Text smaller Text bigger Follow WND On Facebook: Twitter: Follow @worldnetdaily Contribute Contact Us Send a Link Send Corrections Send a Tip Send Photos/Videos Send comments Note: Read our discussion guidelines before commenting.

He may be reached at atahlert@comcast.net.   Print This Post The Obama administration’s abandonment of Iraq in its final stages of transition, leaving it to drift into the orbit of Iran, is beginning to reap enormous consequences. According to a Western intelligence report obtained by Reuters, Iran has been using civilian aircraft flying over Iraqi airspace to ship tons of weapons and military personnel to Syria, aiding Syrian President Bashar Assad’s effort to crush the rebel uprising against his government. The transfers have reportedly been organized by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. “This is part of a revised Iranian modus operandi that U.S. officials have only recently addressed publicly, following previous statements to the contrary,” said the report, a copy of which was provided to Reuters by a U.N. diplomatic source. “It also flies in the face of declarations by Iraqi officials. Planes are flying from Iran to Syria via Iraq on an almost daily basis, carrying IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) personnel and tens of tons of weapons to arm the Syrian security forces and militias fighting against the rebels.” The report also reveals that Iran is “continuing to assist the regime in Damascus by sending trucks overland via Iraq” as well. In early September, U.S. officials revealed they had been asking Iraq about the flights, with then-Senator John Kerry threatening a review of U.S. aid to Iraq if the flights were not stopped. Yet American efforts to get the Iraqi government to randomly inspect the flights have been largely rebuffed. An ostensible commitment made in September by Iraq’s foreign minister to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that such inspections would take place was little more than a charade. Iraq inspected all of two planes as of late October, one of which was on its way back from Syria after delivering a shipment there. No weapons were found, possibly because American intelligence reports reveal that Iraqi officials warned the Iranians when the inspections would take place. Although charges regarding such operations aren’t new, the report alleges that the scope of them is far more extensive and far more coordinated than previously acknowledged, due in large part to an agreement forged between senior officials from both Iraq and Iran. Thus, as the New York Times puts it, the “air corridor over Iraq has emerged as a main supply route for weapons, including rockets, antitank missiles, rocket-propelled grenade and mortars” on their way to Syria. Ali al-Moussawi, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki’s media adviser, dismissed the report’s findings. “Iraq rejects baseless allegations that it allows Iran to use its airspace to ship arms to Syria,” he said. “The prime minister has always called for a peaceful solution to the Syrian conflict and … the need for a ban on any state interfering in Syria whether by sending arms or helping others to do so.” Interviews conducted by the Times with administration, military and congressional officials, most of whom requested anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, say otherwise. “The abuse of Iraqi airspace by Iran continues to be a concern,” an American official said. “We urge Iraq to be diligent and consistent in fulfilling its international obligations and commitments, either by continuing to require flights over Iraqi territory en route to Syria from Iran to land for inspection, or by denying overflight requests for Iranian aircraft going to Syria.” Furthermore, an Iraqi official, who also requested anonymity because he feared Iraqi government retaliation, claimed that some government officials favor Iranian intervention in Syria. As a result of those sentiments, efforts to address U.S. concerns have been minimal. None of this should surprise. Obama’s decision to bring American troops home without leaving a large enough stabilizing force behind was publicly portrayed as a triumph by the president. In a speech given on October 21, 2011, Obama talked about bringing the war in Iraq “to a responsible end–for the sake of our national security and to strengthen American leadership around the world.” Yet as the New York Times revealed at the time, “some top American military officials were dismayed by the announcement, seeing it as the president’s putting the best face on a breakdown in tortured negotiations with the Iraqis.” Yet is was not merely a breakdown in those negotiations that were completely mishandled. According to officials interviewed by the Times, “the arguments of two White House officials, Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, and his deputy, Denis McDonough, prevailed over those of the military” with regard to deciding the number of troops that would remain behind. That decision was based on intelligence assessments that Iraq was “not at great risk of slipping into chaos in the absence of American forces.” Yet when American troops withdrew, Iran began taking advantage of the reality that Iraq has no air force, and is incapable of controlling its own airspace. They began shipping weapons and military personnel to Syria almost immediately. Facing pressure from America, Iraq managed to get Iran to stop the flights last March, when Baghdad was preparing to host a summit of Arab nations. Obama kept up the pressure with an April 3 phone call to Maliki, emphasizing that the flights should not be resumed. Yet when a high-ranking member of Assad’s government was killed in a bombing last July, Iran resumed the flights. They continued to do so despite two more efforts made by administration officials to persuade Maliki. One was a phone call made by Biden to Maliki in August, the other a face-to-face meeting between Maliki and deputy national security adviser Denis McDonough in October. Neither effort gained any traction. American intelligence efforts regarding the aforementioned collusion between Iran and Iraq officials on inspections have centered on Hadi al-Amiri, Iraq’s minister of transportation, who reportedly has close ties with the Iranians. Amiri denied the allegations, even as he remained defiant. “This is untrue,” he insisted. “We are an independent country and our stance is clear. We will search whichever plane we want, whenever we want. We will not take orders.” Nasir Bender, the head of civil aviation in Iraq also insisted that there was no evidence of collusion, even as he offered a dubious excuse to explain why only two planes had been subject to inspection. “We can’t search every plane because there are so many heading to Syria,” he said. “It would be a big waste of money. Each plane we take down we must refill with fuel.” That’s assuming they can get Iranian cooperation in the first place. American intelligence reveals that, on at least one occasion, an Iranian aircraft ignored a request to land made by the Iraqi government, likely because there was something worth hiding on board. The Western intelligence report cites two specific planes, an Iran Air plane with the tail number EP-ICD, and Mahan Air’s EP-MNE, as being involved in arms shipment to Syria. They are two of the 117 aircraft blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury Department in September. Yet such blacklisting is largely toothless, with Treasury noting that they do nothing more than “make it easier for interested parties to keep track of this blocked property, and more difficult for Iran to use deceptive practices to try to evade sanctions.” The foot-dragging by the Maliki government is motivated by calculations broader than pleasing or displeasing the Obama administration. Maliki’s Shi’ite-dominated regime might be indirectly threatened by the fall of Assad in that it could encourage Iraq’s Sunni Muslim and Kurdish factions to challenge it. Maliki is already dealing with massive protests by Sunnis who believe they have been marginalized by his government. A victory of largely Sunni rebels over Assad–who is supported by Shi’ite Iran–might provide the spark for a full scale civil war in Iraq. Terrorist activity remains a problem as well: attacks with significant numbers of casualties have been perpetrated on a monthly basis ever since American troops were withdrawn in December 2011. Thus, Obama’s chickens are coming home to roost. No doubt the administration would like Americans to assume that they did the best they could to get an extension from the Iraqi government to keep forces in the country. Yet it remains a fact that the failure to do so worked out just fine for a president whose “core commitment” was the complete withdrawal of American forces from Iraq by the end of 2011–a commitment frequently mentioned during the 2012 presidential campaign. Not mentioned during the campaign? American ties to Iraq have been prematurely and unnecessarily weakened, even as Iranian influence grows stronger. The Obama administration has been reduced to carping from the sidelines while Iran exploits Iraqi airspace with impunity to arm their satellite regime in Syria. Iraq itself may be destabilizing, a reality that would betray the decades-long efforts of American soldiers and the thousands of lives spent in the process. The Obama administration, the Democratic Party and the mainstream media have convinced a majority of Americans that not only withdrawing from Iraq, but getting out of the Middle East in general, is a good idea. What they fail to mention is who will step into the ensuing power vacuum. Iran, an apocalyptic regime with ambitions of imposing a worldwide caliphate by any means necessary, is undoubtedly willing to do so. Freedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.

Adina kutnicki, Israel – http://adinakutnicki.com/about/ JacksonPearson You can bet your last penny, that the Obama administration are well aware of what's coming down in the Middle East, and especially Iranian arms being shipped through Iraq. This is all happening by design. Kathy The American people are behind Israel, as well as most of our lawmakers. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean a whole lot when we have a president who isn’t. They say actions speak louder than words, and when it comes to the American President, we know who he stands behind. I enjoy reading your posts, AdinaK; Keep speaking the truth, and God bless you! EarlyBird No, Adkina. George W. Bush set the "fires" in the Middle East in 2003 by launching a counter-productive, disastrous war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy folly of an American since Vietnam. It broke open Iraq and made it a failed state vulnerable to Islamists, strengthened Iran, and led to the chaos in the Middle East right now. Perhaps worst – because there is a direct link between a nation's fiscal health and ability to defend itself – the TRILLION dollar debt that Bush racked up in that war has put the US on the brink to fiscal ruin, and our enemies know that. They know we will not make any major military commitments because WE CANNOT AFFORD TO. Larry You could always black list them via charring. WilliamJamesWard Amazing how well Democracy is working in Iraq, no matter who wins and election you get a snake talking with a forked tongue, here a snake there a snake everywhere a snake. Iraqui religious police started purifying it's population by killing teenagers who displayed western syle clothing and haircust taking them out of school and stoning them. Nothing said by Obama about the purge, it was and immediate sign of his failure and the message, nothing American will be tolerated to the pleasure of Islamists everywhere. Leftists and Islamists will leave confusion, destruction and ruin as a result of thier very existence….not worth one drop of American blood……………………………………William SCREW SOCIALISM Same applies to Aghanistan. EarlyBird What did you expect when you were cheering W. Bush on during his invasion, William? Did you really believe that Iraqis would be throwing flowers at our GIs as they quoted Jefferson, as the necons told us they would? Obama is now responsible for not going back in time and correcting Bush's blunders as they occurred? He's responsible for now not being able to recreate an entire Arab culture and politics? Hey, I thought it was lefties who though the was the "Messiah." WilliamJamesWard What makes you think I cheered the invasion of Iraq. Actually I was against it but would have been satisfied if Sadam and his top 100 villians met with timely and justified ends without all of the insane fanfare and shock and awe. Total waste of people, treasure and property. It turns out Iran and not so much Sadam was behind 9/11 but they are all bad guys who when they vacate open up a place for the next bad guy, thier culture is one of extreme evil that hopefully one day will meet justice………………..William EarlyBird Sorry for my assumption. WilliamJamesWard Hey it's easy to get caught up and you know, kind of flip the bird early………..William SAM000 William; At 2009 the Iraqis elected a pro-American secular and democrat named Ayaz Alawi for the office, but USA supported the loser who was Iran's favorite illegally, so the current Iraqi PM is occupying office illegally.

A region under control of the Muslim Brotherhood, armed and financed by the USA with one enemy Israel targeted by them all. All the while kowtowing to the world adopting a posture of a weakened Nation. He openly admits that he has gone to Pakistan with a male friend this is where he was indoctrinated into the Brotherhood, just look at his history supporting Islamic expansion, even over the needs of Our Nation. EarlyBird What you're missing is that Bush wanted and expected that the "example" set in Iraq would lead Arabs everywhere to insist on self-determination. He specifically stated this numerous times. He in fact took credit for the very brief "spring" in Lebanon and said it related to his invasion of Iraq. Geppettwo This would have been entirely predictable had the west, primarily America, not been totally mesmerized by the notion that “Islam is a religion of peace” and that the animus against the west and in particular America, was our fault, the favorite stance of the American and the west's “hate Israel, hate America” crowd. Not that it was any different with former president Bush or Clinton, but more-so with Obama. Despite the evidence mounting daily of the true nature of the threat of impending violence and war posed by Islamic Jihad, the west's reaction is deny its existence and dig itself deeper into its own erroneous and dangerously inept analysis, unable to accept what should be painfully obvious to any not blinded by the predominant and ever persistent dogma. The most dangerous and violent entity on the planet is not North Korea or China or a reemerging Russian Bear but the predominantly orthodox Muslim regions around the globe intent on establishing Islam and its immutable code of jurisprudence, Sharia, as the one and only legitimate system of justice in an Islamic world. This is not one big country but many and the so called “Arab Spring” uprising was a watershed event, not in the fulfillment of the west's naive aspirations of a shift towards western democracy but a rise to prominence of the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization dedicated to the west's destruction. If the west has learned nothing else from this Iraq, Afghanistan experience and the intractable nature of the so called “two state solution,” it should be that a desire for western style democracy among the indigenous people in the Muslim world is non existent and, to many, abhorrent. If these Islamic Jihadists succeed all those who do not submit, those they refer to as the unbelievers, will pay a tax (Jizyah), adopt a social position of servitude, slaves to their Muslim masters, or be killed. Jews being the most hated, “apes and pigs,” will only have the last option. “Palestine will be free from the Jordan to the sea.” This concept of a global Caliphate is so outrageous, in this the 21st century, that western society cannot bring itself to believe what is growing more prominent daily before their eyes. It is such an alien concept. How can it be other than the ravings of lunatics or the newly coined term, “Islamophobes”? Until the west can extricate itself from that notion this kind of seemingly illogical confusion and hand wringing will continue. It's time to realize that this whole exercise in military intervention intended to defeat a small, rogue band of terrorists led by one leader, Osama Bin Laden and devoid of any perspective regarding the true nature and identity of the enemy, a situation that persists and even grows more disconnected from this abominable reality today, was an exercise in futility. The Muslim world at large, those who strongly approve of governance by Sharia law, are in fact the enemy of western civilization. This includes a growing number who have established solid footholds in France, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Australia, the US and others and, where they have settled in significant numbers, making increasingly belligerent demands for indigent locals to adapt to the needs of their Muslim culture. Multiculturalism at its worst. And to those who take the domestic Muslim apologists, CAIR, ISNA, MSA, MAS, IIIT, etc. who constantly whine about even the slightest criticism of Islam and declare themselves dedicated to the proposition of peace, what should the west expect? That they will openly declare themselves as intractable enemies while in a weak, minority position? They will not attempt any overt action on foreign soil until they've established strong footholds, a process made infinitely easier by the wests notions of lax immigration policies, political correctness, multiculturalism, freedom of religion, accommodation and appeasement. The “destruction of its (the west's) miserable house by their hands………” part of the Muslim Brotherhood's creed. Hoist us on our own petard. Defeating this threat will require what western civilization dreads the most, all out war. Or, if the west can get its act together, a less violent approach; a concerted, determined effort to marginalize the threat by a steady grind towards isolation and impoverishment. This has not been possible before the recently improved technology and unjustly criticized practice of extracting previously unreachable and surprisingly huge reserves of oil and gas being discovered all over the world, most especially here in America and in Israel, who has or will become completely energy independent, by the process of fracking. But, given the acquisition of nuclear weaponry and the devout Muslim's acceptance of death in the cause of Allah as their immediate ticket to paradise, all out war and near annihilation may be the only path to victory by either side. Those devoted to their orthodox Muslim faith will not be deterred by MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction. May the best man wake up, take the bit in his teeth, bite the ugly bullet and get on with an effective strategy or face the inevitable. We will not likely be left with a peaceful option if any remain available. EarlyBird How are you able to get so much bandwidth on FPM? I am limited to small posts at a time. Geppettwo I generally start out thinking "be brief and to the point" and end getting carried away. My only problem with these long posts is losing access over time. I beat that by writng long posts in a comment file, then re-access the article and do an immediate copy/paste in the comment field. geneww1938 Friends, What Obama helped to do there is what will happen here. The One World Government can not exist [comfortably] with strong independent leaders and countries in the world. They also can not rule comfortably in the presence of Godly people [Judeo-Christians]. This is really a battle between evil and righteousness. You must pick your side. You may die for one or the other and eternity is too long and life is too short to be wrong about God, His Bible, Jesus or salvation. EarlyBird Grow up. It was a good Judeo-Christian who broke apart Iraq and left it open for terrorists to begin with. Bush's good Christian war is what made Iran stronger. It is what made America weaker. You can not possibly be blind to the massive failure which was the Iraq War, and blame the affects of it on Obama. EarlyBird What a disgraceful pile of garbage this propaganda by Ahlert is. It makes Dan Greenfield look honest. Obama is following the very treaty that existed when he took office, which was signed by George W. Bush, a legally binding treaty between the US and Iraq (you know, a soverign government), to get all combat troops out of the country by December 31st, 2012. At least Ahlert doesn't pretend that it was a good idea to invade, or that it successful in any way. Bush chose to get us into a counter-productive war that cost us nearly 5,000 American lives, countless maimed Americans, hundreds of thousands killed and maimed Iraqis, a stronger Iran, and now…an Iraq which is broken and open to Iranian and Islamist influence as never before. Everyone knows this is Bush's and his necons' disaster, and anything that comes of it is his fault. Obama is simply smart enough not to keep dumping more good American lives after bad. Ghostwriter Ah,the favorite target of the left,neo-cons,or in this case,President Bush's advisers who are attacked because they are Jews. EarlyBird I don't have a problem with neocons being Jews, but for failing and not admitting failure. You should too, as they are working on another "victory"in Iran. Ghostwriter And,in my last statement,I was talking about YOU,EarlyBird just to clear everything up. ObamaYoMoma The most prudent policy the USA could have towards Syria is a hands off policy, while wishing and hoping at the same time that the jihad lasts for as long as possible and result in the most casualties possible to both sides of the equation as both factions are our mortal enemies. Moreover, with respect to Islam, there is no such thing as civilians, as all Muslims first and foremost must submit to the will of Allah, i.e., Sharia, and hence all Muslims are jihadists. Otherwise they are blasphemous apostates that per the dictates of Islam must be executed. Additionally, AQ style jihad, i.e., violent jihad, only makes up a tiny miniscule amount of the jihad that takes place in the world today, as the vast overwhelming amount of jihad takes place in non-violent ways and via stealth, deceit, and deception. The Obama administration’s abandonment of Iraq in its final stages of transition, leaving it to drift into the orbit of Iran, is beginning to reap enormous consequences. One of the most incompetent moves ever made in the annuls of history was GWB occupying Iraq to lift up Muslims and to democratize the Islamic world after the ouster of Saddam Hussein. Not only is Islam not a so-called "Religion of Peace" as GWB and stupid Dhimmicrats and Republicans both gullibly assume, it is in fact a very aggressive form of totalitarianism and there is no such thing as so-called "moderate Muslims." In Islam, Western style democracy and freedom are abominations that must be obliterated. Yet, GWB like an unhinged loon was actually going to democratize and transform the Islamic world and with the aid of an extremely incompetent Congress and very compliant media, he sold that garbage to the American people who stupidly swallowed that nonsense hook, line, and sinker. The truth is the mission was a failure from the get go and trying to blame it now on Obama is only an exercise in self-deception. The writer of this garbage should know better by now.
