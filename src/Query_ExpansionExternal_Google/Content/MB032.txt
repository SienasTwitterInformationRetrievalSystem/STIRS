More articles from this author: Reality Check for Younger Generation Workers How to Get an Employer’s Attention in 20 Seconds 4 Quick Ways to Improve Your Executive Resume Daphne Houston February 02, 2011 After President Obama’s State of the Union Address the other night, it should be clear to you things have changed in America. The realities of the good and bad of it as it relates to employment in general and specifically federal employment follow. There are 7 main points I’ll cover. I’ll start with the worst and work my way to the hopeful. 1. Green Jobs: Don’t expect green jobs to appear overnight. There was mention of green or clean energy initiatives and new infrastructure for roads and high speed trains. Don’t get too excited too soon. No, green jobs are not quite the next “big” thing. We have been talking green for a long time with relatively little progress. Thus, I’m skeptical because talk is cheap and gas isn’t. I attended a Green Careers and Business Summit earlier this month. There are some fascinating findings and research but you will have to educate yourself to be a viable player as these new careers emerge. There are new Green and Sustainability Degree programs and business/government partnerships springing up that are hopeful…for the future. 2. Headcount: The need for manpower will continue to decline. That means there will be fewer jobs as we know them in America, until the next really big thing comes along. And even then the need for jobs will not be as much as before. As the President stated, “With advances in technology and productivity, what used to take 1,000 people now takes 100.” I’ll add “or less.” Without proper skills the jobs of the future will be out of reach for most so really consider the skills and experience you will need for today and tomorrow. 3. Reorganization and Process Improvement: The government will be reorganizing the same way corporations restructure; as in “more often.” Think lean, mean machine. Skills they will be seeking include: Six sigma, project management, business process improvement, consulting, streamlining, strategy consulting. These are skills likely to be highly valued in government and the creator of Lean Six Sigma is already starting the push into government. That could also be good news for the over-40 job seekers who have the experience of making things happen at break neck pace from their corporate days and have a breadth and depth of experience. 4. Competition for Federal Jobs…or Any Jobs: Even with government cuts in jobs or spending there are still thousands of needs – so get going, get your federal job search in high gear and land that federal job. Even with cuts there will still be thousands of federal jobs. But the competition will get stiffer. 5. Think Global-Agencies to Keep an Eye On. Include The Department of Defense, Homeland Security, The State Department, CIA. Our focus will be on international and foreign issues as much as they will be to the issues at home. Consider opportunities to work abroad on America’s behalf. If you bring an international perspective, even better. Perhaps you speak another language, have experience in dealing with commerce, trade or exports to other countries. Your experience will be needed. 6. Veterans Services: As the war comes to an end Veterans will need your help. That means private and public sector opportunities avail to serve the thousands and their families. But it also means addressing their employment, housing and re-entry into society adjustments. It won’t be easy. 7. Education, Innovation and Research: This was the first state of the union address I’ve heard where the emphasis on The Department of Education was overwhelming. Look at the government programs for creating better schools, better teachers, better education, alternative education tracks will be expanding even more to create a force of “nation builders.” That’s what they call teachers in S. Korea. That Math or Science degree is worth a lot to you, our youth and the nation. Did you see or hear President Obama’s speech? What are your thoughts on jobs in America?

February 02, 2011 President's State of the Union 2011 Outlines Clean Energy Goals President Obama tests a Chevrolet Volt during a 2010 visit to the Detroit-Hamtramck factory where it is assembled. Credit: Pete Souza, White House Declaring that current challenges present this generation's "Sputnik moment," President Obama called for high-profile energy goals—including a target of producing 80% of U.S. electricity from clean energy sources by 2035—during his 2011 State of the Union address on January 25. To break the nation's oil dependency, the President said the United States should aim to be the first country to have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and to provide 80% of Americans access to high-speed rail within 25 years. His message stressed continued investment into science and research. "Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven't seen since the height of the Space Race," Obama said, referring to the contest that began following the launch of the Soviets' Sputnik satellite. "We'll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology—an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people." The President's budget will propose increasing clean energy technology funding by a third compared to 2010, expanding DOE's advanced research program, and doubling—from three to six—the number of DOE energy innovation hubs operating. To meet his goal of 80% clean energy by 2035, the President urged an inclusive approach. "Some folks want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, clean coal, and natural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all," he said. To attain this vision, the President's proposed budget will focus on "high-value" research into clean energy deployment, and it will include more than a doubling of investments in energy efficiency and a more than 85% increase in renewable energy investment. The White House said such expenditures will include support for the "$1 a Watt" initiative to make solar energy cost competitive; an increase in funding for 24-hour geothermal renewable energy; and more emphasis on industrial efficiency to keep U.S. manufacturing competitive. He wants a new energy efficiency initiative to catalyze private sector investment and upgrade commercial buildings. And, the Administration intends to leverage the U.S. Department of the Interior's efforts to site more renewable energy projects on public lands. Building on the progress begun in 2010 with the arrival of the Chevy Volt hybrid and the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle (EV) in showrooms, Obama said the United States should aim to have one million advanced technology vehicles on its roads in four years. To reach that goal, the Administration will propose new measures to support EV manufacturing and adoption in the United States through improved consumer rebates, investments in R&D, and competitive programs to encourage communities that invest in EV infrastructure. This effort will also tap into ongoing work to set strong fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks as well as biofuel exploration. "With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels," he said. He will also continue to push for high-speed rail as another efficient transportation option, noting that in the Midwest and California such systems are already underway. These next generation rail systems "could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car," Obama said.

January's unemployment rate fell to 9.0%. While that number offers a mixed picture of the economy, the fact remains that we are in a marathon not a sprint; recovery and jobs creation remain slow -- though steady. As President Obama noted in last week’s State of the Union address, our country’s biggest immediate challenge unquestionably remains job creation – putting Americans back to work so that the economy can grow strongly again. But with a somewhat disappointing December jobs report, it’s clear that the economy is not producing jobs quickly enough to foster sustained economic growth. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT In his State of the Union speech to the nation, President Obama stated that, "We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business." Currently, however, there are 14.5 million Americans unemployed and millions more that are under-employed. That number must come down dramatically before we can be confident in sustained economic growth.  To his credit, President Obama seems to have moved job creation up on his priority list. The appointment of Richard Daley as Chief of Staff and Jeff Immelt of GE as a key advisor, are key examples. Building on those additions, the President spent the largest portion of his State of the Union address discussing ways he and Congress can come together to create systemic change to our economy. The president and Congress however, have their work cut out for them. In order to return to a 5.6 percent unemployment rate, which was last experienced in 2007, we need to create at least 6.7 million jobs without considering population growth. To put this in perspective, we created just shy of 1.3 million private sector jobs in 2010. At that rate, it will take five years. Even if we can create jobs at three times the rate of December’s job growth (increasing from 100k to 300k jobs/month), it will take two years. And by most accounts, this is very optimistic. It’s clear why job seekers have lost confidence. While it can be argued that the stimulus likely kept the economy from a deep-dive depression or a double dip, there’s little evidence that it will be an effective stimulant for long-term job creation. There are many in the business community who rightly believe that the focus must be on the private sector. Regardless of industry or region, without a confident and motivated private sector, employers will not create jobs, at least not in America. There is an abundance of talent ready to work if given the chance. The new Congress should leave no stone unturned in considering legislation that will empower the private sector to create more American jobs, faster. In addition to what the president proposed during the State of the Union, there are three other measures that can be taken that would boost employment in the short and long term. 1. Congress should address State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) rates for employers. Over the last two years, nearly every state has increased their average SUI rates charged to employers for all employees.  While in the long term, states must fund unemployment payments to their residents, we are already seeing jobless claims decline. Instead of raising the costs for existing employees, we can let job growth at current SUI rates build back reserves. To this end, a temporary freeze should be placed on federal and state employer taxes for unemployment insurance funds. 2. Congress should immediately revise and extend the HIRE Act of 2010. The current structure that requires new employees to have been unemployed for 60 days or more does not offer an employer motivation to add jobs; rather it rewards employers that discriminate against those that are currently or have been recently employed. Companies do not make decisions to add jobs based on this current incentive; they can only make a decision to select one person over another. If the HIRE Act applied to all new hires, employers could act with certainty knowing that all new hires would enjoy the same temporary savings. 3. Finally, with regard to taxes, Congress has gone part of the way. By extending tax reductions for individuals, Congress recognized the important role that small and medium businesses in America play in job creation. By some estimates, 70% of job growth will come from small and medium businesses. This extension is necessary but not sufficient. Congress should permanently establish these tax rates. In addition, taking the next step to reduce corporate taxes will also improve the business case for larger companies to grow and hire in America, instead of incentivising them to grow their business offshore. These three simple things could go a long way to jump starting job creation in 2011. Congress has a limited window in 2011 to pass effective legislation that will spur the economic and job growth that we so badly need. Always an optimist, I hope Congress and the Administration will put partisanship aside and come together in order to enact legislation that will make a difference in the lives of all Americans, especially the 14 million Americans in search of their next job.
