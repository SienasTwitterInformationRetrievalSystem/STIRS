One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn takes that statement to its darkest place in this unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn. On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy’s diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer? As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet? With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around Stand alone or series: Stand alone How did we get this book: Bought Format (e- or p-): eBook (Kobo & Nook) Why did we read this book: It was one of our first choices for this Mystery Appreciation Week because of how much we heard about this book last year. Plus, it was reviewed EVERYWHERE and positively too making several Top Reads of 2012 Lists. **WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE, CAPS LOCK OF RAGE, AND OCCASIONAL SPOILERS (we will let you know when spoilers kick in). You have been warned.** REVIEW Thea’s Take: (There will be spoilers, but I’ll give you warning when they kick in.) I started Gone Girl knowing only these things. Gone Girl is: A. One of the bestselling books of 2012, recipient of multiple awards from critics and readers alike, across genres and categories. B. Gillian Flynn’s latest novel, with a rumored HUGE twist somewhere in its 500 pages. C. Supposedly contains a razor-wire plot, and is some kind of examination of perfection, marriage, and murder in small town, Missouri. I finished the book in less than 24 hours, compulsively turning page after page, needing to know what would happen next, who to trust, how it would all end. And, at the end, I can add one more thing to the list of things I know about this book: D. A brilliantly written and plotted mystery, a miasma of wretchedness and hate; a book that I devoured but deeply, utterly abhorred. I will try to do this as spoiler-free as possible. Gone Girl is the alternating point-of-view, semi-epistolary novel that tells two stories about Nick and Amy. In the first story, Amy met Nick in 2005 and falls in love with him. They get married. It is blissful. Amy is the Best Possible Wife, she’s funny, and smart, and beautiful, and RICH. Things start to go sour, however, when Nick loses his job, and then Amy loses her job and her money, and they move to Nick’s small hometown of Middle of Nowhere, MO, to take care of Nick’s dying mother (cancer) and father (Alzheimer’s). Amy is attentive. She is supportive. She still loves the idea of her husband, though she knows things are falling apart. Nick becomes abusive, hateful, hurtful. And then Amy disappears – just, gone without a trace. In this first story, Nick is Amy’s foil and tells his version of events, after Amy’s disappearance. In his narrative, Amy is brilliant and beautiful, but also controlling, resentful, and hateful. Their marriage is a sham. Amy’s disappearance puts Nick in the crosshairs of the police as the killer – and as the days after Amy’s disappearance pass, the evidence against Nick mounts. And then there’s the second story – and therein lie spoilers. Because everything we think we know about Amy and Nick? It’s wrong. Amy is not who we think she is, and Nick is…well, ok Nick is still douchetastically pathetic. In this second story, we learn more about this toxic couple from hell, and the pit of spite and grief that is their marriage. Like the novel’s dual plot, I’m of two minds when it comes to Gone Girl. On the one side, I can appreciate Gillian Flynn’s skill as a writer. She creates two (ok, three) characters that are completely distinct, and she alternates these points of view with incredible deftness and ease, building a complex narrative – a complex crime – that is deeply disturbing but brilliantly executed. The big “twist” is perhaps not such a twist (you kind of expect it, or you at least know that something is going to happen, that you aren’t playing with a full deck of cards), but it’s done really, really well. The first part of the book makes you question what you know about these characters, their lives and their secrets. Everyone is unreliable, everything is questionable. This is all really fucking good. But then, there’s the other side of Gone Girl: the badness, the utter RIDICULOUSNESS of certain developments, the hate that pervades the novel to its rotten-apple core. This, I did not like. I detested the characters, from the unparalleled pathetic misogynistic doucheparade that is Nick to the many different iterations of the “brilliant” Amy. I hated the way the story develops in the second part of the book, and I especially hated the way that it ends. I hated the pointlessness of the story – why does it need to be told? What does it accomplish? What does it say about us, as people? And here come the **SPOILERS** because certain things need to be SAID: Nick. I can’t really waste too much space on Nick, because he is wholly and utterly pathetic. He whines, he pretends, he is so full of incompetence and ennui and self-important horseshit. He lost his job because TEH INTERWEBS ARE EVIL. No, seriously, he’s unemployed because *whines* people don’t read REAL magazines anymore and the BLOGS are killing everything and these HACKS are destroying the printed word and he’s a REAL JOURNALIST and goddammit he’s someone IMPORTANT and why can’t anyone else understand that? He’s GORGEOUS and all the women want to jump on his disco stick, and Nick hates them all for it – women are just things to him. They are cunts, or psycho bitches, or trying too hard (these are all Nick’s words, of course). He wants to be a MAN and Amy – brilliant, beautiful, spoiled, vindictive, Amy – has stolen that from him. And then, that psycho bitch Amy fucks with Nick’s life, and Nick has to figure out how to prove his innocence because all of a sudden NICK IS THE GOOD GUY. Which brings me to Amy. It turns out that Amy is not the eager to please doormat that she presents herself as in the first part of the book. No, she is an honest to goodness sociopath that has elaborately planned and framed her cheating pathetic loser of a husband for her death. It’s not the first time, either! She’s ruined female friends, and men that have DARED to cross her/make her unhappy (by claiming RAPE, or that people are obsessed with her, and so on and so forth). Amy is brilliant and vindictive, cruel and efficient in her mastermind scheme to bring Nick DOWN. As sick as it is, I actually liked the first twist: Amy’s edge, revealed in the second part of the book, when we find out Amy is alive and that everything she’s written in the first part of the book is a lie. But then, everything starts to unravel and Amy is made out to be not only a people-hating manipulating sociopath, but a completely incompetent one, to boot – she is suckered into a relationship with her neighbors while she’s in hiding and is robbed for all her money (she only lasts for 9 days before she’s robbed! COME ON!). She BELIEVES Nick when he goes on TV and earnestly pleads for his wife to come home, so she does it just like that. Are you fucking kidding me? THESE are the actions of the same methodical, patient mind that came up with this elaborate revenge scheme against her husband? I repeat: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? She then fucks, and kills, and makes her way back into her husband’s life. She then TRAPS her husband into silence and complacence with a Miracle Baby (it’s a BOY of course!) and that makes Nick stay with her forever and always. And that is the end of Gone Girl. There are plenty of other problems, too, but Ana has covered them all, below. Frankly, I’m exhausted, and I don’t want to waste any more time or thought on this novel. I’m done writing now. Ana’s Take: (SPOILERS AHOY) Gone Girl is one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read, one that comes with an inordinate amount of hype and disguised as a “clever”, “dark”, twisterific thriller that supposedly deals with serious shit like “when a marriage go bad”. It follows the story of Nick and Amy’s marriage. It opens on the day of their fifth anniversary, the day when Amy goes missing. Soon – as these things go – the investigators start to focus on the husband. But is Nick guilty? Did he really kill his wife? If not, what happened to Amy? It’s divided in three parts and in part one, the narrative alternates between Nick’s first person narrative as he deals with Amy’s disappearance and Amy’s journal. As the plot progresses, their story is slowly revealed to the reader: Amy is a WEALTHY, BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL, COOL New Yorker whose parents write the Amazing Amy children stories. Nick is a BRILLIANT, HANDSOME journalist writing about pop culture for a magazine. Until Nick lost his job (because the INTERNET IS EVIL), Amy lost hers, and they need to move to Nick’s hometown in Missouri to take care of his sick mother. Their marriage was already shaky but it’s in Missouri that things start to really fall part between them. This part of the story is basically about Privileged White People’s Problems and both come across as entitled WANKERS – especially the aloof man-child Nick who, once his marriage starts to fall apart and money problems hit them, cheats on his wife with a much younger girl (his student). It would be a very familiar and trite story except for the fact that Amy’s journal entries start to show a different side of Nick: one that is increasingly abusive and scary. All of a sudden and in spite of Nick’s protestations, it is obvious that he is hiding something and he might after all, be guilty. Then comes part 2 and the twist: Amy knew that Nick had been cheating on her and for the past year she created this elaborate plan to disappear and frame Nick for her “killing” as vengeance. As such, her diaries entries are all faked concoctions. It becomes clear then that Amy is really, a psychopath. Parts two and three deal with Amy’s attempted revenge, Nick’s realisation of how far his wife really will go, all leading to the eventual showdown between them as Nick wants her back so he can clear his name and maybe kill her or something equally unpleasant. Gone Girl almost had me there for a while – I can vouch for how incredibly readable and engaging it is. I could not put it down and I had to find out what was going to happen to these people. I also thought that structurally speaking – with the alternating unreliable narratives – the novel was competent. It was also a success in the way that it portrayed its two deeply unpleasant, unlikeable main characters. The reader is supposed to despise these people, and loathe them I certainly did although it made for a fucking unpleasant reading experience. Plus, really, these types of “dark” characters BORE ME TO DEATH. But ok fine, this is a very personal reaction. The thing is: because the two narratives don’t exactly fit together in part one, it is obvious that at least one of them is an unreliable narrator, possibly the two. And if a reader is used to reading epistolary novels, unreliable narrators and thrillers, it is easy to know that a twist is coming. Considering all this, is the main twist even that surprising? That said, this is not my main point of contention with the novel. The recurring themes are what give me pause for thought. It is possible to argue that the one of the main themes of Gone Girl is its thoughtful examination of marriage difficulties; or to question how well two people can really know each other or allow the other to know you and, unfair expectations. The problem is: the novel cannot possibly be indicative of all marriages or a heartfelt exploration of this theme because NOT EVERYBODY IS A VINDICTIVE PSYCHOPATH OR A WHINNY MAN-CHILD WITH SOCIOPATHIC TENDENCIES. Unless you know, you want argue that one can never know who one has married because maybe, just maybe your husband/wife is planning RIGHT NOW to fake-kill themselves and frame you because you didn’t wash the dishes after dinner that one time. SO you know, BE CAREFUL. This means that the book only really works on its own microcosm of darkness. Another recurring theme throughout is the question of misogyny. Nick’s father is a deeply misogynistic character and Nick hates his father and lives under the constant fear that he too, might be misogynistic. This is really interesting in the way that it explores the difficulty in getting away from one’s upbringing. Amy on the other hand, is presented as a (kind of) feminist with her astute observations about social gender constructs by constantly calling on the bullshit of unfair social expectations around her gender. So on a cursory glance one could argue that the book is feminist. I’d argue against that. WHOLEHEARTEDLY. What else could I argue when the only obvious feminist character turns out to be a psychopath who HATES EVERY OTHER WOMAN she knows, lies about having being raped, about being stalked and eventually “traps” her husband by becoming pregnant. When the entire story is eventually contrived to show Amy as the True Villain and Nick as the one Nice Guy (despite his aloofness, his cheating, his lies and his manipulative strike) who is not REALLY a misogynist because he doesn’t hate ALL FUCKING BITCHES, he only hates his PSYCHO BITCH wife (his choice of words, not mine, by the way). He is also the one who in the end, needs to contain the psycho bitch by staying with her and helping her bringing up their child. So then all of a sudden this passive-aggressive, liar, stunted, cheater is the HERO? HAHAHA: NO. And you could argue that these PEOPLE ARE HORRID and so of course, it all makes sense. But the NARRATIVE SUPPORTS ALL THIS SHITNESS by presenting every other woman in this novel as HORRIBLE PEOPLE TOO, without nuance. Well, apart from the two obviously good characters who are sympathetic TOWARD NICK: there is this one female cop who just “knows” he must be innocent and his own twin sister who is DUH OBVIOUSLY, so perfect and of course unlike any other woman. Plus, the one guy that Amy has accused of rape turns out to be innocent because really, he is just a Nice Guy and we all know that only ALPHA GUYS are rapists. Nice Guys are NEVER RAPISTS. EVER. HAHAHA: NO. Not to mention that the book COMPLETELY lacks internal logic. The one main thread of the book, the one point that is laboriously written through the first two parts is how Amy is incredibly smart and brilliant. She has to be, in order to manipulate, concoct and maintain all the plans she has over the course of her short life. But then get this, right? Nick concocts his own plan to make Amy change her mind and come back. And his plan consists of appearing live on TV and saying that he forgives her, that he understands who she really is and he loves her anyway. That’s his plan. AND IT WORKS. Amy – psychopath, brilliant Amy – has a change of heart almost as immediately as she watches his interview. And that’s because according to Nick, Amy lacks a “bullshit detector”. BUT the first half of the book was all about setting up and making sure we understood how much of a bullshit detector Amy actually had. So which one is it? Either she is a brilliant psychopath or a gullible idiot. SHE CAN NOT BE BOTH, BOOK. And I am going to nitpick too: Nick is in his early thirties buy he sounds fucking ancient. Like the whole whinny “the internet killed my career” thing when he is at the right age to actually know how to take advantage of the Internet? Please. In summation: I devoured Gone Girl but I fucking hated it. Rating: Ana: 4 – Bad but not without some merit Thea: I have no idea how to rate this book. It is a brilliantly written book, but I hated reading it. I will abscond from a number grade, and that is all.

And yet, the book itself was so exciting from page to page, I really loved that every time I thought I had one of them figured out, I’d read on for another few pages and find out I was so completely wrong and the bad guys weren’t who I thought they were, etc. I thought it was really well executed in that sense, and like Thea said, the way the actual ‘big twist’ was written was really great. I definitely didn’t see it coming, but yeah… the ending just… still makes me mad. Xylia Brown says: February 8, 2013 at 2:52 pm I hear you. I hated everything about this book, including her writing style, but I still couldn’t wait to see what would happen next, even though most of the time that pissed me off, too. I don’t think I’ve ever been happier to reach the end of a book. And what did I get for working my way through a book that had me just flat out pissed off all the way through? An ending I hated. Jebus, I was actually mad at myself for reading it. And yet, when someone asks me if I’d recommend it, I say yes. WTF? The story, although really predictable (at least to me), was enough to keep me hurrying through chores so that I could get back to it. So, the pissed-offedness just keeps on growing, even days after I finished it. It makes me mad that, as much as I despised it, I still am forced to admit that it’s a good enough book to recommend, albeit with much gnashing of the teeth and warnings about how incandescent with rage it made me. Wendy Darling says: February 8, 2013 at 3:02 pm I read your reviews alternately laughing my ass off at your reactions and completely horrified by the contents of this much-lauded book. OH. EM. GEE. I suspected this book wasn’t going to be for me because I had very mixed reactions to this author’s first novel, which was also well-received. But then all the raves started pouring in and I got tempted again. Bad Wendy! Listen to your instincts! These people sound utterly ridiculous. I love unreliable narrators, but a successful one relies on a. FOOLING YOU in part, and it seems like some of this is isn’t entirely unexpected and b. a character whose head you actually want to be in, if not care about. Both of husband and wife sound like assholes and I am glad to rid my TBR shelf of them. Thank you for the stupendous joint review. I’ll close with a quote from it: HAHAHA: NO. eliza says: February 8, 2013 at 3:35 pm can i just thank you ladies? for stepping up and reading this book so that i don’t have to. and! for entertaining me while you convince me to never read it. thank you! Christine says: February 8, 2013 at 3:47 pm Hmm.. you know, I’m not surprised by your ratings. I haven’t yet read this one, but it is on my list of missed books from 2012 to read this year simply because I really want to see for myself if it’s worth the hype. Interestingly, most reviews and commentaries I have read from readers whom I trust have had the same reactions as the two of you. I am guessing I will feel the same, but again.. I’m curious so I’m still aiming to read it and find out for myself. Wish me luck! Liz Bourke says: February 8, 2013 at 3:54 pm I should like to second eliza’s comment. Wholeheartedly. Kendra says: February 8, 2013 at 4:33 pm I’m so glad I decided to read the spoilers before picking this one up, her books are pretty draining, and I don’t think it would have been worth it for me. I don’t know if you’d ever want to try something else by her, but I would still recommend giving Sharp Objects a try. It’s just as compulsively readable, and has a great mystery. Unlike this one though, the characters aren’t so much evil as broken, and your really feel for them. The real evil is the general culture/way of thinking in that community, and it’s portrayed really well. Also it’s a lot shorter Rachel Neumeier says: February 8, 2013 at 4:42 pm For me, there is no conceivable book where the writing, however amazing, could make up for detestable main characters and an underlying message that marriages are horrible and men are horrible and in fact people are horrible — just, no. This one is off my TBR list — and THANK YOU for the warning! Also, I’m sure hoping PANTOMIME is a winner for you, since I just bought it! KT Grant says: February 8, 2013 at 4:57 pm The ending had me going WTF WTF WTF??? This book had me by the throat because it was so f’ed up. The ending WTF?? Ruby says: February 8, 2013 at 5:11 pm Hm, bizarrely, your review makes me want to read a positive one. I want to see what people saw in it that made them love it so much, when the two of you clearly detested it. The Hipster Owl's Bookshelf says: February 8, 2013 at 5:13 pm So thanks to you lovely ladies, I never have to read this book. Ever. Because you took the time to read it for me and digest in a fucking ridiculously funny way for me. Sigh.. I love your reviews! You ladies rock!! Joel says: February 8, 2013 at 5:50 pm That was _exactly_ the reaction I had in reading the book. I can deal with an occasionally unreliable narrator (although I do prefer reliable ones); I can deal with main characters who have flaws and aren’t so appealing — put the two together and you have a mess. The ending was NOTHING — the characters didn’t grow, or improve, or anything, still trapped inside this psycho betrayal nonsense. I pity the child. AnimeJune says: February 8, 2013 at 7:00 pm I’ll chime in and say that this book, to me, was like the movie “Black Swan” – it told a fantastic story in a great way but was so viscerally unpleasant that I’d never want to watch it again. I loved the pacing and loved how the author manipulated paradigm shifts between the characters so deftly. There was a point at the end where I found myself feeling sorry for the husband and I had to pull myself out of there and realize the reason I kind of liked him at the end was because SURE, HE’S AN ASSHOLE, BUT AT LEAST HE’S NOT A TOTAL SOCIOPATHIC MONSTER ASSHOLE LIKE HIS WIFE. Yeah, I can’t say I regret reading it, because it was an exciting experience, but it wouldn’t be a book I’d want to reread. Lorena says: February 9, 2013 at 1:18 am Thank you ladies, great reviews! I agree with you except for the fact that the first part for me was simply booooring. I hated Amy in every possible way, amazing and psyco! For me it was a waste of time. But I like it whe I see reviews like this so I don’t feel alone… Every review was sooo good gggrrrrrr! Sadly it was an E-book so I couldn’t slap the walls with it and feel better while reading it. Lisa the Nerd says: February 9, 2013 at 7:25 pm “In summation: I devoured Gone Girl but I fucking hated it.” That summation rules. Molly says: February 10, 2013 at 10:54 am Huge congrats on a job well done! I reviewed Gone Girl and could only manage to articulate one tenth of what I felt about it yet you have managed to sum it all up perfectly! When I finished reading it I wanted to throw it against a wall and not retrieve it, yet I couldn’t deny it’s a very clever book. But that doesn’t mean I have to like it! My review of Gone Girl Naomi_Sian says: February 10, 2013 at 12:15 pm Wow, I’m the first dissenter. There’s a lot wrong with this book, no doubt about it, but I really enjoyed it. I liked the end because it was so dark (shades of Rosmary’s Baby, I think). Plus, even while Amy’s rapid failure in the woods made me go, “Eh, what?” in retrospect I think it makes sense. Amy’s a narcissist. She thinks she’s brilliant, and she is, but she’s not perfect. She’s a fantastic planner – come on, she spent a YEAR setting up this scam – but she can’t improvise for toffee. This is the first time she’s had to leave her priviledged world and mix with people she doesn’t know or understand, and can’t manipulate. Rather than face up to how badly she’s failed – and she can’t do that after all, she’s a narcissist – she justifies returning to her old, safe world where she can wrap everyone around her little finger. Where she can be Amazing Amy and get all of the praise she *deserves*. Besides, what sort of audience does she have in the woods? And I reckon, rather than hating women per se, she just hates anyone who threatens to take the spotlight off her. So I think I get Amy. But Nick? Much more muddled, difficult-to-understand character. I think he suffers from Flynn trying to misdirect readers through his narrative. But he is a total, total tool; I’m not arguing there. Here ends the Wall of Text. Sorry folks. Barry Dixon says: February 10, 2013 at 1:43 pm You are aware this is a thriller novel, right? It’s not supposed to be a feminist tract. KT Grant says: February 10, 2013 at 1:45 pm Barry, can you give us examples in this review where you feel a feminist tract has been stated? Barry Dixon says: February 10, 2013 at 2:05 pm The 3 paragraphs following “another recurring theme…” Also I’m interested in the assumption that a good novel has to feature people that you ‘like’. Is Nick the ‘hero’. It seems that the argument is if Nick has bad qualities, then the book is judged a failure. Strange. I’m intrigued also by the number of people who have not read the book, but agree completely with the review. Particularly ironic, seeing as one of the main themes of the book is ‘trial by public opinion’ KT Grant says: February 10, 2013 at 2:15 pm Most people connect with a story because they like the characters. For some readers, that is a must. Since Nick and Amy are delusional and not nice at all, some readers will have a hard time connecting with the story because of that. Gone Girl was one of my favorite books of 2012 because of the writing and how it grabbed me. Reading is a very selective thing. But a review, like the one here, which I feel states perfectly why Ana didn’t like Gone Girl, could help people determine if this book should interest them. The same goes for reviews that praise books. People will reader books based on their peers’ opinions. Ana makes a good case why she didn’t like both Nick and Amy equally. I thought Nick was a sad sack and easily manipulated, while Amy was just psychotic and able to manipulate others which she does with her ex-boyfriend who’s obsessed with her, her parents and even Nick who although isn’t willing to forgive her, let’s her get away with everything because of the events of the end which is beyond disturbing within itself. Terry Potter says: February 10, 2013 at 2:33 pm I’m soooo glad I read the reviews! I hate wasting my time on a stupid book when there are so many good ones to read. Really doesn’t sound like anyone liked it. Now I can move on to something interesting without feeling guilty that I didn’t read this one for BOOK CLUB! Oh heavens. Barry Dixon says: February 10, 2013 at 3:32 pm ‘beyond disturbing’ KT? Well yes, quite! That’s intentional. It means the book has done its job. Somebody should also say that the plot is gripping, clever, original and watertight, and the writing is witty and observant. The reviewers seem to have a problem with the actions of Amy (a fictional psychopath) but whether or not you ‘buy’ how she acts in the second half (I personally didn’t have an issue, Flynn sold it for me) there are no logical problems with the plot. If pushed I would concede there are a couple of fortunate coincidences crow-barred in but nothing beyond the realms of reason. I guess I’m alone in not actually hating Nick, who I think is a very realistically human character, so I’m not going to try to fight that lost cause. I loved ‘Gone Girl’. Sarah N. says: February 10, 2013 at 4:36 pm Barry, I wouldn’t call the writing witty and observant nor the plot watertight. Amy makes some valid observations about real double standards that exist in the world, but her observations are undermined by the fact it turns out she is an utter pyschopath. Nick mostly spouts sexist tripe. I personally like my books feminist, thank you very much, even my trillers. You are right in some ways though. It is a gripping novel. It is creative. Flynn is a good writer. That’s part of what I found so disappointing about Gone Girl. It is written by a competent writer. I wish I found it disturbing. To me, it was just a pathetic story about a pathetic man who is wronged by an evil, evil woman. There was potential there, but to me, it came off as shallow despite the flashes of creativity in it. Ruby says: February 10, 2013 at 4:45 pm I’ve never read Gone Girl and I never intend to (and didn’t even before reading this review), but I think, Barry, that you’re missing the point. This is Anna and Thea’s joint review of the book and, therefore, by definition, their opinion of it. We all take different things from what we read and the quality of a book is completely subjective. What I’m trying to say is that what worked for you didn’t work for Ana and Thea. Just because your opinions differ doesn’t mean that one is less valid. Barry Dixon says: February 10, 2013 at 11:41 pm Sarah, the points we disagree on are those that can truly be said to be a matter of opinion I think. I don’t belive a thriller needs to have a laudable social agenda… it’s all about whether the reader feels compelled to find out what happens next. I’d like to know where you think the plot has holes. You may be right, but I didn’t spot them! Ruby, what can I say? You haven’t read the book, but I’m wrong in disagreeing with the reviewers? If the quality of a book is ‘entirely subjective’ then you should absolutely stop reading other peoples opinions of them! Ana says: February 11, 2013 at 2:42 am I don’t belive a thriller needs to have a laudable social agenda Barry, I am not sure I understand what is your point when you mention “social agendas” or “feminist tract” – are these supposed to be bad things? Are we supposed to read books as “just books” and in this case accept Gone Girl as “just a thriller” and as long as it is a page turner then it’s all good? But how about the fact that the story ITSELF brings up the issues of feminism, misogyny and sexism? This is actually a THEME in the novel. Isn’t then the book itself subscribing to what you call a “social agenda”? The point being: we took issue with how these ideas where incorporated into the novel – to us, they were undermined by how the story supported Nick and not Amy. In any case, we do attempt to actually engage with the books we read and go beyond a mere surface reading. Sexism, feminism, bigotry ARE issues we think important and if believing that equality is a good thing and if hoping to read books in which half of the world’s population are not portrayed in a sexist way is to have a “social agenda” so be it. This thoughtful engagement with stories may not be what you are looking for in your reading though. Fair enough. May I just suggest then that this blog and our reviews are not the best forum for you? Barry Dixon says: February 11, 2013 at 3:45 am Hmm, it seems that if I don’t agree with your opinion then I’m obviously just reading at a simplistic surface level and politely asked to go away. My point is that, yes sexism is one theme in the book (for example Nicks’ fathers’ misogyny), but it’s not the only one. You don’t mention the theme of ‘trial by media’ which would seem to be far more the focus of the novel. And for some reason, one that I’m not clear on at all, you just dismiss his sister and the female detective as… Well I’m not sure why you dismiss them. You are just snarky about them as they do not support your argument. I’m not saying that thrillers should not take issues such as sexism etc seriously… Just that it is not the sole over-riding aim of it. There’s one black character that I can remember, the duped male detective. Does that make it racist? The main character is psychotic…. Does that mean that this novel is offensive to those living with mental disabilities? I don’t think so… A thriller by its very nature is about people doing bad things, and other peoples efforts to thwart them. It doesn’t make me a sexist simpleton to identify that. Still, I’ll go away if you just come right out and say it! Barry Dixon says: February 11, 2013 at 4:16 am Douche count among the main characters: Nick : douche Amys dad : douche Amys mum : douche Nicks dad : douche Male detective : douche Male and female transients : douches Female interviewer #1 : douche and no #2 : Not douche Female detective : Not douche Go, Nicks’ sister : Not douche Amys victims and their families: variously douche and Not douche. Call it even. Nicks’ lawyer : Not douche… Or douche? Margin call Nicks’ student : arguable Amy : Pyscho! My point? On the whole this book has a range of douche and non-douche characters irrespective of gender. Issues of sexism are bought up…. And answered. Does the ‘hero’ that you have such an issue with get off scott free? Does he hell -he gets to be punished every day. I think I wrote ‘douche’ too often in this post. Ana says: February 11, 2013 at 4:34 am You will probably notice how there are other dissenting views on this thread but none of them dismissed our review out of hand by simply stating: “You are aware this is a thriller novel, right? It’s not supposed to be a feminist tract”. I find it very interesting that out of the thousands of words in the review, you are indeed concentrating your arguments on the couple of paragraphs that address sexism. “A thriller by its very nature is about people doing bad things, and other peoples efforts to thwart them” . Isn’t that a very simplistic and reductionist view though? Stories are not written to a historical vacuum not to mention that this one in particular addresses these themes directly. I am not the one who is dismissing the characters of the Cop and Go, it’s the story itself that does so by portraying then as merely accessories to Nick’s arc. As you mentioned above they are two the few non-douchey characters and they have no purpose in the story other than to be there for Nick. As for Nick getting scot free –he might be stuck with Amy but he does get scot free in the way that the story ends up supporting him. He ends up being the “hero”, the one readers end up pitying because who could possibly support a psychotic, murderous character like Amy? Even the way you have framed your point as HIM getting to be punished every day: poor Nick is stuck to AMY and not they are stuck to EACH OTHER. Anonymous says: February 11, 2013 at 5:32 am I think the reason we disagree is because we had different expectations going into the book. You expect a “thoughtful examination of marriage difficulties”…but it isn’t that. It annoys you enough, in fact, to press Caps Lock. You’re right. It isn’t. Similarly, “Silence of the Lambs” is not about psychiatric care in the US. (Two MALE psychos in that one… should I be offended?) I think the fuzzy area is.. “nice” Amy – her diary – makes some good valid points about sexism. So when she turns out to be the villain in the second half you feel betrayed. Actually – let me put that as a question – is that the problem for you ? Anyway, the fact that she turns out to be the villain does not necessarily negate all the more subtle points she makes in the first half. But… the sane, reasonable “nice” Amy is a ruse ! Amy is a scheming, sociopathic, megalomaniac who understands what sane, rational balanced people want to hear and she tells them that story. So, yes, it’s not balanced between Nick and Amy at the end because … caps lock… AMY IS THE VILLAIN OF THIS NOVEL. Does this make Nick the hero ? Not necessarily…But it does make him NOT THE VILLAIN OF THIS NOVEL. As for the implication that my post was rude or dismissive in some way, you start by calling this novel “one of most ridiculous books I have ever read” (really ? Come on now) and you conclude by saying “I fucking hated it”. How’s that for rude and dismissive ? Stephanie says: February 11, 2013 at 6:21 am I also appreciate the author’s obvious skill, but I had to put it down several times for either being too depressing, or totally out there. Mixed feelings on it overall, and I’m careful who I recommend it to. Rachel Neumeier says: February 11, 2013 at 6:33 am An interesting comment thread! A few more comments of my own, though maybe Ana and Thea are really ready to let this thread die a natural death? But still: 1. Saying a book is ridiculous might be dismissive. Saying you “fucking hated it” obviously is just a statement of your reaction to it and has nothing to do with whether you also find it worth dismissing. If Thea and Ana had merely dismissed GONE GIRL, they wouldn’t have been cap locking their rage, they would just have said “meh” and moved on. 2. In a thriller, generally the people trying to stop the coming disaster are NOT sick evil psycho bastards. They are the good guys. 3. Nothing will make me like a book that contains nothing but bad guys and a few minor incompetent good guys. That is why I appreciate a review that lets me avoid a book where this is the case. I don’t have to read the book myself in order to conclude that I would detest it. That’s what reviews are FOR. Barry Dixon says: February 11, 2013 at 7:51 am Apologies for swearing in my last post. Even though it was a quote it was un-necessary. Also, none of my comments are intended as a personal attack… I just really really liked the book, and I saw very little defense of it here. Rachel, I would say that reviews do serve the purpose of informing people of what they are likely to enjoy (although I’d hope that people remain slightly more open-minded than to only read what they know they like ALL the time), but reviews also exist to analyse, critique and discuss, and that can only be done by those who have read the book. I suspect Ana snd Thea would agree. But I can’t be sure! Rachel Neumeier says: February 11, 2013 at 9:13 am “…but reviews also exist to analyse, critique and discuss, and that can only be done by those who have read the book.” A good review will certainly analyze and critique a book – which this one did, in spades. But though a review may certainly spark a discussion, I don’t agree that that is in any way the purpose of a review. That is the purpose of book discussion groups, in which, yes, everyone must obviously read the book in order to have an opinion about it. The fundamental function of reviews is to provide a clear opinion so as to guide others toward or away from the book WITHOUT them having to read it. I myself am totally uninterested in analyzing or critiquing this particular book, because life’s too short to read books I loath. Also, I should add, no one needs to have read this particular book in order to have an opinion on broader topics such as sexism in fiction. And it’s perfectly appropriate for a reviewer to provide their take on whatever issues they find problematic in a book. In fact, it’s kind of a requirement for a personal review to provide personal opinions! Barry Dixon says: February 11, 2013 at 10:11 am ok. Reviews are not up for discussion. Got it. Seriously, I partially agree with your last point. But here’s the thing. Ana thinks the book is not feminst. I agree, but so what? Other potential readers seem to have the opinion this means the book is sexist. Well I disagree with that, but hey that’s ok. It’s ok to respectfully disagree you know. Sexism is bad. I get it. Should you read a book with sexist characters? Ana would say “no” (I think) , I would say why not, I’m not a baby, right? But also there’s the question of whether the book itself condones a sexist message. We’re all against that, is that a given? This book is not sexist. That’s my opinion, obviously. The ticket to having an opinion is to read the book. If you don’t read it, fine, but you don’t get to say who is right and who is wrong. Sorry! I’ll stop now! #cheers erupt throughout the compound# Nicole says: February 11, 2013 at 11:00 am Favorited because you expressed my emotions about this novel so well. Nicole says: February 11, 2013 at 11:00 am Favorited because you expressed my emotions about this novel so well. Rachel Neumeier says: February 11, 2013 at 11:21 am Um, hello? Of course a review can be discussed. That is not the same thing as conflating reader responses to a review with reader reactions to a book, nor the purpose of a review with the purpose of a discussion group, both of which I think have happened here. And I have no idea whether I would think that GONE GIRLS is sexist, if I read it. I’m not quite sure why this comment thread wandered into this sexism-yes-no debate, in which it appears to be stuck as though in the La Brea tar pits. This issue did not actually comprise the main part of the review, and in any case I actually don’t much care about that. It’s the lack of good guy characters and underlying message that everyone is horrible and relationships are horrible that takes it off my list. I don’t need to read the book to know that this would make it a DNF for me. THAT is the main function of a review (other than pure entertainment): to guide potential readers towards or away from a book, BEFORE they read the book. Rachel Neumeier says: February 11, 2013 at 11:22 am Done now! Cassie B. says: February 11, 2013 at 12:36 pm Never read Gone Girls, but I thought the review did in fact point out positive qualities as well as negative ones. All many people ask of a book is that it be impossible to put down; here we have that kind of book. Now that I know that, I might actually read it just to see what all the fuss is about. “Should you read a book with sexist characters? Ana would say no (I think)…” — Kind of rude to put words in her mouth, especially since I don’t think this was implied in the review anywhere. But at least you modified it. There’s a huge difference in a book that happens to have sexist/racist/homophobic/psychotic/murderous characters and a book that doesn’t present these qualities as negative traits. Anyway, thanks for the review guys! Ana says: February 12, 2013 at 1:56 am Thanks for the great discussion so far, everybody. Pearce says: February 13, 2013 at 11:02 pm I had some problems with this book, but you’ve both made a pretty major error in your reading of it – specifically about why Amy comes back at the end. She doesn’t come back because she’s gullible enough to believe Nick. She comes back because she now knows that he can still pretend to be the person she wants him to be. She’s an unreliable narrator, but I think we can believe this bit: The man he was pretending to be – women love that guy. I love that guy. That’s the man I want for my husband. That’s the man I signed up for. That’s the man I deserve. So he can choose to truly love me the way he once did, or I will bring him to heel and make him be the man I married. My own problem with the book is that Amy behaves in exactly the way that real-world victims of sexual abuse are constantly, and unjustly, accused of. That bothers me quite a bit. Apart from that (and I think that it’s okay to like problematic fiction, provided you’re willing to acknowledge the problems) I thoroughly enjoyed Gone Girl. I actually thought it was very funny throughout – something nobody here seems to have noticed. I have no problem reading books about unlikeable characters doing horrible things – from Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus and Richard III to Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley books, I’ve often been delighted by fictional people behaving very, very badly. (Another reason that it’s okay to like problematic narratives: in fiction, nobody gets hurt for real.) Fi says: February 14, 2013 at 12:18 am Can I just say, thank you. I thought I was going crazy because so many people loved this book and I can’t stand it. I was beginning to think I had missed something entirely. Book Review: Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Sáenz | The Book Smugglers says: February 14, 2013 at 4:42 am [...] Joint Review: Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn [...] Tania Stanwood says: February 20, 2013 at 11:28 am Reading these comments is quite comical! I read Gone Girl, I wasn’t taken at all by it. Everybody said to read it, I fell into the trap and was not happy about it. I will stick to books that I come across on my own or have better reviews over all! I am really into a good Thriller at the moment, Blood Land by R.S. Guthrie, now here’s a good story that I hope ends well! rsguthrie.com of anyone needs a great read to add to their tbr lists! Anything I think at this point is better than Gone Girl! Thanks for the review, and these comments are golden! Daniel Abraham says: February 27, 2013 at 10:26 pm I just finished the book, and I’d been putting off reading the review until I finished it. I think it’s fascinating that both of y’all both loathed it and found it compulsively readable. Makes me want to go back and see what it was about the prose that carried you through so well despite not being at all consonant with the story. L says: March 3, 2013 at 2:51 pm That this book stands as best selling writing and story telling is a sad commentary on the taste and intellect of the American public. Elizabeth says: March 3, 2013 at 9:04 pm A good book, in general, has: - brilliant, well-thought out structure - flawed, realistic characters/relationships - an overarching message to portray If we were to apply the extraordinary writing skill, that even the least impressed of reviewers agree makes it interesting (and evidently provocative enough to think about), to the formulaic skeleton above of what a good book is, we have an excellent book. Despite this, to be fair to the article and its comments, I agree with some things said, and would like to add that the realism of the police department could have been embellished, perhaps. For example, Amy could have been the recipient of questioning that made the reader feel she truly was “nearly” caught. The police seem to act as part of the narrative towards the end that simply releases Amy back into freedom, with only Boney being suspicious. This is the part of the book I felt was underdeveloped – however, nothing more than a trivial problem, seeing as I am not reading believing this to focus on the detective/police department facts. However, on the subject of Boney, she is, I think, with her intellect and sharp intuition in comparison to her companion (who it must be noted makes derogatory remarks about underwear found in Nick’s office), perhaps where the feminist reading really takes place, should you be looking for it. She is very easy to relate to as a woman of strength, as we feel her sense of injustice intensely. Despite where the plot may take her into ‘losing’ to Amy in the end, we know, as Nick says in the last line, that the worst thing would be, in fact, to be Amy. All things considered, I believe this book is extremely worthy of praise. Aside from the unnecessary amount of time and effort gone into making this derogatory review seem “funny” (I have laughed aloud before at reviews I don’t agree with, but this sense of humour is tragic – regardless), I was quite alarmed by the fact that the comments have shown reviewers who have been immediately put off, thus don’t want to buy the book anymore. I’m not sure why there is so much anger towards Flynn, because despite agreeing with some points made, the book is thought-provoking, and I think it has just been misunderstood, perhaps, to be a thoroughly feminist text. This comment isn’t supposed to offend anyone, but hopefully it serves the purpose to recommend highly the book to anybody who has read the above article and is put off by negativity. Awesome book. Joanne says: March 3, 2013 at 10:38 pm I just finished Gone Girl and like many others I said WTF at the “ending”. I thought I skipped a chapter and made sure that was the end?? I feel duped. There Was No Ending! Good until then, but now I will not read her other books… kathy says: March 5, 2013 at 11:31 pm Seriously, cannot believe all the negative comments I just read here. I read the book which came highly recommended to me and loved it! Couldn’t put it down. You know sometimes a book is just a book and should be enjoyed for what it is and not over-thought so much. In my humble opinion, Gone Girl is totally entertaining, pathologically disturbing, funny as hell, and full of twists and turns. I have and will continue to recommend this book to anyone who loves a great story! andrea says: March 21, 2013 at 4:15 pm I just lost, and will never get back, two days of my life to this stupid book (not to mention the financial outlay). I had to wonder why I found it just so disappointing after listening to and reading glowing reviews. Thanks for affirming I’m not odd in finding it such a completely annoying waste of time and money. Judy says: March 23, 2013 at 3:45 am Like Andrea I am grateful to Thea for affirming that I am not the only one who found this book far overrated. The beginning sucked me in and I thought I was in for a great read but then Part II happened. Once you knew the type of people both Amy and Nick were the story was just plain boring and predictable. I don’t know how it got all the rave reviews. Mike W says: March 28, 2013 at 2:40 pm I could totally live with this book, and all the problems mentioned by others except for one thing: The terrible ending. Jeez, throw us a bone. Have him kill her, or her kill him. Have her arrested, but please just do SOMETHING other than “My wife’s pregnant now, I won’t have you investigating her further.” (And living “happily” ever after…) The lack of closure in the book ruined it for me. Otherwise, it had me hooked, waiting to see how it would end. Cervenka says: March 30, 2013 at 6:01 am It reassures me every time I see a well-written negative review of this book. I was looking forward to reading it so much, and then once I actually started reading it, I hated it. Just because a book is well-written doesn’t mean it’s worth reading. I don’t understand what so many people see in it. I thought it was awful. Omar says: April 1, 2013 at 8:50 pm I just can NOT understand how in the world such a nasty story can be so popular and overrated, the characters are detestable, completely odious. I did not finished it because I got to a point when I couldn’t stand one more page and threw it away, but what I read, I think was absolutely a waste of time, full of immorality and a lot lot of pointless evil and sinfulness. This is one of the worst books I’ve ever had in my hands. Combs says: April 6, 2013 at 10:03 pm Okay, look the only reason why her “bullshit detector” …short circuited…(?) was because of her overpowering ego. She didn’t see a lie because she didn’t want to. She wasn’t a robot, she was a FEMALE and she was in an uncomfortable situation she quite literally only saw what she wanted to see. She was unhappy with Nick, therefore she was more likely to notice he was cheating and more intelligent. But she was unhappy with her new trailer park/human pet life style and kinda missed her old life she decided she wanted back in and jumped at the first bone she was thrown. I have much more to say on this book but I don’t have the energy. Claire says: April 8, 2013 at 4:02 pm I enjoyed this joint review, particularly that it appeared to be written by the three iterations of Amy. I particularly identified with the second review: the it’s a clever book but aaaaargh I didn’t enjoy it. Grudging respect for an author’s sleight of hand does not an enjoyable reading exoerience make. Can I just say, I think it was clear that Amy went back to Nick because of his ability to say the things she wanted to hear – ergo, the knowledge of what those things actually were. Having resentfully appeared to be someone she isn’t to please others, she appears to be satisfied with Nicks being forced to do the same. Which to me is the most despairing part of the book. Boo :-(. Elyse says: April 12, 2013 at 1:40 am I hated the book. The marriage was toxic, the plot predictable, and the fact the book ends with this uninteresting and selfish couple having a baby, made me really scratch my head. If I didn’t need to read it for my book club, I would have dropped it 10 pages in. Julia says: April 24, 2013 at 2:51 pm I COMPLETELY agree with Thea! I was really excited to read this book; I had heard so many good things about it. And then I started the book. The first half bored me to death, the only reason I kept reading was to see whether Amy was alive or not. The beginning of the second half was ok, the “twist” (that really wasn’t much of a twist) had me interested for a few chapters, but then I began to dislike every character altogether. I am baffled by then critical acclaim this book is gettin, although I do have to hand to Gillian Flynn for weaving together all the details of a very complicated story. Other than that, just no. Tanya says: April 25, 2013 at 10:42 am I believe people that read or heard “glowing reviews” and high praise had super high expectations and with most high expectations you are always let down because your dream is bigger than the reality. I had seen this sitting on a few coffee tables in a few homes and read the description once before reading it. In fact I had forgotten what it was all about by the time I got around to reading it and hadn’t heard or read any comments. So I got to enjoy this book free of anyone’s opinions but my own. Are there flaws? Sure. Not enough to kill the enjoyment of the book for me though. While most, even those that loved the book, hated the ending I actually couldn’t see it ending any other way. Amy is smart and a psycho but this is what she wanted ultimately. Whether it is true or not she wanted Nick’s love and company even if it’s all built on a lie. Everything about her is built on a lie so she has no problem with that as long as it fits into what she wants. The chick is bonkers but she still wanted Nick in her life treating her sweetly no matter what, even if it’s forced. I don’t think she was gullible but she heard the words he said and was willing to come back knowing that she could keep him with her and keep him pretending it was all true. If someone bought me a house because I guilted and manipulated them in to buying me a house I would still enjoy the house. And as far as Nick saying Amy has no bullshit detector I think really it’s that Nick doesn’t have one. Amy does just fine with knowing what the truth is but she chooses to ignore things so she can have her loco perfect scenario. Iggy says: May 1, 2013 at 10:49 am I have a question for English speakers, as I’ve read the book in spanish. Has the title an intentional double meaning? I’ve seen in internet that “gone” has the slang meaning of infatuated, in love (to be gone on somebody) and that meaning suits perfectly in a somewhat ironically way. Is that expression common and understood nowadays? And I also saw gone means pregnant btw. Scott Pilgrim says: May 2, 2013 at 8:42 pm I kind of liked this book in the beginning but it started to drag on towards the middle. I wasn’t a fan at all of the ending! Elyse says: May 2, 2013 at 9:58 pm The “heroine” of this book is a sociopath. Fake a kidnapping. Kill an old boyfriend to hide the deception. A spineless, wimpy husband. And this most “delightful” couple stay together and have a baby. Why is this on a best seller list? I didn’t like anyone in the book, the plot was vicious, the heroine twisted. What did I miss? Is this the best American literature has to offer? Is this what it takes to become a best seller? This book stinks. This is not enjoyment The author should undergo a psychiatric eval! To quote Mr. Ebert “two thumbs down.” . Pearce says: May 2, 2013 at 11:36 pm the plot was vicious, the heroine twisted But that’s exactly why I liked it! clair says: June 5, 2013 at 3:33 pm Amy didn’t intend to go back to Nick and she wasn’t taken in by his appearances on TV saying that he forgave her. She returned to him because she had little option, nowhere to go and no money after she was robbed and Desi kind of imprisoned her. Of course killing Desi was despicable but in her eyes he was dispensable. I actually liked the ending and the way that she trapped him. Any normal man would have insisted on a divorce (child or no child) but I didn’t think that either of them deserved a happy ending so they sort of deserved each other. Susan says: June 10, 2013 at 10:32 am I hated the end of this book! I’ll not read another of her books! Wasted my time!! Laura says: June 14, 2013 at 3:58 pm The ending is what drove me to look for reviews. the ending was. horrible. i was actually angry. This ending was horrible. what she tricked him into a baby and oh that’s fine but you are still a psycho? i went back flipping through pages thinking i missed something. I kept clicking the “forward” button – that can’t be the end! Makes the rest of what I read a waste. no consequence, except maybe for Nick in having to live with her. Ugh – just want to foreget. Ron Strickland says: June 15, 2013 at 4:21 pm Gone Girl is an appalling waste of readers’ time. The characters are odious, and the plot is to be avoided at all costs. The author should pay compensation to everyone who suffered from contact with this stinkeroo! nancy says: June 25, 2013 at 1:23 pm What a waste of time! I found myself looking for someone to root for…it was as if we, the readers, were not meant to find any redeeming quality in anyone. By a narrow interpretation, Margo could have been redemptive had her character been a little more fleshed out. Same could be said of Boney. Why was there no protagonist? Nick relied on Margo and Amy was jealous of their relationship. Nick was almost more frustrating than Amy because at least she had mental issues, (not an excuse, I’m just saying.) That we are the product of our upbringing seems to be the takeaway, but I really found the book unsettling, unsatisfying and leaving a void. I’m almost afraid to start another book, for fear of being dragged as I was along this journey. And that’s very sad. Marie Gagliardi says: June 29, 2013 at 7:01 pm This book needs a sequel so that we can find out how “bad seed” Amy raises Rosemary’s Baby. Alexa says: July 18, 2013 at 6:03 pm Late to the party, but so glad you wrote your reviews. I finally read Gone Girl, and was disappointed. I was expecting the BIG TWIST, which turned out to not be as big as I’d expected. I did think Amy was a brilliantly drawn sociopath, and I was duly impressed with Flynn’s ability to craft three completely distinct voices. From a technical standpoint, I’m in awe of her writing. But, man, so much of it bothered me. Everyone was beautiful and brilliant (gag). Everyone is an asshole. All the shit about ugly, boring people. THE FAKE RAPE OMG RAGING. Amy hating allllll the women. The misogyny stuck to my skin like a film and I’m still feeling pretty gross about it, 24 hours later. The rape thing is one of the worst: way to add to the “psycho bitches be lying to punish men” narrative, Flynn. Way to go. Hated it too says: July 21, 2013 at 3:01 pm I just finished his godforsaken book and needed to find at least one person who also thought this book was a crock of shit, contrived and painful to read (especially the passages of Amy’s diary- utterly annoying and not believable). Agree w everything Ana said, especially the disturbing portrayal of female characters- I need a cleanser book, I appreciate a recommendation- from you I’d take it! Alex says: July 29, 2013 at 2:52 pm I just finished this book. One full day of my life wasted, after such anticipation based on friends’ own reading experiences. HOW CAN A BOOK POSSIBLY BE SO RIDICULOUSLY OVERWROUGHT WITH STUPIDITY? I mean, the predictability! the laughable “sociopathy”! the positively , inhumanely HORRIBLE affected speech of the idiot saveur to Amy, the single worst contrived ending of any book…possibly ever (on the NYT best sellers list). There was no way to end this book with a measure of respect after the neighbors-stole-my-money scene. UGGGGGGGGGGGH! I HATE when a “good book” turned out to be so maddeningly fucking wholly fucking stupid. Mary Ellen says: July 30, 2013 at 9:47 pm Thanks for the review. Really…thank you both! This book was vile. I thought because of the reviews I’d have a thriller on par with Silence of the lambs. Not so much, I almost threw the book out after 15 pages. The 1st part was poorly written even for quickie pulp. The middle story was icky, predictable but a page turner in a sick way, & better writing. The last part made my stomach turn. I hated all the characters. The ending was ludicrous, what made it worse was she had so many options for different twists in the story that would have worked and lead to her desired “sequel”. She took similar real life crimes & obvious real life tv personalities, & tv shows & mixed them in a blender. It was predictable, at times boring – I skimmed some parts – I knew what she’d write, every 3rd word would do. I have never wanted to burn a book, This one I did, but I didn’t, instead I dropped it off for a fan of this crap to purchase at the Goodwill for a few bucks, lessening the carbon footprint of bad books by one. Some people really are abused, raped & stalked, she exploited that. She has her nice pile of money, a writer writes what they know, she knows pop culture. She fed off the national sensationalism that’s current. I’m surprised she hasn’t been sued for stealing parts of peoples lives (Nancy Grace, Oprah? Scott Peterson? Or any other person who killed their spouse). There was no “there” there. Thankfully, her characters are so flimsy as to be forgotten in moments. I read everything from Kafka, Tolstoy to teen fiction like The Hunger Games, which always had me turning pages even though it’s for teens, not that well written, but satisfying enough in the turn of events (for me in my forties). Anna Karenina had the worst ending ever until now, – I hated all the characters but 2 & it was well written, same with Crime & Punishment – which had a philosophical point. Geez a waste of time & I rarely think that about a book, even bad ones. “Gone Girl” was Gone from my home within an hour of my finishing it. Yuk! Thanks for a place to vent! haleema says: August 15, 2013 at 10:01 am i agree with 90% of the people here, it was a waste of time! It is the most stupid book i have ever read!!!!!! Do yourself a favor and don’t read it. Grace O Donnell says: August 17, 2013 at 5:58 pm Glad to see the above reviews! I expected a fantastic read from beginning !! It lost me valuable time on hols I was disguised by the ending readers were cheated !! Rubbish book Abigail says: September 10, 2013 at 10:48 am I thought both of these reviews were well-written opinions, and I enjoyed reading them both. Ana, I don’t like your constant capitalization of your main points. It distracts me from your clever analysis. I intend to read more of your reviews, and thank you for posting. Diane says: September 10, 2013 at 4:37 pm What about the writing? She uses 25 words when 10 will do. Like someone who likes to hear themselves talk. I am re-writing it (properly) as I’m reading! Gen says: October 14, 2013 at 3:30 pm It’s true, there are NO well-crafted, multifaceted female characters. Amy’s literally mentally ill (psycho bitch who fakes rape and fakes a pregnancy then actually uses pregnancy to trap a man,whining about all the ways women are exploited then taking advantage of the same culture to manipulate everyone around her). Go doesn’t have any depth beyond being a cioher/foil/support for Nick. The ‘good’ female cop is intuitive and sassy yet incompetent and one-note (mixing up cop and girl stereotypes). Etc etc. But none of the males have any depth either. Please. Nick is a habitual liar, a cheater with daddy issues, a self-absorbed douchebag who always thinks he’s better than THAT guy, a whiner who keeps calling amy pscho, and yet he stays with said psycho becauseshe makes him a better man, plus the baby (a SON!). The lawyer is your cliched scumbag lawyer, Desi is a creepy obsessive stalker, Nick’s father is your run-of-the-mill asshole who thinks all women be bitches. Etc etc The novel is many tertible things, but it is less misogynist than just plain warped in its view of human nature. S. says: October 21, 2013 at 3:24 pm I found the book more enjoyable than these reviewers, but agree that Amy’s motivation and characterization was wildly inconsistent. She’s brilliant and has “thought of everything,” but lets herself be robbed of all her cash? Couldn’t she have left the cash somewhere safe, such as in the car…. or fled the cabin complex the moment she sensed anything strange? And I also scratched my head that Nick’s obviously fake pleas for her to return convinced her in any way. That rang totally false to me. With respect to Ana’s review: With spell check built into pretty much every e-mail and word processing program, I’m surprised that there were so many typos. It’s “whiny,” not “whinny” (which is the sound that a horse makes). But I still enjoyed the vitriol of the review! Susan says: October 24, 2013 at 6:59 pm I really did not like this book – at all! Could not get past page 75. Flynn comes across as a real amateur to me – obsessed with how her cutesy, clever words sound to herself, instead of being able to build an engaging suspenseful story. She has that beginner-level “Look, Ma, I’m a writer!” feel to her. The story just doesn’t flow, at all. I will not be trying out any of her other books. If I could say one thing to Flynn, it would be: Start over, at step one. Study the best story tellers, then figure out how to find your own true voice, instead of trying to dazzle readers (and yourself) with cutesy, clever words. God-awful book! Mary Ellen says: October 24, 2013 at 7:19 pm That too – what Susan said – spot on. Admiring her prose “cutsey” for a a myriad of horrible issues – which I find damaging to the well-being of our society – sounds dramatic but she made light of devastating things. On the bright side a poorly written book makes me think – “If they publish this cr*p then yeah I could be published too!” weewah says: February 3, 2014 at 8:16 pm Spot. Fucking. On. I came here to validate my hatred for this book. I will stay for your recommendations and other reviews. Jodie says: June 18, 2014 at 5:49 am I have never felt the need to comment on a book I have read but this one has both kept me gripped and annoyed me in equal measure. Some of the plot is so stupidly unbelievable. What was the point of “The Blue Boys” living in the abandoned Mall because they lost their jobs?? Does this happen anywhere? Their mention in the book was pointless and unnecessary. The beginning of the book was boring but I knew I had to keep at it as the reviews were s good. Why did Amy roll over and play dead when she got robbed? even I wouldn’t have done that and I am a wuss. The end was a bitter disappointment I was gutted when Amy came back, she did such a good job of setting Nick up that she could not reappear without spoiling what had been a good story. Did it explain how she got the code for the gate for after she killed Desi?. Why would Amy even want Nick? I imagine him like Hugh Grant (Yuck) weak and pathetic I and annoyed at the end of the book and yet still wish I had more to read, Maybe this is a sign of a good read haha Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

In 2008, the devious duo founded The Book Smugglers - a review blog dedicated to speculative and genre fiction for all ages, and an outlet for Ana and Thea's bottomless obsession with books and assorted SFF popgeekery.   Nominated for the 2014 Hugo Award for Best Fanzine Subscribe   Subscribe to Posts   Subscribe to Comments Prefer to get your daily Book Smuggler fix delivered to your inbox instead of via RSS?

The latest publishing sensation, Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, is flying off the shelves 'Gone Girl’ by Gillian Flynn (above) makes 'Bridget Jones’ look like teenage rom-com   Photo: REX By Sarah Rainey 8:30PM GMT 27 Mar 2013 Follow Comments Last weekend, I disappeared off the radar. Mobile off, landline unplugged, emails ignored, door locked. I was not to be disturbed. For an entire day, I shut myself in my living room, drew the curtains, curled up on the sofa – and began. Seven hours later, I emerged. Stunned, exhilarated, yet utterly absorbed in the 432 pages I’d consumed in a single sitting. You see, I’d just read Gone Girl, the psychological thriller by American author Gillian Flynn, which is being hailed as the publishing phenomenon of the year. Murder; manipulation; marital breakdown – it’s the best thing I’ve read in years, with a cleverly woven plot, toxic characters and twists as jagged as barbed wire. And it’s not just me who’s captivated. Flynn’s female noir novel is the latest literary sensation. To date, two million copies have sold worldwide. Since the paperback was published here in January, 500,000 copies and ebooks have flown off the shelves. Having spent 13 weeks at the top of the New York Times bestseller list, Gone Girl – ranked third on Amazon – is expected to eclipse the success of EL James’s Fifty Shades of Grey, the most-read novel of 2012. The critics call it “nerve-fraying”, with “the force of a pure but nasty addiction”. High-profile fans include Sarah Jessica Parker, Jackie Collins and Reese Witherspoon – who liked it so much she bought the screen rights for a reported $1.5 million (in association with 20th Century Fox). More imminently, Gone Girl has been longlisted for the 2013 Women’s Prize for Fiction (formerly the Orange Prize), and is hotly tipped as the only obstacle to Hilary Mantel, who has already won two major awards (Booker and Costa) for Bring Up the Bodies, from completing a literary hat-trick.

Weidenfeld & Nicolson, the British publisher, describes Gone Girl as “a smart book; not candy floss”. “It’s a great story that really captivates you,” explains Kirsty Dunseath, the group’s publishing director. “It asks that question: how well can you ever really know someone? What are the games played; the lies told within relationships?” The relationships theme is nothing new – but what makes Flynn’s book stand out is the extremes to which she takes it. As she explains: “Every marriage involves gamesmanship, little power-plays and squabbles. I just amplified it – a lot.” This is a woman who cites Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, the ultimate tale of a frustrated marriage, as an inspiration. As the story unravels, truths are peeled back and discarded, like layers of a Russian doll. American reviewers have compared the plot to “a house of mirrors” – both narrators are unreliable and deceitful; to each other, readers and themselves. Flynn’s characters, Nick and Amy Dunne, are apparently run-of-the-mill thirtysomethings – she, the girl-next-door, namesake of Amazing Amy, a children’s series written by her parents; he, an unemployed journalist – in an apparently happy marriage. But beneath the surface, dark things lurk. On their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy disappears. There are signs of a struggle, strange searches on Nick’s computer and a secret mobile phone. The police arrive, accusing Nick of murder. After that, I guarantee you won’t be able to put it down. Publishers say the novel’s success marks a seminal moment in fiction: the shift in readers’ appetites from chick lit to female noir. Gone Girl is the sort of book that makes Bridget Jones look like a teenage rom-com. “It’s dark but not too dark – and it’s not gory, like a lot of crime novels,” explains Ruth Tross, Mulholland Books editor at Hodder & Stoughton. “It taps into a trend for stand-alone psychological thrillers, with a strong mystery that keeps you turning the pages. Women who liked crime novels will love it. Women who liked chick lit will love it, too, because it’s full of emotion. The psychology of the characters is as intriguing as the crime.” Flynn’s account of the betrayals within a marriage leads readers to question their own assumptions, too. In order to win over Nick, Amy portrays herself as a “cool girl” – a beer-slugging, video game-playing version of every man’s ideal woman. But privately, she sees men as “dancing monkeys”, who will do anything to keep their spouses happy. Flynn’s tackling of these subjects is an unapologetic assault on our widely held beliefs about men and women. “It gets your grey matter working,” says Maxine Hitchcock of Simon and Schuster UK. “It is an interactive experience; you’re constantly thinking and challenging yourself. By the end, you feel as manipulated as they do.” Another factor boosting the book’s success is Flynn’s credibility. Gone Girl is almost universally adored. “The quality of writing shines through,” says Tross. “Books like Fifty Shades targeted a certain type of woman: it was all about romance, and this is a reaction to that romance. Flynn has written two novels before, both very well-received, so it hasn’t come out of nowhere.” Flynn, 42, a former television critic, wrote Gone Girl after being made redundant in 2009. Born in Kansas City, she now lives in Chicago with her husband Brett Nolan, a lawyer, and their son, Flynn. Her previous novels, Sharp Objects and Dark Places, both featured murders in small towns in the American Midwest; the same eerie setting she chose for Gone Girl. Her love of dark, manipulative protagonists came from a childhood fascination with horror films. “I watched Psycho a million times,” she once revealed. “In the mirror, I obsessively practised the Norman Bates smile right at the camera.” Others say it’s the structure of Flynn’s thriller that makes it work. I’ll give nothing away – but there’s one hell of a twist. “Most of the books I edit have tremendously soggy middles,” says Juliet Annan, Fig Tree publisher at Penguin. “This book’s middle was an incredible, extraordinary hammer blow.” Maxine Hitchcock even gave it to one of her authors as “homework – to learn about plot structure”. With a name like Gone Girl, you’d imagine the novel might only appeal to women. Not so, says the bestselling author Jojo Moyes, writing on her blog last summer. “My husband, who monopolised my Kindle for three days to read it, loved it just as much,” she recounted. The critic Philip Womack agrees. “That aspirational chick lit, with its obsession with labels, men and champagne, now looks outdated; and after the orgiastic excesses of Fifty Shades, people hunger for something a bit grittier.” Gone Girl’s striking orange and black cover makes it instantly recognisable. As well as dominating bookshop shelves, it’s being posted on social media sites as the ultimate fashion accessory, and other authors are choosing similar colours. Sabine Durrant’s Under Your Skin, Close My Eyes by Sophie McKenzie and ASA Harrison’s The Silent Wife will all feature neon colours on a dark background. “Good cover artwork gets past an overtly female title,” says Hitchcock. “The darkness inherent in the book necessitates a dark cover.” Gone Girl has got Britain under its spell. It’s intriguing, intelligent and startling. If you’re looking for something to immerse yourself in over the long weekend, look no further. And unlike Fifty Shades, this is one book you don’t have to hide in a brown paper bag.   Books Lifestyle » Culture » Book Reviews » Culture News » Culture Reviews »   Telegraph Book Shop Related Partners Love puzzles?

Reviewing crime fiction for your reading pleasure Criminal Reviews Home About Criminal Reviews The header photo Browsing: » Home »Gillian Flynn»Gillian Flynn – Gone Girl Leave a comment Gillian Flynn – Gone Girl Posted by thegirlfrommarz on 13 March, 2013 in Gillian Flynn, Gripping read, Psychological thriller, Review Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl is a breakout success, so much so that she is apparently writing a screen version of it at the moment. I have read her debut novel, Sharp Objects, and found it a cynical and bleak thriller about broken people who break others (that is not a complaint, by the way!). I am reading Dark Places at the moment and enjoying it. But Gone Girl is the one; the one that all the book groups are reading, the one that is on the shelves in the supermarket, the one that people ask you about as soon as they clock you reading it (“Ooh, what do you think of it?”). The question is, does Gone Girl deserve the hype? On the whole, I’d say the answer is yes. The ending is not as strong as I’d like, but the first part of the book is an engaging mystery; the second part of the book hits you hard with a twist and then speeds off, leaving you breathless and desperately trying to keep up as it gallops towards the ending. I was absolutely desperate to know what happened and literally could not put it down, reading far later into the night than I should have just to find out more. This is a stylish, brutal, well-written book that catches you and toys with you throughout. Gone Girl has an intriguing format that draws you in from the start, opening on the day that Amy Elliot Dunne disappears from the house she shares with her husband, Nick. Nick’s chapters, dating from the day Amy vanishes and going forward, are interleaved with Amy’s diary entries recounting the story of their relationship from the day they met up to the day she vanishes. Amy is the inspiration for a set of children’s books, the Amazing Amy series, written by her parents, and the Amazing Amy style and the magazine quizzes she now writes for women’s mags inform the way in which her diaries are written. Both protagonists write in the first person, so you come to know both Nick and Amy very well. As an aside, I love the way that Flynn’s books have been packaged. The matt black covers with neon text and images (pink, green and, in the case of Gone Girl, orange) are smart, stylish and fresh-looking. This is a great thriller that keeps you hooked up to the final pages. Although I found the ending slightly disappointing compared to the rest of the book, it’s only because the rest of the book was of such a high standard that the it was always going to be difficult for the ending to live up to my expectations. Rating: A SERIOUS SPOILERS AFTER THE JUMP SPOILERS  BELOW (seriously, do not read on unless you have finished the book). Readers of Flynn’s other work should not be surprised that Amy turns out to be more than the sweet, smart Cool Girl she initially appears. Flynn’s female protagonists tend to be dark, spiky and flawed. However, WHAT a twist! I did mourn the Amy of the diaries, whom I had grown to like very much, but this was a supremely confident piece of writing by Flynn, to write a character with such a strong and likeable voice, and then to reveal that Diary Amy is all the construction of a much more intelligent, much less likeable person with completely different motivations. The reveal of Amy’s true nature makes sense of seeming inconsistencies (which one of them doesn’t want children, for example) and makes you question your sympathies (my sympathy for Nick was seriously challenged by the late revelation that he has a very young mistress, for example – only to find myself back on Nick’s side when I understood just how monstrous Amy’s plan was). This is a book about twisted soulmates and about the power of knowing someone totally. At various times Amy and Nick both observe that the other one is the only one who knows them fully. In the final part of the book Nick and Amy descend into a symbiotic madness, where it’s no longer clear whether they hate or love each other (or both). They are equally obsessed, equally devoted to and full of hate for each other. Nick fantasizes about strangling Amy even as he plays the grieving husband for the media and the defeated loser for Amy. Having decided to destroy Nick to punish him for his affair and for believing her to be the Cool Girl she is playing at being, Amy then finds that she can’t bring herself to let go of the fight. I found it interesting that Amy’s original plan was to kill herself once she knew Nick would be blamed for her murder – another example of how the battle between them gives both her and Nick something to live for and more energy and motivation than either of them have had for a long time. Amy’s interlude with Desi is chilling in showing the way in which even very weak people can commit evil acts when they have power over others. Although Amy is a psychopath, I had no problem at all with her murdering Desi – his passive aggression and soft, spineless, manipulative evil was in its way almost as bad as Amy’s more dynamic, assertive monstrousness. At times Amy seems almost too prescient in anticipating Nick’s next move and I imagine there are weaknesses in the plot there if you want to go digging for holes, but as a dark and twisted psychological battle between two people, this book grips like a grippy thing. I found Nick’s final capitulation a slightly weak ending to an otherwise excellent book – I was expecting perhaps something more like the final scene of The Last Seduction, where as the hero remembers the final piece of incriminating evidence that might prove his story, the villain is shown destroying it. I suppose this is what Amy does with the reveal of her pregnancy – Nick’s plans for revenge come to nothing as he decides to stay with Amy and raise their child, a twisted version of the idyllic scene he imagines earlier in the book of he and Amy teaching their child the flags of various countries. However, Nick does get the last word (through Amy’s voice, of course!) when he tells her that he feels sorry for her because she has to wake up every morning and be herself. Having read Sharp Objects and Dark Places, I think this is Flynn’s most accomplished book so far. She is clearly a writer to watch out for in the future – although there are only so many times you can pull a truly shocking twist (by the end of Dark Places, the third book of hers that I read, although second in order of publication, I was looking out for some of the Flynn traits, such as hidden family nastiness and women who are much darker they seem). This is a thriller that deserves its hype. About these ads Like this: Like Loading...

On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy’s diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer? As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet? With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.   The Bookish Brunette thought: Fucked. Me. Up. When Amy goes missing, everyone is baffled – including her husband Nick. As the search for Amy intensifies and we catch glimpses into the depravity of Nick’s mind, I was at once convinced he killed her and buried her in the wall, all the while thinking, “there’s absolutely no way he did this.” Everything is wrapped in a big ball of “WHAT THE FUCK?!” Once you think you know what’s happened, is happening or is going to happen – Gillian Flynn throws in a fast curve ball, high and to the right that you NEVER SEE COMING until it smacks you in the face. Now every time I think, “Dear God… I’m literally insane.” I conjure up the vivid memory of Gone Girl and realize that I’m nowhere near as insane as I think I am. Or could be anyway. Nick is a very complex and intriguing character, and at times I couldn’t stand him… All while routing for him and hoping to God he didn’t kill her. We meet Amy through the pages of her diary, from the days before she met Nick until she went missing… Through this, we get both sides of how certain events in their history seemed in each others mind. I’m usually very hesitant to read books like Gone Girl… Because for one, the hype around such a highly acclaimed book usually leaves me feeling like the only person on Earth who didn’t get what all the fuss was about. And two because psychological thrillers aren’t really my thing. But after reading a review for Gone Girl over at Books With Cass, I knew I had to go for it. There are not words to fully express the twisted extremity of Gone Girl. There just isn’t. Until you read it – you have no idea what the term “mind-fuck” actually entails. So in the case of Gone Girl, there is truth behind all the raving that accompanies this book. Read. It. Gillian Flynn… Oh what have you done to my already fragile sense of sanity??? Favorite Quotes from Gone Girl: “A lot of people lacked that gift: knowing when to fuck off.” “Can you imagine, finally showing your true self to your spouse, your soul mate, and having him not like you? So that’s how the hating first began.” More Books By Gillian Flynn:           The following two tabs change content below.

Thanks for the awesome review! Reply Shane @ Itching for Books says: 02/19/2013 at 10:27 AM Great review. i need to read this one. Reply Anna @ Literary Exploration (YA) says: 02/19/2013 at 10:31 AM I’m reading (well listening) to this one right now!! I don’t know if it’s as crazy as everyone seems to say, at least not for me. But I’m only 6 hours in….. LOL! Hopefully things will pick up! Reply Amy @ Book Loving Mom says: 02/19/2013 at 11:50 AM This book is so around everywhere, but I honestly never paid attention to it. I have gotten away from reading blurbs on books and only skim them half the time. After reading your review for this I feel like I need to go buy it right the minute. Reply Ashley @ The Bibliophile's Corner says: 02/19/2013 at 11:56 AM I have been meaning to read this book and all of Gillian’s other books. After this review, I am definitely going to have to get my hands on it. Reply Kat (AussieZombie) (@katlb82) says: 02/19/2013 at 12:13 PM That girl is freaking nuts! Amy that is, not Gillian Flynn. Although perhaps Gillian Flynn is too, to think up this stuff! Ah you’ve made me want to go back and read it again now! Reply Vivien says: 02/19/2013 at 1:52 PM I absolutely LOVED THIS BLOODY BOOK. I recommended it to EVERYONE. I don’t even CARE if they don’t like it. I KNOW IT’S BLOODY AMAZING!!!! Anyhoo, did you know she’s from the KC area? Reply Melissa (@BooksThings) says: 02/19/2013 at 1:59 PM Now I’m more nervous about starting this one. What sanity? O.o I swear it’s been suggested for me to read by 2 people personally already! Now you have me curious as to what mind-fuck is happening here! Reply Kara @ Great Imaginations says: 02/19/2013 at 3:25 PM So I have no intentions of reading this book because it is not my thing, but I totally had to tweet a link to your review because it is so damn quotable. I laughed out loud. Your voice is one of a kind, Ashley! <3 Reply The Bookish Brunette says: 02/19/2013 at 3:34 PM OMG dude! This book is SOOOOOO not my thing either! AT ALL. But it was AMAZING! You must read it!!!! Reply Kara @ Great Imaginations says: 02/19/2013 at 3:42 PM Nooooooo! Maybe someday though. My tastes are always changing. Reply Kristin A. (@Hermyoni) says: 02/19/2013 at 7:14 PM I keep seeing this creeping up places. Great review, it almost makes me want to pick this one up and give it a shot. Reply midnightbookgirl says: 02/19/2013 at 8:13 PM I originally listened to the audio last year, but re-read it in January for book club. Our book club fortunately usually meets in member’s homes because the f bombs were flying! It was probably one of the best book discussions we’ve ever had (along with Fingersmith by Sarah Waters that has an even bigger WTF jaw dropping moment in it). Reply hollybindurham says: 03/06/2013 at 12:18 PM Oooh, Fingersmith…. now THAT is a great book too!! Reply Cassie says: 02/19/2013 at 9:05 PM Makes me SO HAPPY that it fucked you up as much as it did me! HOW GOOD WAS THIS!? ugh. Glad you read & witnessed the CRAZY. <2 Reply Felicia S. (@thegeekyblogger) says: 02/20/2013 at 6:53 AM I have read this one! It does fuck with your mind hard core and I think she does that brilliantly. Sharp Objects will do the same but in a different way! I think you should read that one too if you loved this one with a 5+ Reply Cassie says: 02/20/2013 at 11:01 AM OH OH, really? I was contemplating that one!! Reply hollybindurham says: 03/06/2013 at 12:22 PM I agree with Felicia – if you liked Gone Girl and liked the fact that it messed with your mind (which, apparently, you did!), then you’ll probably like Sharp Objects too! Maybe not QUITE as much, but pretty darn close. Though I admit I’m glad I read Gone Girl first because I do think it’s better than her first two….BUT that means she’s got a LOT to live up to with her 4th!! Reply Smash Attack says: 02/20/2013 at 8:40 AM I seriously cannot wait to read this! I love me a good trip down crazy lane! Reply tinasbkreviews says: 02/21/2013 at 8:33 AM Your review…..cracked me up. This was one of my favs last year, it was so demented!!!!! Reply kbeck13 says: 02/22/2013 at 4:45 AM Excellent review. I heard about this book on The Quivering Pen blog and after reading your review I absolutely need to read this. Reply MichelleR says: 02/27/2013 at 12:33 PM This book stays with you. Anyone who thinks they know how to write an unreliable narrator, or play mind games with readers, needs to study at the Gone Girl Academy. Reply Karen says: 03/01/2013 at 4:34 PM I really need to read this book. I think I got a little turned off by the hype but almost everyone that I trust loved this one. Loved your review. Reply hollybindurham says: 03/06/2013 at 12:15 PM YES! I have long been a fan of Gillian Flynn, since her first book was released, and I already thought she was a genius. But this….THIS! Totally messed with my mind!! This is, in my opinion, definitely the best of her three books, though the other 2 are also great. It is a complete and totally mind-f#*%!!!! And I loved every minute of it. Every. Single. Minute. Reply Mark says: 03/14/2013 at 4:10 PM Please, please, please don’t waste your time, you will never get that time back. I am an avid, well seasoned reader and this was the worst book I have ever read. It took me four attempts to get started and when I finally did I struggled to see what the story was about. Was it a romance, a thriller, a well conceived sub-plot. Well none of those sprang to my mind. It was weak, poorly conceived and worst of all a total misuse of the English language. In fact, I would say it was an insult to the English language. The story did not start to take any form until about page 247, which is about half way through the book, after which it maintained a steady page turning read, nothing gripping, but a page turner. Then, the so called heroine makes a reappearance and the story falls flat on it’s face……I must have been reading a differnt book juding the reviews on this site, but please believe me when I say DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! Do something less boring instead. Reply Bookish Brunette says: 03/14/2013 at 4:21 PM Um… Did you even take the time to read the article you just commented on? And I do believe you missed the entire point of the book. It was a psychological thriller… Meant to mess with your mind and leave you thinking, and “WTF?”… Perhaps it went beyond your capacity of comprehension? Reply MichelleR says: 03/14/2013 at 6:21 PM Mark, I used to review indie books for a website, and it was a firm policy with me to never presume to tell others what to read or not read. I would talk about my opinion, my experience, and then it would be up to the reader to make their own decision. I felt that I was there to help the reader, and if the information I shared led them to a different conclusion than my own, the review was still successful. It would never occur to me to have the hubris to go on another person’s site, and to pretend like I had a greater authority to tell their readership what to do with their time and money. That this is also one of the more widely reviewed and discussed books of the last year, and that readers have access to a wealth of opinion, makes your clear sense that your voice should be THE voice to be quite … well, ballsy. To be clear, it will be helpful to potential readers to hear why some readers didn’t care for Gone Girl, but you don’t know the tastes of the people who will encounter your comments enough to know it to be a waste of their time, particularly when discussion a book that has done exceptionally well based on buzz and word of mouth created by enthusiastic readers. Gillian Fynn has very little web presence, but the book exploded because a whole lot of people really did like it a lot. Doesn’t mean these people were “right,” but it does increase the odds of it being a book that others will like. Which makes your confidence in telling strangers that they won’t like it a bit of an overreach. Reply Colleen Dalton says: 03/15/2013 at 11:57 PM I feel I totally wasted my time reading this book. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Story was laughable, characters were unbelievable, plot was thin even with its multi layers. Reply Robin L Hovland Davis says: 03/20/2013 at 4:27 PM When I first started reading this book, I loved it. But by the end, I regretted buying it. It started out so strong, but it didn’t hold up. I went from thinking I would recommend it to everyone to thinking i wouldn’t suggest it at all. I just don’t know what happened…but it turned from great to lacking by the end. That’s only my opinion. I know that many loved it, and I know that I don’t share the same opinions as everyone where books are concerned. It has some really crazy moments and there was a point where I couldn’t put it down ….but the fact that it just fizzled at the end left me feeling disappointed. I wish the ending had been stronger to match the beginning. Reply ted fawcett says: 03/23/2013 at 7:04 PM Gone Girl I read three chapters of this book and gave up on it. That is extremely rare for me, almost unheard of infact. By the end of the third chapter I asked myself why am I reading this. I found it boring, tedious and wondering what is there here that lives up to such a billing. I found Nick and Amy uninteresting as characters and the book just died on me. Good luck to anyone who wants to plough through this. Ted Reply Vicky Manley says: 04/10/2013 at 3:48 PM Just read Gone Girl, my fist G Flynn book and have told all my friends they’re in for a treat. Could not put it down! Am bereft its finished and will upload another Gillian Flynn immediately. Envy those yet to read it. Reply Bookish Brunette says: 04/10/2013 at 4:10 PM OMG I have like WAY too many books that I wish I could read again for the first time!!!! O_O Reply Nola Carvill says: 04/11/2013 at 11:16 PM I’m halfway through Gone Girl – and those who have read it will know what tupsy turvy revelation has just “messed up” with my head! Just when you think you “have” IT – you realise you really have no idea…. Didn’t sleep last night – if my eyes weren’t that tired I’d keep on reading – instead Nick and Amy just kept me awake wondering… Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Email Subscribe PhatPuppy Art Grab some Brunette! <div align="center"><a href="http://www.bookish-brunette.com/" title=" The bookish brunette"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bb-banners/Grab-Button-5-23.png" alt=" The bookish brunette" style="border:none;" /></a></div> Events Currently Reading… The Bookish Brunette's books on Goodreads » Share book reviews and ratings with Ashley - The Bookish Brunette, and even join a book club on Goodreads.   The Bookish Brunette is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com Copyright © 2014 The Bookish Brunette Home   |   About    |    Contact Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

http://trackofthecat.blogspot.com/2013/03/an-analysis-gone-girl-by-gillian-flynn.html
Monday, March 11, 2013 An Analysis: Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn Walker Percy's novel, The Moviegoer, which won the National Book Award back in 1961, made the observation that people were becoming less authentic: “Other people, so I have read, treasure memorable moments in their lives: the time one climbed the Parthenon at sunrise, the summer night one met a lonely girl in Central Park and achieved with her a sweet and natural relationship, as they say in books. I too once met a girl in Central Park, but it is not much to remember. What I remember is the time John Wayne killed three men with a carbine as he was falling to the dusty street in Stagecoach, and the time the kitten found Orson Welles in the doorway in The Third Man.” Fifty-some years later, this idea is reprised in the runaway best-seller, Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, in the following quote: "We were the first human beings who would never see anything for the first time.  We stare at the wonders of the world, dull-eyed, underwhelmed, Mona Lisa, the Pyramids, the Empire State Building.  Jungle animals on attack, ancient icebergs collapsing, volcanoes erupting.  I can't recall a single amazing thing I have seen firsthand that I didn't immediately reference to a movie or TV show.  A fucking commercial. . .' "I've literally seen it all, and the worst thing is that the secondhand experience is always better.  The image is crisper, the view is keener, the camera angle and the soundtrack manipulate my emotions in a way reality can't anymore.  I don't know that we are actually human at this point, those of us who are like most of us, who grew up with TV and movies and now the Internet.  If we are betrayed, we know the words to say; when a loved one dies, we know the words to say.  If we want to play the stud or the smart-ass or the fool, we know the words to say.  We are all working from the same dog-eared script.' "It's a very difficult era in which to be a person, just a real, actual person, instead of a collection personality traits selected from an endless Automat of characters." Walker Percy's The Moviegoer is a very good book.  I'd like to say that Gone Girl is an equally good book, but it falls far short of that.  It is an overly-hyped revenge thriller which relies upon the unreliable narrator, sharply written but flawed, lacking a credible and clear distinction between the psychopathic and the normally empathetic and compassionate.  The two protagonists are both insufferable psychopaths. If they were consistent psychopaths, I might not complain as much.  But the woman who turns out to be a manipulative control freak somehow has no problem giving the last of her $80,000 family trust to her then-alienated husband to open a bar with his twin sister, whom she never liked.   This woman obsessively revenges those who have wronged her, yet there is no talk of revenge against the seedy couple who steal all of her money and leave her stranded.  Those are the most obvious errors and they will doubtlessly fix them in the upcoming Reese Witherspoon movie.  Unlike life, fiction has to make sense. Gillian Flynn and Reese Witherspoon There are other glaring flaws and inconsistencies.   For openers, the title, Gone Girl, has an absolutely false ring to it considering all the talk about gender issues in here.  Girl is an inappropriate title for a woman in her thirties unless it is meant playfully or ironically--and if that is the case, then The Cool Girl would have been a more aptly ironic title, since the protagonist defines one of her pretended personalities as such: “That night at the Brooklyn party, I was playing the girl who was in style, the girl a man like Nick wants: the Cool Girl.  Men always say that as the defining compliment, don't they?  She's a cool girl.  Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she's hosting the world's biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot.” "Hot and understanding.  Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want.  Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl. Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them." There is a lot of talk in here about women in the tabloid media, cartoonish plays upon Oprah-like TV hosts, Court TV, and such.  Gone Girl is at best a B satire which will probably make a mediocre B movie, despite the talents of Reese Witherspoon.  Too bad they couldn't find a young Liza Minnelli to play the part: “I feel myself trying to be charming, and then I realize I’m obviously trying to be charming, and then I try to be even more charming to make up for the fake charm, and then I’ve basically turned into Liza Minnelli: I’m dancing in tights and sequins, begging you to love me. There’s a bowler and jazz hands and lots of teeth.” ― Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl Posted by Richard L. Pangburn at 10:56 PM Email This BlogThis!

ReplyDelete Sean Patrick Reardon March 12, 2013 at 3:16 PM Someone gave my wife Gone Girl and raved about it. She he had not read it, so I gave it a try, while waiting out my sons hockey practice. I gave it a fair chance, but at around 70 pages, I had to give up. It was going nowhere, and the diary entries were so unrealistic. I ended up skipping to the end, just to find out what happened. That just made my opinion of GG even worse and thankfully I did not read the entire novel to get to the completely unrealistic ending. Basically felt like I was a reading a YA version (with the exception of the profanity that was sprinkled in) of the Scott Peterson story. ReplyDelete charmaine smith December 12, 2013 at 10:45 PM This book keeps your undivided attention from the first page. It is so interesting. Just when I thought I knew what was going on, the book takes such an unexpected twist. This book you will not be able to put down. The author did an amazing job of writing it and all the charactars come to life. You can see each one of them so clearly. I laughed out loud a couple of times and I have never done that with a book before. It is probably the best book I have read this year.

Skip to content Gozamos Menu Arts & Entertainment Music Lifestyle Food & Drink Tu Cultura Events Around the Web Podcasts Lifestyle Book Review: Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn By Jennifer Patiño on February 5, 2013 It took me a while to get around to reading “Gone Girl” by Gillian Flynn. The back cover and the inside flap read like a bad trailer. A seemingly perfect couple are about to celebrate their fifth year anniversary when it all goes horribly wrong. The wife goes missing and everyone in the small town thinks the husband did it. “Yawn,” I thought. “Lifetime movie yawn.” It’s the cynic in me who assumes that there is always something horribly wrong already with seemingly perfect couples. Maybe it’s because I first learned what a blow job was from the Lewinsky scandal. (“The president is an asshole,” said a 12 year old me.) But I work in a bookstore and people kept asking about it, so I decided to read it.  That way I would have more to say about it than “I heard it’s good,” which is bookstore code for “I know nothing about it, but please buy it.” Two days later I found myself staring off into space in my living room. My boyfriend walked by and asked me how the book was. All I could do was lift an accusing finger and tell him, as though at a police line-up: “That book. It did things to me.” I was lured in by the snarky, witty descriptive language of the author. She gives bright and slightly bitter insights into human nature in gems like: She twisted her precious rings on overknuckled fingers — twist, turn, creak — and fondled my arm (that old-person grope — cold fingers coveting your nice, soft, warm, new skin) and then Binks told me how her late husband of sixty-three years had trouble “keeping it in his pants.” Nick and Amy Dunne are both writers who have been put out of work by the internet’s demolition of the publishing industry. Nick decides to move them back home to Missouri to take care of his sick parents where he opens a bar using the last of Amy’s trust fund money. The resentment starts to build between the two as Nick continues to feel like a failure and Amy has nothing to do except wonder if Nick only ever loved her for her money. That’s the basic set up and as you read on, you will find yourself wondering what happened to Amy? Did Nick kill her? Who does treasure hunts for anniversaries? What the fuck? It slowly spirals, step by step, layer by layer into a tale of the kind of enmeshed insanity that can only happen when you let your guard down, when you’ve allowed flattery to cloud your instincts about what is really going on in a situation, in a relationship. There are so many genuine twists that you really can’t begin to guess what is going to happen. When you’re done reading this book, you will want to make everyone else around you read it so you can form group therapy sessions. It’s essentially a story that questions human nature and it will leave you feeling like you have just witnessed something horrifying.  I mean that in the best, this-would-never-be-on-Lifetime way.   Share this!
