Previous reports have described the prototype, part of the Big Dog project, as a robotic battlefield 'pack mule' capable of carrying 400lbs of equipment to help human solders in combat. But this latest footage reveals that the Alpha Dog has developed a scary new skill - throwing cinder blocks around with relative ease. See Alpha Dog in action below...  The latest Alpha Dog prototype lifts the cinder block with ease Previous prototypes of the mechanical quadruped were headless, but now a claw has been added which is very effective at picking up objects and flinging them around at great speed Previous prototypes of the mechanical quadruped were headless, but now a claw has been added which as the video shows is very effective at picking up objects and flinging them around at great speed. The footage was posted on YouTube by Boston Dynamics, the company being funded by DARPA and the Marine Corps to develop this sinister robot.   More...

This sort of dynamic, whole-body approach to manipulation is used routinely by human athletes and will enhance the performance of advanced robots.’ As technological advances improve the range of weapons and equipment at soldiers' disposal, so their loads become heavier. The development of the Alpha Dog was supposedly being developed to help carry this heavy equipment into battle and improve the efficiency of human soldiers. Funding for the Big Dog project is being provided by DARPA, the U.S. defense agency responsible for the development of new technologies for use by the military Take that! The cinder block smashes into pieces as it crashes to the ground With each new prototype that is revealed, the Alpha Dog is making impressive progress. Where once it resembled 'Bambi on ice' and could be unsteadied by undulating ground due to its long thin legs, now the Alpha Dog's thicker legs make it more powerful and stable. It can now trot around on its own and is smart enough to take voice commands from its soldier masters. Soon it will be capable of traveling 20-miles in a 24-hour period without having to refuel. These development are undoubtedly impressive from a technological advancement point of view, but what does it mean for the future of warfare? It's not unimaginable that it could also wear a camera and a rocket launcher and be re-purposed as an attack dog. A previous prototype of the Alpha Dog is pictured being tested in a forest environment Terminator: Could the Big Dog project evolve into something more sinister? If the current prototype can throw heavy blocks around with comparative easy, what could it potentially throw in the near future – humans? The pro-type is eerily similar to the powerful metal endoskeleton killing machines that feature in the Terminator movie franchise. Fans of the films will recall that the human race is all but destroyed when an artificial intelligence network called Skynet becomes self-aware in the near future and the war machines turn on their masters. Let's hope the Alpha Dog isn’t a chilling premonition of what lies ahead for the human race.

Aftermath News Independent Post-9/11 News Skip to content Home About ← TSA to Allow Small Knives on Planes Russia puts murdered whistleblower on trial → Scary Army robot that runs faster than humans throws huge cinder blocks around like a child throwing toys Posted on March 6, 2013 | 2 Comments Terminator: Could the Big Dog project evolve into something more sinister? The pro-type is eerily similar to the powerful metal endoskeleton killing machines that feature in the Terminator movie franchise. Daily Mail | Mar 2, 2013   By David Mccormack These are the latest chilling images of the LS3 Alpha Dog, the four-legged robot that DARPA, the U.S. defense agency responsible for the development of new technologies for use by the military, is developing. Previous reports have described the prototype, part of the Big Dog project, as a robotic battlefield ‘pack mule’ capable of carrying 400lbs of equipment to help human solders in combat. But this latest footage reveals that the Alpha Dog has developed a scary new skill – throwing cinder blocks around with relative ease. Previous prototypes of the mechanical quadruped were headless, but now a claw has been added which is very effective at picking up objects and flinging them around at great speed Previous prototypes of the mechanical quadruped were headless, but now a claw has been added which as the video shows is very effective at picking up objects and flinging them around at great speed. The footage was posted on YouTube by Boston Dynamics, the company being funded by DARPA and the Marine Corps to develop this sinister robot. As well as the footage is a short message which reads: ‘The goal is to use the strength of the legs and torso to help power motions of the arm. This sort of dynamic, whole-body approach to manipulation is used routinely by human athletes and will enhance the performance of advanced robots.’ As technological advances improve the range of weapons and equipment at soldiers’ disposal, so their loads become heavier. The development of the Alpha Dog was supposedly being developed to help carry this heavy equipment into battle and improve the efficiency of human soldiers. With each new prototype that is revealed, the Alpha Dog is making impressive progress. Where once it resembled ‘Bambi on ice’ and could be unsteadied by undulating ground due to its long thin legs, now the Alpha Dog’s thicker legs make it more powerful and stable. It can now trot around on its own and is smart enough to take voice commands from its soldier masters. Soon it will be capable of traveling 20-miles in a 24-hour period without having to refuel. These development are undoubtedly impressive from a technological advancement point of view, but what does it mean for the future of warfare? It’s not unimaginable that it could also wear a camera and a rocket launcher and be re-purposed as an attack dog. If the current prototype can throw heavy blocks around with comparative easy, what could it potentially throw in the near future – humans? The pro-type is eerily similar to the powerful metal endoskeleton killing machines that feature in the Terminator movie franchise. Fans of the films will recall that the human race is all but destroyed when an artificial intelligence network called Skynet becomes self-aware in the near future and the war machines turn on their masters. Let’s hope the Alpha Dog isn’t a chilling premonition of what lies ahead for the human race. Like this: Like Loading... Related This entry was posted in AI Robotics, Military Industrial Complex.

This raises the concern that as software becomes more and more important in controlling this army of machines, as is the case with Israel and it’s automated border vehicle/drones, what safe guards are in place to prevent the machines from getting “loose” or being “compromised” in a cyber attack. The sad answer is precious little. vekata raghavaraju budharaju | May 1, 2013 at 10:31 am | good morning / afternoon / evening friends . first, let me tell you how nice, happy, i am feeling exactly now ! . you know i love all life forms very much :) .

Geekologie I Watch Stuff The Superficial Facebook Twitter Google+ Home Videos Video Games Archives Send Us Tips! Uh-Oh: Robotic BigDog Now Has A Brick-Throwing Head March 1, 2013 in apocalypse, are you a dog or a horse or a seal make up your mind, bigdog, boston dynamics, bricks, but why, cinderblock, count me out, dammit i've been writing my congressperson about getting this project canceled for months now with zero response, DARPA, dueling to the death, no no and more no, not cool, robotic death army, the end nears, throwing things Facebook Twitter Google+ How do you make a BigDog quadruped robot even more terrifying? Simple, add a cinderblock-throwing head attachment. It can actually chuck them pretty far too -- probably about as far as I could. So if it ever comes down to a cinderblock throwing duel to the death, it could be anybody's game. I only ask you avenge my death when it kills me. Hit the jump, watch the video, and start boarding up any ground-level windows in your house. Thanks to Andrew and Mike, who both agree there is zero purpose for a brick-throwing robot that doesn't involve vandalism. Whats next -- graffiti robots? They actually already have those. Facebook Twitter Google+ There are View Comments. porkleaker I preemptively named my router SkyNet. Guest Chuck Norris would love to play fetch with this robut dog. Registeredwithem Truly amazing to watch this project develop. Fucked up that the main impetus is making war, though. Also, nice to get back on the site. I know the malware warnings were probably false, but I don't take risks with that. What gives? Rick PepperJack Haertle I actually had a dream about the BigDog last night except it had six legs, could sprint, and had an articulating head with one eye on it. This thing is literally nightmare fuel. Idlethoughts Look up hexopods robots... Paul Netro I for one welcome our new Robot PackElephants... Dsembr How are people supposed to get the heads up on the robot apocalypse when this site is riddled with malware warnings? You'd do your readers a great courtesy to fix that, GW. Vladplaya Why does it have to keep moving its legs, I feel like its waste of energy, they should look into making it just take a good still posture once in a while. Angel Mass The idea here is for them to show how it can maintain its equilibrium even in such complex conditions. Tyler AitchKay I just don't understand this BigDog monstrosity. What is it even trying to achieve? catallergy World domination. One cinder-block at a time. Kevin This thing can go where other traditional rovers, 4 wheeled-camera mounted remote controlled devices can't go. You'd be able to send it into places like nuclear reactors that have gone critical to do damage assessments. Send it into war-torn areas to look for survivors, etc. Be nice to have it able to clear debris. You'd be able to send it in to rescue people where it would otherwise be too dangerous to send a human, etc. Many, many applications for such a strong, versatile robot. Tyler AitchKay Clearing debris: one cinder block at a time Idlethoughts It's a start.

Robotics Zeitgeist Artificial Intelligence and Robotics blog Privacy Policy « Multi-user spatial collaboration using augmented reality on mobile devices KUKA robot versus Tim Boll » BigDog dynamic manipulation: It throws a cement block! Boston Dynamics have amazed us more than once over the years having created some of the most incredible and, at times, scariest (not in the uncanny valley sense but more on the Terminator is real sense) robots. Their creations range from the jumping Precision Urban Hopper, the incredibly realistic dynamically balanced humanoid PETMAN, and, of course, the very familiar 4-legged robot mule BigDog. So, what are they up to recently? They just released a new video of BigDog equipped with a powerful robotics arm lifting and throwing a cement block with ease and elegance; also, it does this while maintaining perfect balance. And this is what much of the work at Boston Dynamics is focused on, real-time control of the most advanced robots on this planet. The main reason we are also so flabbergasted every time they release a new video. So, watch BigDog picking up and throwing a cement block across the room and join me in hoping that Daniel H. Wilson will soon released an updated version of his How To Survive a Robot Uprising: Tips on Defending Yourself Against the Coming Rebellion including tips on how to avoid getting knocked out by flying cement blocks BigDog Boston Dynamics cement block dynamically balanced robot military robot real-time control robot manipulation robot mule This entry was posted by Awesome-o on March 1, 2013 at 3:58 pm, and is filed under Robotics.

I think I read that they may actually use the BigDog in the military to carry packs and equipment. Reply ↓ Greg (1 year) That is definitely progression when a robot can throw something as heavy as a cement block. Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Switch to Desktop Site ROBOTICS BigDog grabs, lifts, and throws cinder blocks with its new arm By Jason Falconer February 28, 2013 13 Comments 5 Pictures Boston Dynamics' quadruped robot BigDog grabs a cinder block from the floor using its new arm attachment Image Gallery (5 images) Boston Dynamics' BigDog may have already been replaced by the beefier LS3, but that doesn't mean it's totally obsolete. Today the company unveiled a version of the quadruped equipped with an arm where a head (or tail) would go. As can be seen in the following video, it's powerful enough to lift and toss a heavy cinder block. View all Key to this work, funded by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, is that BigDog uses the dynamic forces of its whole body to help it throw the cinder block. It begins by taking several steps to the side before quickly accelerating as it swings its arm, temporarily launching itself into the air in the process. This approach is similar to the way an athlete winds up before throwing a discus, for example, and greatly enhances the robot's throwing power. Since few robots are as capable as BigDog when it comes to balance, it's an excellent platform to test these sorts of strenuous actions. It's somewhat puzzling that BigDog's new configuration doesn't include two arms, which is a form factor that has been explored by researchers in the past. Back in the early 1990s, the Japanese government unveiled a nuclear plant inspection robot with a humanoid upper-body that walked on four legs. The idea was to combine the stability of a four-legged robot with the manipulation capabilities of a human. More recently, a team at the Italian Institute of Technology has shown plans that would add a pair of arms to their quadruped HyQ, presumably for the same reasons. Perhaps with an arm or two BigDog – which has cost tens of millions to develop so far – could still help soldiers do some heavy lifting while its descendant is transporting gear out in the field. If a new version of BigDog had two arms to work with, it could presumably lift even heavier objects.

Since Fido watched "Terminator" it's a case of "Here puny human, fetch this ... or it's hasta la vista baby". joeblake 28th February, 2013 @ 11:43 pm PST Very impressive - but the real problem isn't neither the software, nor the mechanics of the process - is the cables hanging from above. Until a reliable powersource will not be attached to such a robot, it will remain at lab curiosity stage. Dan Vasii 1st March, 2013 @ 01:38 am PST @Dan Clearly you haven't looked at Big Dog at all except what you saw in this video, and yet made this big sweeping statements. Its more than capable of operating beyond a 'lab curiosity'. Chef Borjan 1st March, 2013 @ 03:07 am PST Since article started with the statement that BigDog has been replaced by LS3, I'm surprised the author resisted the temptation to ask, "Who says you can't teach an old Dog new tricks?" :) Suman M Subramanian 1st March, 2013 @ 08:37 am PST the elephant now has an android counter part. love it! Roger Chan 1st March, 2013 @ 09:09 am PST I can't even imagine where Big Dog will be in 30 years. Probably on Mars. Stradric 1st March, 2013 @ 10:33 am PST Oh great... now after it chases you, it can catch you... and throw you. Jay Lloyd 1st March, 2013 @ 01:03 pm PST @ Chef Borjan having watched the video, i can just imagine that device assisting soldiers in the field - as long as their opponents are all deaf ash 3rd March, 2013 @ 04:06 pm PST Airport baggage handling, anyone? John Ebbinghaus 3rd March, 2013 @ 07:26 pm PST Teach it how to Lay a cinder block wall ,and then you will have something. What a waste of brainpower...to build things simply to destroy...teach it to Create something ! Steven J Littlejohn 4th March, 2013 @ 03:35 pm PST People seem to be missing the point. The fact that during testing it is either tethered or carrying a noisy generator is completely irrelevant. Each subsequent engineering improvement we see in big dog is another significant improvement. The first generation could just walk, then it could walk on different inclines, then on loose rocks, then on ice. Its control system is also able to account for sudden changes in parameters, like when a person pushed it with their foot. And it maintains balance gracefully given how top heavy it is. This latest update is one where it can pick up a block of potentially uncertain weight and dimensions, and balance while throwing it. Just how well it does it is not obvious until you appreciate the slow motion video. I doubt the enemy will be laughing in a decade when they see a few dozen of these things armed with flamethrowers and grenade launchers, silently creeping up on their position. Nairda 4th March, 2013 @ 09:45 pm PST That was a pretty good throw! If it was given a club, I bet it could bash down a door. I'd like to see it jump through a picture window! I could easily see these robots getting recruited into police & fire depts this decade. How about put a 100' winch on his back for high-rise rescue, he could clamber up the stairs through smoke and fire to where you are stranded, give you a harness, and lower you off the balcony. Then go save others. Grunchy 8th March, 2013 @ 05:46 pm PST This is not comforting at all. No good can come from a robot that can damage us from a short distance. In couple of years they may be throwing us around. Do they make personal EMP machines? I can't worry about the robots AND the zombies.
