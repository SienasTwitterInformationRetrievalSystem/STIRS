What's more, the researchers have uncovered the molecular mechanism for this interaction, and show that a class of more potent drugs currently in clinical trials act in a similar fashion. Pharmaceutical compounds similar to resveratrol may potentially treat and prevent diseases related to aging in people, the authors contend. These findings are published in the March 8 issue of Science. For the last decade, the science of aging has increasingly focused on sirtuins, a group of genes that are believed to protect many organisms, including mammals, against diseases of aging. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that resveratrol, a compound found in the skin of grapes as well as in peanuts and berries, increases the activity of a specific sirtuin,SIRT1, that protects the body from diseases by revving up the mitochondria, a kind of cellular battery that slowly runs down as we age. By recharging the batteries, SIRT1 can have profound effects on health. Mice on resveratrol have twice the endurance and are relatively immune from effects of obesity and aging. In experiments with yeast, nematodes, bees, flies and mice, lifespan has been extended. "In the history of pharmaceuticals, there has never been a drug that binds to a protein to make it run faster in the way that resveratrol activates SIRT1," said David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School professor of genetics and senior author on the paper. "Almost all drugs either slow or block them." In 2006, Sinclair's group published a study showing that resveratrol could extend the lifespan of mice, and the company Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which was started by HMS researchers, was founded to make drugs more potent than resveratrol. (Sinclair is a co-founder of Sirtris, a GlaxoSmithKline company, and remains a scientific advisor. Sirtris currently has a number of sirtuin-activating compounds in clinical trials.) But while numerous studies, from Sinclair's lab and elsewhere, underscored a direct causal link between resveratrol and SIRT1, some scientists claimed the studies were flawed. The contention lay in the way SIRT1 was studied in vitro, using a specific chemical group attached to the targets of SIRT1 that fluoresces more brightly as SIRT1 activity increases. This chemical group, however, is synthetic and does not exist in cells or in nature, and without it the experiments did not work. As a response to this, a paper published in 2010 surmised that resveratrol's activation of SIRT1 was an experimental artifact, one that existed in the lab, but not in an actual animal. SIRT1 activity in mice was, the paper claimed, at best an indirect result of resveratrol, and perhaps even a sheer coincidence. As a result, a debate erupted over the particular pathway that resveratrol and similar compounds affected. Does resveratrol directly activate SIRT1 or is the effect indirect? "We had six years of work telling us that this was most definitely not an artifact," said Sinclair. "Still, we needed to figure out precisely how resveratrol works. The answer was extremely elegant." Sinclair and Basil Hubbard, then a doctoral student in the lab, teamed up with a group of researchers from both the National Institutes of Health and Sirtris Pharmaceuticals to address this question. First, the team addressed the problem of the fluorescent chemical group. Why was it required for resveratrol to rev up SIRT1 in the test tube? Instead of dismissing the result as an artifact, the researchers surmised that the chemical might be mimicking molecules found naturally in the cell. These turned out to be a specific class of amino acid, the building blocks of proteins. In nature, there are three amino acids that resemble the fluorescent chemical group, one of which is tryptophan, a molecule abundant in turkey and notable for inducing drowsiness. When researchers repeated the experiment, swapping the fluorescing chemical group on the substrate with a tryptophan residue, resveratrol and similar molecules were once again able to activate SIRT1. "We discovered a signature for activation that is in fact found in the cell and doesn't require these other synthetic groups," said Hubbard, first author of the study. "This was a critical result, which allowed us to bridge the gap between our biochemical and physiological findings. "Next, we needed to identify precisely how resveratrol presses on SIRT1's accelerator," said Sinclair. The team tested approximately 2,000 mutants of the SIRT1 gene, eventually identifying one mutant that completely blocked resveratrol's effect. The particular mutation resulted in the substitution of a single amino acid residue, out of the 747 that make up SIRT1. The researchers also tested hundreds of other molecules from the Sirtris library, many of which are far more powerful than resveratrol, against this mutant SIRT1. All failed to activate it. The authors propose a model for how resveratrol works: When the molecule binds, a hinge flips, and SIRT1 becomes hyperactive. Although these experiments occurred in a test tube, once the researchers identified the precise location of the accelerator pedal on SIRT1 -- and how to break it -- they could test their ideas in a cell. They replaced the normal SIRT1 gene in muscle and skin cells with the accelerator-dead mutant. Now they could test precisely whether resveratrol and the drugs in development work by tweaking SIRT1 (in which case they would not work) or one of the thousands of other proteins in a cell (in which they would work). While resveratrol and the drugs tested revved up mitochondria in normal cells (an effect caused activating by SIRT1), the mutant cells were completely immune. "This was the killer experiment," said Sinclair. "There is no rational alternative explanation other than resveratrol directly activates SIRT1 in cells. Now that we know the exact location on SIRT1 where and how resveratrol works, we can engineer even better molecules that more precisely and effectively trigger the effects of resveratrol." The researchers plan on continuing academic-industry collaborations with the goal of bringing to fruition drugs that treat diseases associated with aging.

It was an early celebration of a study published Thursday, which Sinclair hopes will finally settle a contentious debate that has been running since he showed 10 years ago that a red wine ingredient, resveratrol, can extend life. Continue reading below That influential work was done in yeast, but it immediately captured the attention of the public. People started gulping resveratrol supplements by the fistful, and a major drug company began trying to develop drugs that mimic the wine ingredient to fight diseases of aging. Meanwhile, research progressed along two streams. One confirmed the importance of the ingredient and similar compounds in prolonging lifespan or improving health in animals such as worms, fruit flies, and mice. But the other raised major questions about how resveratrol worked — or if it even did. The new study, published in the journal Science, details at a precise molecular level how resveratrol and related substances can activate an enzyme called a sirtuin. These enzymes are thought to be involved in DNA repair, inflammation, circadian clocks, and the creation of mitochondria, the power plants of the cell. Increasing the activity of sirtuins has been shown in some animal experiments to lengthen lifespan — though not in humans. Sinclair, who is a paid consultant to Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, the Cambridge company he cofounded to hunt for antiaging drugs, hopes the study will banish the debate about whether the drugs activate sirtuins, allowing the field to move forward. Sinclair also holds patents that are licensed to the company. “I’ve spent the last 10 years figuring this out,” said Sinclair, who had plaques made for his collaborators as a thank you for their help in untangling the complicated problem. “It almost brings me to tears to think how hard it’s been. There were so many people that didn’t believe in this, that I’m really grateful to the scientists who did stick with us and believe it was right.” Continue reading below Outside researchers were less enthusiastic. They said the new paper provided a plausible and more nuanced explanation for how resveratrol works, but will do little to clarify the bigger questions in the murky field. The role of a particular sirtuin, called SIRT1, in aging, “is still as clear as mud,” said Brian Kennedy, president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, a nonprofit research center in Novato, Calif. Shortly after the first resveratrol studies were published, outside researchers began to cast doubt on whether the way the researchers had set up the original experiment could have inadvertently influenced their results. To detect when the SIRT1 enzyme’s activity was kicked into overdrive, Sinclair’s team had attached a fluorescent tag to a molecule that interacted with it. That tag was meant to glow when the enzyme was active — a signal that could be easily seen by the scientists. But outside researchers later showed that the experiment depended on the presence of the artificial tag, which is not found in the body.Without the fluorescent tag, resveratrol did not increase the enzyme’s activity.In the new study, a team that included researchers from Sirtris rebuts that critique by describing the specific conditions under which the enzyme can be activated without the fluorescent tags. Next, the Harvard team randomly mutated the SIRT1 enzyme until finding a version that was resistant to resveratrol’s effect, allowing them to understand better the piece of the enzyme that was essential for their compounds to work. Such evidence, Sinclair said, could help scientists design better versions of drugs. Matt Kaeberlein of the University of Washington, an author of a 2005 study that pointed out the problem with the fluorescent tag, said the new study clarifies the precise biochemical conditions necessary for resveratrol and similar compounds to activate sirtuins. But he said he still had questions about the details of the enzyme’s activity — and about the connection to aging. “I would gauge the current feeling among the broader field as that sirtuins probably impact a subset of age-related diseases, but it’s still unclear how important they are for the aging process in general,” Kaeberlein wrote in an e-mail. Researchers deeply involved in sirtuin research, however, see the new work as reinforcing the initial and subsequent findings about the molecules. They note that evidence has accumulated that drugs that activate sirtuins can increase endurance of mice and provide major health benefits. “I feel not only vindicated by this paper, but by a series of studies in the last year and a half that have shown clearly that sirtuins do regulate aging in a wide variety of organisms, including mammals,” said Leonard Guarente, a biology professor at MIT and a consultant to Sirtris. “I think the pendulum swung way too far in terms of skepticism about sirtuins, and I think now we’re starting to come back to reality.” George Vlasuk, chief executive of Sirtris, which was bought by GlaxoSmithKline for $720 million in 2008, said the results revealed more about how resveratrol-like compounds work, and are guiding research into how to make new drugs. “It really puts to rest a lot of the controversy that has been surrounding this area for quite some time,” Vlasuk said. He said Sirtris is preparing reports of how its compounds fared in two clinical trials, of patients with type 2 diabetes and psoriasis. Carolyn Y. Johnson can be reached at cjohnson@globe.com.

The new study, published in the journal Science, details at a precise molecular level how resveratrol and related substances can activate an enzyme called a sirtuin. These enzymes are thought to be involved in DNA repair, inflammation, circadian clocks, and the creation of mitochondria, the power plants of the cell. Increasing the activity of sirtuins has been shown in some animal experiments to lengthen lifespan—though not in humans. Sinclair, who is a paid consultant to Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, the Cambridge company he cofounded to hunt for anti-aging drugs, hopes the study will banish the debate about whether the drugs activate sirtuins, allowing the field to move forward. Sinclair also holds patents that are licensed to the company. “I’ve spent the last 10 years figuring this out,” said Sinclair, who had plaques made for his collaborators as a thank you for their help in untangling the complicated problem. “It almost brings me to tears to think how hard it’s been. There were so many people that didn’t believe in this, that I’m really grateful to the scientists who did stick with us and believe it was right.” Outside researchers were less enthusiastic. They said the new paper provided a plausible and more nuanced explanation for how resveratrol works, but will do little to clarify the bigger questions in the murky field. The role of a particular sirtuin, called SIRT1, in aging, “is still as clear as mud,” said Brian Kennedy, president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, a nonprofit research center in Novato, Calif. Shortly after the first resveratrol studies were published, outside researchers began to cast doubt on whether the way the researchers had set up the original experiment could have inadvertently influenced their results. To detect when the SIRT1 enzyme’s activity was kicked into overdrive, Sinclair’s team had attached a fluorescent tag to a molecule that interacted with it. That tag was meant to glow when the enzyme was active—a signal that could be easily seen by the scientists. But outside researchers later showed that the experiment depended on the presence of the artificial tag, which is not found in the body. Without the fluorescent tag, resveratrol did not increase the enzyme’s activity. In the new study, a team that included researchers from Sirtris rebuts that critique by describing the specific conditions under which the enzyme can be activated without the fluorescent tags. Next, the Harvard team randomly mutated the SIRT1 enzyme until finding a version that was resistant to resveratrol’s effect, allowing them to understand better the piece of the enzyme that was essential for their compounds to work. Such evidence, Sinclair said, could help scientists design better versions of drugs. Matt Kaeberlein of the University of Washington, an author of a 2005 study that pointed out the problem with the fluorescent tag, said the new study clarifies the precise biochemical conditions necessary for resveratrol and similar compounds to activate sirtuins. But he said he still had questions about the details of the enzyme’s activity—and about the connection to aging. “I would gauge the current feeling among the broader field as that sirtuins probably impact a subset of age-related diseases, but it’s still unclear how important they are for the aging process in general,” Kaeberlein wrote in an e-mail. Researchers deeply involved in sirtuin research, however, see the new work as reinforcing the initial and subsequent findings about the molecules. They note that evidence has accumulated that drugs that activate sirtuins can increase endurance of mice and provide major health benefits. “I feel not only vindicated by this paper, but by a series of studies in the last year and a half that have shown clearly that sirtuins do regulate aging in a wide variety of organisms, including mammals,” said Leonard Guarente, a biology professor at MIT and a consultant to Sirtris. “I think the pendulum swung way too far in terms of skepticism about sirtuins, and I think now we’re starting to come back to reality.” George Vlasuk, chief executive of Sirtris, which was bought by GlaxoSmithKline for $720 million in 2008, said the results revealed more about how resveratrol-like compounds work, and are guiding research into how to make new drugs. “It really puts to rest a lot of the controversy that has been surrounding this area for quite some time,” Vlasuk said. He said Sirtris is preparing reports of how its compounds fared in two clinical trials, of patients with type 2 diabetes and psoriasis. Carolyn Y. Johnson can be reached at cjohnson@globe.com.

A picture shows a glass of red wine, on April 4, 2011 in Saint-Emilion, near Bordeaux, during the week of futures (semaine des primeurs). In following spring after a year's harvest, merchants and trade organization taste samples of wine that is often only 6 PIERRE ANDRIEU/AFP/Getty Images Shares Tweets Stumble Email More + Resveratrol, a natural antioxidant that is found in red wine and cocoa, has been lauded for its anti-aging benefits. In light of those claims, some companies are capitalizing on resveratrol's purported health benefits. Resvology, a skincare company, claims that their products have an ester form of resveratrol called resveratryl acetate that can smooth lines and wrinkles. Some spas including Les Sources de Caudalie in Martillac, France and Aire ancient baths in New York offer baths filled with red wine. The big difference is instead of taking supplements or drinking your way to youth, these resveratrol treatments supposedly work by soaking in through your skin. Could the secret to eternal youth be as simple as slathering resveratrol on your skin? Red wine may reduce men's blood pressure - but only if it's non-alcoholic Large amounts of red wine compound resveratrol may help with balance in elderly people Study examines red wine's anti-aging ingredient, resveratrol Dr. Joseph Maroon, a resveratrol expert who wrote the book "The Longevity Factor: How Resveratrol and Red Wine Activate Genes for a longer and healthier life" and professor and vice chairman of the department of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh, said to CBSNews.com that to understand how resveratrol works, you have to understand where it comes from. Resveratrol is a polyphenols antioxidant and one of 600 antimicrobial compounds known as a phytoalexin, which is produced by plants to protect them from adverse conditions including excessive ultraviolet light, infections and climactic changes. Earlier resveratrol studies have suggested the compound could bring health benefits. One 2012 study showed that when older laboratory mice with balance issues were given high doses resveratrol for four weeks, they were able to successfully walk across a balance beam (However, for humans to get that amount of resveratrol from drinking red wine alone, they'd need to consume about 700 bottles). Another July 2011 study suggested red wine could be "exercise in a bottle," because resveratrol countered the effects of inactivity in mice. Other mice studies have found resveratrol might protect against obesity and diabetes, reduce the risk for blood clotting, or reduce "bad" LDL cholesterol, according to the Mayo Clinic. Maroon explained that because resveratrol has the ability to dilate blood vessels, increase nitric oxide and block the stickiness of platelets, it is a good compound to target heart problems. But, while researchers haven't found any harm in taking resveratrol supplements, most of the resveratrol in the supplements can't be absorbed by the body, the Mayo Clinic pointed out. Compounding the issue, some resveratrol studies recently came into question last January after a preeminent resveratrol researcher, Dr. Dipak K. Das, director of the cardiovascular research center at the University of Connecticut, was accused of falsifying data. Research is limited when it comes to resveratrol's anti-aging benefits when applied externally on humans, but there have been some studies that suggest the compound could help skin. In one study published by the National Institutes of Health in 2005, resveratrol was applied to the skin of laboratory animals, who were then subjected to high ultraviolet radiation. Researchers found the compound protected the animals. "It was a very good sunblock," Maroon explained. "It might be the ultimate sunblock for both plants in animals. In animals, it was shown to help the prevent the development of skin cancer." Heather Hausenblas, an associate professor at the College of Health and Human Performance at the University of Florida in Gainseville, Fla., said to CBSNews.com that another recent study published in the Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology in Oct. 2012 showed that people who took resveratrol orally for more than 60 days had improvements in their skin. Their skin was more moist, less rough, had better elasticity, and participants' age spots had decreased. Another study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology in 2011 found that people who used a gel containing resveratrol on their skin for 30 days reduced acne by about 54 percent, according to a Global Acne Grading System (GAGS). "It does make intuitive sense (it would work on your skin)," she concluded. Hausenblaus emphasized the important thing to note about the studies is that the subjects took resveratrol for an extended period of time, not just did a one-time treatment. She likened it to taking prescription medication once over two weeks instead of every day: "You aren't going to see an effect," she said. "They were taking this for 60 days -- not just an hour in an expensive red wine bath," she added. "There might be some short-term effects, but a week later your skin's probably going to be back to what it was," she pointed out, adding that the level of resveratrol in the wine could also play a role in how beneficial the treatments could be. From what she knew about resveratrol, Hausenblaus would be open to buying skin cream with the compound even if science hasn't proven the topical application benefits just yet. However, so far studies suggest the best way to get resveratrol's supposed benefits is through other methods. "That would be my opinion. I'd rather drink it than pour it on my skin," Maroon stated. © 2013 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Skip to main content Newsroom Search Search scope All UNSW Websites This website Menu Main menu Home News Opinion Publications Find an Expert News Office For Staff Anti-ageing drug breakthrough News Anti-ageing drug breakthrough 07 March 2013 Drugs that combat ageing may be available within five years, following landmark work led by an Australian researcher. The work, published in the March 8 issue of Science, finally proves that a single anti-ageing enzyme in the body can be targeted, with the potential to prevent age-related diseases and extend lifespans. The paper shows all of the 117 drugs tested work on the single enzyme through a common mechanism. This means that a whole new class of anti-ageing drugs is now viable, which could ultimately prevent cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and type 2 diabetes. “Ultimately, these drugs would treat one disease, but unlike drugs of today, they would prevent 20 others,” says the lead author of the paper, Professor David Sinclair, from UNSW Medicine, who is based at Harvard University. “In effect, they would slow ageing.” The target enzyme, SIRT1, is switched on naturally by calorie restriction and exercise, but it can also be enhanced through activators. The most common naturally-occurring activator is resveratrol, which is found in small quantities in red wine, but synthetic activators with much stronger activity are already being developed. Although research surrounding resveratrol has been going for a decade, until now the basic science had been contested. Despite this, there have already been promising results in some trials with implications for cancer, cardiovascular disease and cardiac failure, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, fatty liver disease, cataracts, osteoporosis, muscle wasting, sleep disorders and inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, arthritis and colitis (inflammatory bowel disease). “In the history of pharmaceuticals, there has never been a drug that tweaks an enzyme to make it run faster,” says Professor Sinclair, a geneticist with the Department of Pharmacology at UNSW. The technology was sold to pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline in 2008[i]. Four thousand synthetic activators, which are 100 times as potent as a single glass of red wine, have been developed – the best three are in human trials. “Our drugs can mimic the benefits of diet and exercise, but there is no impact on weight,” says Professor Sinclair, who suggests the first therapeutic to be marketed will be for diabetes. There have been limited trials in people with type 2 diabetes and the skin inflammatory disease, psoriasis. There were benefits to the metabolism in the first group and a reduction in skin redness in the second. The drugs can be administered orally, or topically. So far, there have been no drugs developed targeting ageing skin, but one major skin care range has developed a crème with resveratrol in it. While any drug would be strictly prescribed for certain conditions, Professor Sinclair suggests that one day, they could be taken orally as a preventative. This would be in much the same way as statin drugs are commonly prescribed to prevent, instead of simply treating, cardiovascular disease. In animal models, overweight mice given synthetic resveratrol were able to run twice as far as slim mice and they lived 15 per cent longer. “Now we are looking at whether there are benefits for those who are already healthy. Things there are also looking promising,” says Professor Sinclair, who also heads the Lowy Cancer Research Centre’s Laboratory for Ageing Research at UNSW. “We’re finding that ageing isn’t the irreversible affliction that we thought it was,” he says. “Some of us could live to 150, but we won’t get there without more research.” Media contact: Susi Hamilton, UNSW Media Office, +61 422 934 024, susi.hamilton[at]unsw.edu[dot]au [i] Professor Sinclair formed a started up company Sirtris to develop the anti-ageing technology. This was subsequently sold to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Professor Sinclair is now a scientific advisor to GSK. Several other authors on the paper work for GSK or an affiliated company.

IRA FLATOW, HOST: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, I'm Ira Flatow. Here's some news to raise a glass to: the idea that red wine may help us live longer and healthier lives. Well, it got a new boost this week. According to a team of researchers, a compound found in the skin of grapes could be an antidote to aging by slowing down the process and even fending off disease and inflammation associated with getting old. It's the topic of a new study published this week in the journal Science. But before you pop the cork on that merlot, this story doesn't end there. The study's researchers are hoping these findings will help drug companies develop anti-aging drugs to treat diseases like Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and even obesity. Sound too good to be true? Well, my next guest is here to talk about it. David Sinclair is professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Med School in Boston. He's lead author of the study that was published this week in Science. He joins us from California. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. DAVID SINCLAIR: Hi, Ira, thanks for having me on. FLATOW: Are we talking about resveratrol here? SINCLAIR: Well, the resveratrol discovery was about 10 years ago. We, my colleagues and I, made that discovery. But what we've done since then is use that as a - just a stepping stone, a proof of concept to make much more potent synthetic drug-like molecules that are just in the beginnings of human clinical trials. And this paper is about the finding that these molecules from grapes and the synthetics all seem to work through this one particular gene, genetic pathway we call the sirtuin pathway. FLATOW: Let's back up a little bit and talk about the study you did in mice. What did you find - what did you give the mice, and what did you find there? SINCLAIR: Well, originally we found resveratrol just in a test tube, looking for molecules that would turn on this enzyme, this protein that seems to defend against diseases in aging. We then moved to nematode worms and flies. We've done some work with bees even. The mouse study was in 2006. These were mice that were fed a Western diet. They were chubby, and they were developing usual signs of disease that we see in elderly obese people. The mice that had the resveratrol in their diet were still obese, but they were seemingly or relatively immune to the effects of the obesity. So their arteries were clear, their liver was nice and thin. Their bones were stronger. They could run further. And so that was really the first evidence that we were on to something important for - potentially for human health. FLATOW: And so then you identified the action of how the molecule works. SINCLAIR: Right, so that's what we've been doing for the last few years, is trying to figure out, first of all - we've been criticized for this. It does sound too good to be true. And turning on proteins rather than just inhibiting them is fairly rare in drug development and even biology. So this was, on multiple levels, seemingly too good to be true, and what we've done in this paper with my colleagues, and there are actually 30 authors that I'm here representing, we were able to, I think, very well demonstrate how these molecules work not just in the test tube but even within cells, hitting a very precise part of this protein that we think controls health and possibly aging. FLATOW: Well, give us some of the details of that. When you mean it controls aging and these other miraculous-sounding things, give us some idea of what you're talking about. SINCLAIR: Well, it's important to know that I'm also here representing a field of scientists, probably hundreds of labs around the world who are focused on finding what are the causes of aging and more important, actually, the genes that can slow that down. And we know of probably 100 of these genes now, and they fall into certain groups. There are about four major categories. One of them is the sirtuins, which I work on. There are others. There's even a compound from Easter Island that seems to have also remarkable effects on anti-aging, on aging and extending lifespan in mice. So what we're all hoping to do, us researchers, is to develop ways to not really just extend lifespan but to keep people healthier for longer. We may just have a greater impact than a single drug because these drugs could potentially treat one disease but prevent 20 others. FLATOW: And so you actually co-founded a company called Sirtris, which is now owned by GlaxoSmithKline, to come up - to create these compounds, these anti-aging compounds? SINCLAIR: Well, it's true. A lot of scientists are hesitant to get involved with industry. It's seen as, you know, getting in bed with the devil, actually. But I found that doing this has been really the only way and one of the best ways I know to take a finding from the bench side to people. There's no other way, in fact. This drug, if we ever succeed, is going to cost probably a billion dollars, and no academic lab can do that. So yeah, I'm still working with, as a consultant to, GlaxoSmithKline. But they're the ones who have done the hard chemistry. They've made 4,000 different variants of chemicals that activate this pathway, and the best couple of those have gone into human studies. FLATOW: So when you activate the pathway, this enzyme, what does - what kind of benefits happen from that? SINCLAIR: Well, there are probably 1,000 papers now on this genetic pathway and the benefits of resveratrol. Not all the effects of resveratrol of course go through this one pathway. We think many of the important ones do. So for instance, we commonly see with these molecules that the animals are, as I mentioned, protected from the effects of obesity, so the lack of inflammation, their hearts are a bit stronger, their arteries are cleaner. They also seem to have improved brain function. They're protected against diseases like Alzheimer's. And they also seem to have more energy. We see that the mitochondria, these energy battery packs in our muscles and our liver, in fact in all of our cells, get revved up by these drugs. And this could be a way to give elderly people or sick people more energy and to fight disease, and possibly live longer. FLATOW: Why not just drink a lot more red wine and get it that way? SINCLAIR: Well, I don't recommend people do that because the amount of resveratrol that's needed I estimate to be about 100 glasses a day, which is probably not recommended. So really what we're trying to do here is to develop drugs that could be taken as a little pill, maybe 250 milligram little pill, that could be used to treat diabetes but would also prevent cancer, Alzheimer's and inflammatory diseases. And yeah, I don't recommend people try to get resveratrol out of red wine, though I've been drinking red wine every few days because I know there are some health benefits, but definitely don't go overboard. FLATOW: Could you do it with grape juice too? SINCLAIR: Well, actually, there's not much resveratrol in grape juice. Red wine has about a milligram or two per glass. But we're talking about hundreds of milligrams in these studies. FLATOW: How is it that you get such a widespread benefit in all the different organs from just this one enzyme? SINCLAIR: That is the best question. What we think is going on is that - well, let me back up. The old idea was that resveratrol and a lot of these compounds that seem to improve health work just because they're antioxidants. But it turns out resveratrol and red wine generally, it's not really a great antioxidant, and in fact it's been rather disappointing, the results for antioxidants in the aging field. So what we think is going on to have these, as you said, miraculous-like effects, is that these longevity genes, that there are many of these in our body, they get activated by adversity. So when we exercise, when we have a very low-calorie diet or even calorie-restrict, these pathways get activated, and they tell proteins in the cell to go off, say repair DNA better or turn on the energy supply more. And we think that those complex pathways downstream regulated by these master regulators of health are responsible. FLATOW: And resveratrol is - knows the pathway of how to do that, and these other drugs that you're developing basically do the same thing? SINCLAIR: Well, that's the theory. And in this paper that we just put out, what we're showing evidence for is that we're on target, that we are making drugs, and resveratrol as well, hits this enzyme in the cell that has these remarkable benefits, at least in animals so far. FLATOW: So could you eventually market these as anti-aging drugs then? SINCLAIR: Well, if they worked, it would be great. I think proving that is going to take too long, I think, for most of us to wait. The way I think the first anti-aging drug will hit the market, and I don't know if it's going to be this work or someone behind us or even in front of us, there are a lot of people trying, but when it happens, and I think it will happen in our lifetimes, it'll be for a particular disease, because the drug approval process doesn't recognize aging as a disease. You couldn't get it on the market. But eventually I think if enough people take this medicine, let's say 10,000 people are on the drug, we would start to see even within a few years whether those people are generally healthier and possibly even longer lived than the general population. FLATOW: And how soon will these trials start? SINCLAIR: Well, my colleagues roll their eyes whenever any of us gives an estimate. But I can say that we're in - the companies are in phase one studies. Phase one studies means very small trials with, say, a dozen, up to 100 people. And the results so far have been promising, but they haven't proven anything. The timeframe forward typically from here on is about five years if things go well. But, you know, we have to be cautious because things can go wrong, and they often do in drug development. But, you know, we're certainly a lot closer than I ever thought we would be in my lifetime, and I certainly never thought that I'd be seeing patients given a drug that came out of the aging field so quickly. FLATOW: Are there any bad side effects to this? SINCLAIR: Well, if you use really, really high doses of resveratrol, many grams, there can be some untoward side effects, some toxicity. So again, people shouldn't consider doing that. In the mouse studies, we haven't seen any signs of toxicity yet. We've been actually quite surprised. We've looked hard. We thought maybe there was a tradeoff, cancer would be invoked, or fertility would decline. We haven't seen any of that. And in these initial human studies that have recently been published with the synthetic compounds from - that are in the clinical trials, they also, at least so far in small numbers of people, seem to be safe. But we need more people, of course. But there's nothing that I'm particularly worried about right now. FLATOW: So in effect you basically slowed down the aging process in mice, or did you reverse it? Did you take away the aging process so they could live a lot, lot longer? SINCLAIR: Well, my colleagues and I debate whether we're really slowing down aging or we're just preventing diseases. That's probably going to be a debate we continue for a while. But in my lab, we are working on compounds that clearly do reverse aging or aspects of aging. We've got mice - we haven't published this yet, but just as a heads-up, we've got compounds that can take a two-year-old mouse, which is a pretty old mouse, and reverse its metabolic aging within just a week. So I'm looking forward to not just delaying aging but even possibly reversing some of it. FLATOW: Wow. Well, we'll talk about it some more. We've run out of time. David Sinclair, thank you very much for joining us. SINCLAIR: Hey, thanks for having me. FLATOW: Dr. Sinclair is a professor in the Department of Genetic at Harvard Med School in Boston. We're going to take a break, and when we come back we're going to switch gears and take a closer look at bees - bumblebees, honeybees, you name it, bee-autiful, coming after this break. Stay with us.
