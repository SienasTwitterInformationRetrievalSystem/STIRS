This is either due to the aggravating circumstances of the offense or the celebrity’s subsequent fall from grace. Here are the most memorable celebrity DUI convictions that have left an indelible mark in pop culture: • Lindsay Lohan – there has been a lengthy history of DUI associated with this actress and socialite. In 2007, reports surfaced regarding Lohan driving under the influence of cocaine. She was sentenced to 90 days behind bars. • Jaime Pressley – was caught driving at nearly three times the legal limit. Her blood alcohol count measured .22 percent, and she later paid $390 in fees, as well as participated in a six-month drug alcohol program. • Keifer Sutherland – the “24” Star was found guilty of DUI in 2007, and infamously spent 48 days behind bars. • Bobby Brown – this year Bobby Brown made headlines for getting a 55 day sentence for DUI as well as an 18 month order to an alcohol education program. His time behind bars will commence in March of 2013. • Paris Hilton – was sentenced to 45 days in jail for violating an initial probation stemming from DUI. She was however released early due to good behavior. • Nicole Ritchie – Hilton’s former BFF was also arrested for DUI in 2007 after being caught driving on the opposite side of the freeway. Ritchie served a much shorter time behind bars with a mere four day sentence in jail. • Mel Gibson – in 2006 the talented producer and director was notoriously arrested for DUI, as well as declaring anti-semantic remarks at law enforcement. Even though there was no conviction made, the arrest was worth mentioning due to the much-talked about incident in the media – that’s still shown today. Gibson has had a slew of controversies in the last couple of years including domestic violence accusations. A skilled lawyer can arrange plea bargains for lower sentencing or prove a driver’s innocence. As an example, Heather Locklear was initially arrested for DUI, but further research from lawyers proved that the actress was under the influence of prescription drugs. Her case was plead down to a reckless driving offense, which carries lower fines. No one is exempt from the laws of the land, and all individuals also have the right to an attorney. If you’ve been arrested or accused of DUI, contact a criminal defense lawyer immediately.

Bobby Brown Gets 55-Day Jail Sentence for DUI - Celebrity Justice FindLaw | Find a Lawyer. Find Answers. Are you a legal Professional? Visit our professional site Learn about law firm marketing Learn About the Law Find a Lawyer FindLaw Answers Forms & Store News Blogs Search Bobby Brown Gets 55-Day Jail Sentence for DUI By Andrew Lu on February 27, 2013 10:20 AM It's Bobby Brown's prerogative to drive drunk. It's also a Los Angeles judge's prerogative to send Bobby Brown to jail for his DUI conviction last year. The 44-year-old singer will head to a county jail next month to begin serving his 55-day sentence for his second DUI conviction in less than a year, reports CNN. Brown's penalty may seem a bit harsh for drunk driving (especially for a celebrity); however, the singer was driving with a suspended license from a previous DUI arrest at the time. Brown entered a guilty plea of driving under the influence, driving on a suspended license, and violating probation from the earlier conviction. For his earlier DUI conviction, Brown also entered a plea deal and was able to avoid jail. Instead, he spent time in a "confidential rehabilitation center" and had to meet the terms of his probation that included not driving drunk, reports CNN. Brown will not get off so lucky this time around. Along with the 55-day jail sentence, Brown was also ordered to attend at least three Alcoholics Anonymous sessions each week until he begins his jail sentence on March 20. The 55-day jail sentence consists of ten days for the DUI, ten days for driving with a suspended license, and 35 days for violating probation. His probation was also extended for another four years. Had Brown not entered a plea deal for the DUI, he could have potentially faced much more severe penalties including up to a year in jail for the DUI. But Brown, like many other DUI defendants, entered into a plea deal to avoid the most serious penalties. For less serious DUI offenders (even repeat DUI offenders), prosecutors may be willing to enter a plea deal to save the time and money of litigating the case. And with the four-year probation for Bobby Brown, prosecutors can throw the book at the singer should he drive drunk again.
