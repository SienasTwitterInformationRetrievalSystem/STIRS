Celebrity News Mar. 6, 2013 AT 6:00AM By Kathleen Perricone, omg! staff Tweet Credit: Noel Vasquez/Getty Images Honey Boo Boo is not redneck-onizing the Girl Scout rules of cookie selling. Just days after the organization halted the reality star and her family from hawking Tagalongs, Thin Mints, and Savannah Smiles online via her Facebook page, the 7-year-old was back at it over the weekend… except this time, she was doing it old-school style: standing for hours inside a local mall. Honey Boo Boo (real name: Alana Thompson) and her family joined local Girl Scout troop No. 60373 at Georgia's Milledgeville Mall on Sunday to sell the $3.50 boxes of cookies. And the little beauty queen – who is not even a scout! – was working hard for the money, holding up signs to attract passersby and even posing for photos with fans (as long as they bought at least five boxes) all while chomping on a Ring Pop. As omg! previously reported, the Girl Scouts of the USA got involved last week after Honey Boo Boo was selling cookies on her Facebook page, which has more than 700,000 followers. Online sales are a direct violation of the GSUSA’s rules because “a girl doesn’t have the personal experience of asking someone to purchase her product,” the organization told omg! in a statement. “She doesn’t have to learn the responsibility of handling the money and personally delivering the order. When you have canvassed your neighborhood and manned cookie booths for hours, you learn the value of a hard day’s work. There is also a strong feeling of accomplishment when you are personally engaged in the activity." It looks like Honey Boo Boo and her Girl Scout friends are learning those skills now that they’ve taken their sales offline. The little star’s mother, June Shannon, told omg! that all she and her family had wanted was to help their local troop, and it looks like that’s what they’re now doing … this time, all within the GSUSA guidelines. “It has always been my family’s goal to give back and help others,” Mama June said at the time. “I have helped our family friend sell Girl Scout Cookies for the past three years. While Alana is not an official Girl Scout, we have followed all rules sent to us by the local council.” The GSUSA did not immediately respond to omg!’s request for comment on Honey Boo Boo’s latest cookie venture.

ABC News Blogs > Entertainment > Celebrities Celebrities Headlines Politics Entertainment Health Lifestyle Business Technology Girl Scouts Ask ‘Honey Boo Boo’ to Stop Cookie Sales   Email Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print By ABC News Mar 1, 2013 11:50am                                        (Noel Vasquez/Getty Images) The 7-year-old girl known as “Honey Boo Boo” has been selling Girl Scout cookies through Facebook, and upsetting the organization in the process. Alana “Honey Boo Boo” Thompson, the star of TLC’s “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,” posted a banner on her Facebook page advertising Girl Scout cookies. It featured a picture of her, and listed pricing and contact info for her 700,000-plus fans on the site. Honey Boo Boo, whose family lives in Georgia, is selling the cookies on behalf of a friend — and that’s a problem for the Girl Scouts of Historic Georgia, which asked her to take down the ad. RELATED: Honey Boo Boo’s Mom Bans ‘Crazy Tony’ From Show “What we felt was inappropriate is that it appeared that ‘Honey Boo Boo’ herself was selling the cookies, and she’s not a Girl Scout,” Debbie Caballero, a marketing and communications officer for the Girls Scouts of Historic Georgia, told ABC News Radio. Though the ad has been removed from the Facebook page, Honey Boo Boo’s mom, June Shannon, indicates that her family will continue to sell the cookies. Shannon, a.k.a. “Mama June,” told TMZ.com, “If I can raise more money for a troop, whoever they are, especially in an area where they don’t get a lot of money, and parents can’t afford to buy a ton of cookies, why wouldn’t I help?” RELATED: Adam Levine Rants Over ‘Honey Boo Boo’ SHOWS: Good Morning America   Email Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.

But the organization shut her down, claiming her online marketing was unfair. BY Margaret Eby NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Published: Wednesday, February 27, 2013, 7:13 PM Updated: Thursday, February 28, 2013, 3:11 PM A A A An ad posted on Facebook by Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson to sell Girl Scout cookies. Honey Boo Boo has her cookie-selling Girl Scout badge in the bag this year — or maybe not.  The 7-year-old TLC star, whose real name is Alana Thompson, had taken to her Facebook page to sell the iconic treats when the Girl Scouts of America shut down the tot's operation.  Thompson, who was offering to include her signature on each box of cookies sold, pulled the ad from the social media site after a Girl Scouts representative contacted her administrator.   According to TMZ, the GSUSA rep explained that online selling "defeats the whole purpose of selling the cookies." John Bazemore/AP Beauty pageant regular and reality show star Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson, 7, took to social media to help sell Girl Scout cookies for a friend, but her ad was shut down by the organization.  The "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" star, who has more than 700,000 followers Facebook, will deliver the orders that fans have already put in.  The website also reports that Thompson isn't even selling them for herself — the Samos and Thin Mints she peddled were to help out a friend. Looks like Thompson's going to have to do it the old-fashioned way instead.  Related Stories SEE IT: Honey Boo Boo's mom gets a makeover Honey Boo Boo's Mama June sheds 100 pounds Jennifer Lawrence blames car accident on Honey Boo Boo "); jQuery.getScript("http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"); OBR.extern.researchWidget(); console.log("GOOGLESURVEYDONE CALLED"); console.log("OBR.extern.researchWidget CALLED"); } Comments Post A Comment [ Discussion Guidelines] To Post Comments Sign In Editors' Picks ‘Bachelor’ and ‘Bachelorette’ former contestants now engaged: report Marcus Grodd didn't win Andi Dorfman's heart on "The Bachelorette," but he did apparently woo another bachelorette - one who was also turned down by "Bachelor" Juan Pablo Galavis.

As TMZ first reported, the Girl Scouts of the USA had a big problem with HBB using her Facebook page to peddle the delicious, delicious cookies -- because it was cheating. But the Boo Boo clan promised to keep on helping and they did just that, with the whole family in tow -- Sugar Bear, Chubbs, Pumpkin, Chickadee and baby Kaitlyn.  Alana even made a deal with customers ... agreeing to pose for a pic if they bought five boxes of those delicious, delicious cookies.

HBB posted the ad on her Facebook page -- which has 701,000 likes.  She also got in the girl scouts' faces by posting pictures of stacks of boxes that she sold.  FYI ... she's not selling the cookies for herself ... she's doing it for a friend. It didn't go down well with the organization.  A rep for GSUSA in Georgia tells TMZ ... they contacted her site's administrator and explained online selling is off-limits, because it defeats the whole purpose of selling the cookies -- to teach girls all sorts of things, including goal setting, people skills, etc. So HBB's people took down the ads, but get this ... the sales she's already made will be counted. If HBB wants to help her friend, she's gotta stand outside a whole bunch of Piggly Wigglys.

BB not bb     Not only are you not allowed to have someone else sell the cookies for you, you are not supposed to sell them in front of stores wither. troops do that but that is cheating. You are supposed to go door to door. I guess now with all of the paranoia, people don't like letting their girls go out to do that any more. I think the Girl Scouts shoudl offer a more healthy and natural product. They should have chemical free versions of their flavors, made with whole grain flours and unrefined sugars. Girls should learn about proper diet as well with the obesity and cancer epidemics running rampant. 511 days ago Reply     5 4 Clear Vote 10 RESPONSES ▼ Loading Replies... 8.

It's a different world we live in and you can never be too careful. My kid used to have chocolate bar fundraisers and it was a RULE that children NOT go door-to-door as a safety precaution. Besides as others have stated, I'm surprised the GSUSA are opposed to large amounts of money. Pretty biased though as they're allowing the existing sales to count. 511 days ago Reply     5 Clear Vote 13. Bruno     When you sign the cookie sales agreement, it specifically prohibits online sales. She cheated. Plain and simple.. 511 days ago Reply     3 4 Clear Vote 14. Sonja     So long as profits go to the Girl Scouts who cares? Fair?? Is there a prize or something for most cookies sold? What lessons do peddling these overpriced cookies really teach? How to accost people with barely enough money for groceries to pity the little girls and buy a $4 box of cookies instead of bread or milk at the doors of said grocery store?? Or how to spot a sexual predator based on how the person answering the door is dressed? Or who's parents have enough money to buy 20 boxes from their own kid? Times have changed, so long as proceeds are going where they should be I think the GS are just being haters. Online selling bad, soliciting at a store where soliciting is strictly prohibited is ok?.. sounds like the only lesson here is hypocrisy. 511 days ago Reply     8 1 Clear Vote 3 RESPONSES ▼ Loading Replies... 15. Wow ...     The girl scouts are suppose to teach honor, fairness and build character, etc. Having a 'friend' sell them isn't exactly fair, especially when a friend is a 'celebrity'. However, if the girl scouts wants to prepare their troops for the world, they should consider online sales. The net is here to stay.

In hopes of helping her local troop, the reality star tried peddling the treats on her Facebook page, until she was banned by the organization for not following the rules. Splash News The 7-year-old beauty queen and her family didn’t give up that easily, opting to go the more traditional route and sell the Thin Mints, Samoas and more at Georgia’s Milledgeville Mall. The in-person sales could put the TLC darling back in the Girl Scouts' good graces. The organization told omg! in a statement that when a scout sells online she "doesn’t have the personal experience of asking someone to purchase her product. She doesn’t have to learn the responsibility of handling the money and personally delivering the order." The statement continued, “When you have canvassed your neighborhood and manned cookie booths for hours, you learn the value of a hard day’s work. There is also a strong feeling of accomplishment when you are personally engaged in the activity." At the time of the ban, Mama June explained to omg!, “It has always been my family’s goal to give back and help others. I have helped our family friend sell Girl Scout Cookies for the past three years. While Alana is not an official Girl Scout, we have followed all rules sent to us by the local council.” Related Posts Rumor Control: Is Honey Boo Boo's Mom Joining 'DWTS'?
