Learn more » Tweet THE IMF has taken years to pluck up the courage to censure Argentina’s blatantly inaccurate inflation statistics, but it did so at last on February 1st. The official reprimand gives the government of President Cristina Fernández until September 29th to take “remedial measures” to comply with the fund’s rules on the reporting of statistics. If it fails to do so, Argentina risks escalating punishments, from losing its ability to borrow from the IMF to—eventually—expulsion. This is the first time the fund has reprimanded a country in this way since its rules on members’ statistics were tightened in 2004. It has only ever expelled one country—Czechoslovakia in 1954, ostensibly for failing to provide adequate statistics, though the cold war probably had more to do with it. In this section The man with the mighty microphone The last caudillo Motion of censure Out of stock Reprints Related topics Politics Argentina International Monetary Fund (IMF) World politics Latin American politics As so often, Argentina seems incapable of playing by the same rules as everyone else. Since the government seized control of the statistics institute in 2007 the discrepancy between the official inflation number and that reported by independent economists has been up to 15 percentage points (see chart). Doctoring the number saved the government some $2.5 billion in payments on index-linked debt, according to an estimate by Miguel Kiguel, an economist in Buenos Aires. Some Argentine economists also think that the government has bumped up figures for GDP growth by around two percentage points a year. But the subterfuge is wearing thin. Labour unions are angry that their wages are not being increased in line with true inflation. With wage claims pending and a congressional election due in October, this week the government announced that it has told supermarkets to freeze their prices for two months. Ms Fernández seems to have more stomach for the statistical fight than the IMF. She and her late husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner, blamed the fund for Argentina’s economic collapse in 2001, though it was the country’s own policies that were mainly responsible. They vowed never to submit to the IMF again. Responding to the censure, the government criticised the fund for applying “double standards” and favouring banks. It also linked the censure to Argentina’s battle with vulture funds, which bought its defaulted bonds and are suing for billions of dollars in a New York court. Behind the bluster, the government may be preparing a retreat. The New York case led to the seizure of an Argentine navy sailing ship last year. In a written filing to the court, the government offered to reopen its 2010 bond swap to the holdouts—a reversal of its previous position, written into law, that it would never do so. The inflation imbroglio may be harder to fix. The government is working on a new national consumer-price index, to start in the fourth quarter of this year—in effect, after the election. But that may not be enough to satisfy the IMF. It is likely to want Argentina to let its staff verify that the new methodology is in line with international standards. Ms Fernández is unlikely to accept that. The battle between Argentine nationalism and statistical rationality may be far from over.

The declaration of censure was adopted yesterday by the IMF’s 24-member board, the Washington-based fund said in a statement. While it doesn’t have immediate effects, the decision takes the country a step closer to sanctions that include being barred from access to IMF loans. The IMF’s executive board found that Argentina’s progress in implementing so-called remedial measures “has not been sufficient,” according to the statement. The board called on Argentina to “address the inaccuracy” of economic data no later than Sept. 29. Managing Director Christine Lagarde is required to report to the board on Argentina’s progress by Nov. 13. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said in 2010 the country would create a new consumer price index to reflect the latest consumption habits. Since then, the government hasn’t shown any progress in the new index. Lagarde said in September that the lender may give the country a “yellow card” for failing to improve its reports. Debt Default The fund’s censure is baseless and represents a “new mistake,” the country’s economy ministry said yesterday in a statement published on the government’s website. Argentina will start using a new CPI index by the fourth quarter of this year after conducting a survey on consumption since March 2012, according to the statement. “Argentina doesn’t seem to have this as a priority in its agenda,” said Miguel Kiguel, a former finance under-secretary who now runs Econviews in Buenos Aires. The U.S. Treasury voiced support for the IMF’s decision and urged “Argentina to work closely with the IMF in the months ahead to rectify these matters,” according to an e-mailed statement from Treasury spokeswoman Holly Shulman. Argentina has been blocked from borrowing from international markets since its 2001 default on $95 billion of debt. South America’s second-biggest economy needs new investments to finance increased oil production by YPF SA, the country’s largest oil company that Fernandez nationalized last year from Spain’s Repsol SA. IMF Censure The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine government dollar debt instead of Treasuries narrowed 44 basis points to 1,058 basis points at 5:17 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Argentina’s $37.6 billion of inflation-linked bonds, which account for 21 percent of government debt, have lost 19.1 percent in the past 12 months, the most in Latin America, according to Barclays Plc. Similar Brazilian bonds gained 11.5 percent in the same period, while Mexican inflation-linked bonds rose 17.2 percent. The IMF censure followed several attempts to obtain information from Argentina that the fund deems is good enough to monitor the country’s economic performance. Fernandez has denied the official statistics are inaccurate, even though they have been disputed by the IMF, economists and politicians since 2007. Further Sanctions In early 2007, Fernandez’s late husband and then-President Nestor Kirchner replaced senior staff at the statistics institute, known as Indec. While private forecasters estimate that inflation accelerated in 2012 to 25.6 percent, the government’s national statistics institute said consumer prices rose 10.8 percent. The private economists aren’t identified because they risk being fined by the government for releasing calculations that differ from official data. The gap between the official and private inflation rates has enabled the country to save about $6.8 billion since 2007, according to Buenos Aires-based research firm ACM Consultores. The IMF may take further sanctions, such as declaring the country ineligible to use the fund’s general resources and suspending its voting rights. “Compulsory withdrawal” is the last step of the procedure, which leaves time between each decision for the country to address concerns. According to the fund, Czechoslovakia is the only country ever ousted from the IMF for breaching the same rule, while Cuba withdrew in 1964. The procedure that has censure as a prior step didn’t exist then.

Argentina Freezes Supermarket Prices To Halt Soaring Inflation; Chaos To Follow Submitted by Tyler Durden on 02/04/2013 20:25 -0400   Up until now, Argentina's descent into a hyperinflationary basket case, with a crashing currency and loss of outside funding was relatively moderate and controlled. All this is about to change. Today, in a futile attempt to halt inflation, the government of Cristina Kirchner announced a two-month price freeze on supermarket products. The price freeze applies to every product in all of the nation’s largest supermarkets — a group including Walmart, Carrefour, Coto, Jumbo, Disco and other large chains. The companies’ trade group, representing 70 percent of the Argentine supermarket sector, reached the accord with Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno, the government’s news agency Telam reported. As AP reports, "The commerce ministry wants consumers to keep receipts and complain to a hotline about any price hikes they see before April 1." Perhaps they will. What consumers will certainly do is scramble into local stores to take advantage of artificially-controlled prices knowing very well they have two short months to stock up on perishable goods at today's prices, before the country's inflation comes soaring back, only this time many of the local stores will not be around as their profit margins implode and as owners, especially of foreign-based chains, make the prudent decision to get out of Dodge while the getting's good and before the next steps, including such measures as nationalization, in the escalation into a full out hyperinflationary collapse, are taken by Argentina's female ruler. As such expect photos of empty shelves from Buenos Aires to start popping up in a few days, comparable to how threats of a gun and weapon ban by the US government did more for the top and bottom line of US arms dealers than any military conflict ever could. Sure enough: Economist Soledad Perez Duhalde of the abeceb.com consulting firm predicted on Monday that the price freeze will have only a very short term effect, and noted that similar moves in Argentina had failed to control inflation. Consumers shouldn’t be surprised if the supermarkets are slow to restock their shelves and offer fewer products for sale, she added. In other news Argentina, just like the rest of the "developed" world, appears to have a slight inflation tracking problem: Polls show Argentines worry most about inflation, which private economists estimate could reach 30 percent this year. The government says it’s trying to hold the next union wage hikes to 20 percent, a figure that suggests how little anyone believes the official index that pegs annual inflation at just 10 percent. The BLS has the solution: just exclude any product whose price is rising from your CPI calculation, and voila. For everything else there is a hedonic adjustment. The ironic comparison to the US does not end there however: A more effective way to contain inflation would be to “reduce government spending, which is financing an expansion of the money supply, and to have a credible price index.” Wait, are they still talking about Argentina or the US? The government announced the price freeze on the first business day after the International Monetary Fund formally censured Argentina for putting out inaccurate economic data. The IMF has given Argentina until September to bring its inflation and economic growth statistics up to international standards. If Argentina doesn’t comply, it could face expulsion from the world body in November. Well good thing the US complies with the IMF's stringent "seasonally adjusted" data reporting quality control. Or else, the US may have been expelled from the IMF too. And then who would fund the creeping bailout of Europe (aside from Germany of course)? The IMF censure “is not just a new error ... it’s also a clear example of the organization’s unequal treatment and double standards in regard to certain member countries,” Lorenzino said. “Argentina, just as it agreed with the IMF to do, will keep working to improve its statistical procedures in accordance with good international standards.” So to summarize: first capital controls, then a currency crisis, then expectations of sovereign default, then a rise in military tensions, and finally - price controls, after which all out chaos usually follows. Study this sequence well: it is coming to every "developed" country near you in the months and years ahead. But, as with every other hyperinflationary implosion, there is a silver lining: the stock market is soaring... ... at least in Peso terms. When priced in USD, the 360% stock market "rise" is more like -9% in the past 21 years. But luckily, the general public has a gene that prevents it from grasping the difference between nominal and real - something Ben Bernanke is very well aware of.   » 73206 reads Printer-friendly version Send to friend - advertisements - Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Mon, 02/04/2013 - 23:08 | 3215324 disabledvet ponzi schemes can't survive the deflation. that's the lesson of Charles Ponzi, the lesson of Bernie Madoff. These clowns always have "some new interest rate product to sell." What they don't have an answer for is "prices decreasing." that means cash money itself is hoarded and people want to know "what your business is." in the case of say..."gold mining"....it would appear "very expensive rock farming." So Argentina is bouncing checks using its cash to do so. They don't call it fiat for nothing. People in Argentina running out and buying a boat load of canned goods says to me "these people need to get a life." Be like a good Bostonian and "buy a cow." that's why they had/have all those "commons" in Massachusetts. "So the cow would have some food."

Mon, 02/04/2013 - 21:44 | 3215162 RuiNsPro Argentina is a perfect case of how crappy this hyped-up "freegold" theory fares in the real world. It ain't pretty. Argentina has basically a 2-tier monetary system. Their government issues constantly depreciating PESO while their citizens choose to save in US$ or Euro knowing full well how weak PESO is. So Argentinians transact in a softer currency and save in a harder one - the freegold principles. You won't find "fisical prudence", "meritocracy" or whatever beautiful promises these FGers are selling around in Argentina. What you do see is a PESO 20000 to 1 (or so) reverse split every 10-20 years after being printed completely outta shape. Their economy is in perrenial deep sh*t b/c of the currency meltdown. Mon, 02/04/2013 - 22:52 | 3215289 StychoKiller Erm, please to explain HOW printing all those pesos is in the common interest. Mon, 02/04/2013 - 22:59 | 3215304 RuiNsPro Printing money (in this case PESO) is to benefit politicians that want to spend the money they don't have or bankers that need the fast & furious supply of papers to propel their bubble games. It's not in the common interest. It's in the elites' interest only be it in Argentina, US, Europe, Zimbabwe or anywhere.

Mon, 02/04/2013 - 23:35 | 3215397 Poor Grogman The only difference between freegold and Argentina's situation at present is that the FG'ers won't allow you to lend your gold. No I am serious, that is their official retarded statist position. In other words Freegold = controlled hyperinflation. Now who would that benefit most in society? surely not the 1% who could borrow whatever they wish, using pretend collateral, ( not their gold) and then inflate it away while the peasants starve in the empty supermarkets? Tue, 02/05/2013 - 08:21 | 3215838 Babushka So as I've understood in freegold theory you transact in whatever fiat but save in phisical gold... And you are saing:Their government issues constantly depreciating PESO while their citizens choose to save in US$ or Euro knowing full well how weak PESO is. So Argentinians transact in a softer currency and save in a harder one - the freegold principles. Accordingly to you idea USD and Euro is equal gold (which is not). Get your basics together mate!

Mon, 02/04/2013 - 22:23 | 3215237 Acet Dude, you have no idea what you're talking about. Brasil was right wing all the way for decades and it remained a real shithole the whole time. It only ever came out of its slumber because a leftist government was elected and they introduced things like conditional help for the poor (the condition being that they sent their kids to school). Before Lula, the country had only 2 classes, rich and poor - no middle class - and now it actually is growing a middle class. Oh and by the way, your Google translated bullshit doesn't sound correct in Portuguese. Amongst other things, there is no such expression as "free lunch" in Portuguese. I see that the brainwashed, politically limited, ignorant American segment of this site is out in force today. Mon, 02/04/2013 - 23:19 | 3215350 disabledvet this is what happens when you discover that "worthless pampas" is in fact a gold mine:http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/34756116-1333-11e2-ac28-00144feabdc0.html those rates went from 15% to 7.25% in only 15 months. sound money obviously had a lot to do with it...but also discovering more land than imaginable and created a "live able society." stop paying your taxes America (save for Social Security.)http://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/central-banks/central-bank-br... clearly we have a first world economy here...and these rates are happening in spite of the massive spending for the (rigged) Olympic Games coming up.

Tue, 02/05/2013 - 02:38 | 3215674 ersatzteil I don't see how you consider Brazil, an economic powerhouse with a growing middle class despite widespread inequality is some leftist paradise comparable to France, a European social democracy with neo-colonial military ventures. The right-wing governments of Brazil's past did a great job laying the foundations of a thriving aerospace and auto industry. But labor laws were virtually non-existant and little was done to combat the old vestiges of racism and class stratification. Lula brought a voice to labor; capital is still dominant in the struggle, but modern reforms have given the middle class a chance to grow and take a voice in Brazil's future. I don't see what is so leftist about that. Tue, 02/05/2013 - 02:10 | 3215636 ersatzteil Neither does the word "Brazilians". But really, Brasil is looking better every day; it would be a blast to live there if it wasn't for the damn difficult visa issues, courtesy of our own US State Department's insistence on making visas difficult for Brasileiros. Diplomatic reciprocity is a bitch. Tue, 02/05/2013 - 04:26 | 3215718 TWSceptic You're wrong of course. It's not socialist ideas that helped Brasil. It's capitalism, and more freedom. It's funny that whenever a country improves economically and becomes more prosperous, socialists try to claim that it's a result of their ideology. The reality is that socialism and corporatism only slow economic growth. And this is exactly what is happening in Brasil if you would pay better attention. The full potential of Brasil is not reached, it's still being hold back by stupid regulation and many stupid taxes. Socialism is NOT helping the poor, it's keeping them poor. You can apply that last statement to yourself, silly rabbit.   Tue, 02/05/2013 - 07:12 | 3215773 Acet It was a mix of both. Lula had policies which were a mix of Capitalism and Socialism. Certainly the condicional help for the poor as long as they sent their kids to school thing is not something you would see in a purelly Capitalist system. Brasil tried pure Capitalism for decades and it didn't work - it just created this incredibly unequal society with high crime and low productivity. It was the mix of both systems that got the country in the path of growth. To me this makes sense, since Capitalism on its own does not have solutions for the poverty trap problem (quite the contrary, it's riddled with feedback cycles where having capital and connections trumps having skill and ability) so potentially highly productive members of society - think a new Einstein - are born in poverty, never get an education, never get a real chance and thus never reach their potential, which is bad for them and bad for society as a whole (since this is multiplied by 100s of thousands). The whole thing wouldn't have worked if he had tried Marxism V2, nor did it work before when the country tried American style Capitalism.     [PS: Just re-read your comment and your argument is a bit of a caricature of itself. Here's one of your sentences, with a slight change "It's funny that whenever a country improves economically and becomes more prosperous, capitalists try to claim that it's a result of their ideology" By the way, I'm neither socialist nor capitalist, just a guy that thinks for himself and tries to find his own way - it usually looks surprisingly like a balanced mix of policies - rather than regurgitate somebody else's ideas and going around accusing people of being {INSERT CONTRARY POLITICAL AFFILIATION HERE}] [PPS: Didn't downtick you - gotta respect somebody else's ideas, even if they sound like they lack a propert foundation of really thinking hard about things] [PPPS: By the way, you misspelled skeptic in your avatar name] Mon, 02/04/2013 - 23:57 | 3215449 chdwlch1 How many is a BRAZILLION?  Does that come after QUDRILLION? Oh well, I guess we'll all find out soon enough...FUCK YOU BERNANKE!!!

Overall, it's a good place to be when TSHTF. There may not be a better prepared population on Earth. They probably have the natural resources and industrial base to make it on their own, too.  There are worse place to be these days.

Please try again. A woman walks past a supermarket with a sign advertising discounts on meat in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Thursday, Jan. 17, 2013. (Photo: AP) (TheBlaze/AP) — Argentina announced a two-month price freeze on supermarket products Monday in an effort to stop spiraling inflation. The price freeze applies to every product in all of the nation’s largest supermarkets – a group including Walmart, Carrefour, Coto, Jumbo, Disco and other large chains. The companies’ trade group, representing 70 percent of the Argentine supermarket sector, reached the accord with Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno, the government’s news agency Telam reported. The commerce ministry wants consumers to keep receipts and complain to a hotline about any price hikes they see before April 1. Polls show Argentines worry most about inflation, which private economists estimate could reach 30 percent this year. The government says it’s trying to hold the next union wage hikes to 20 percent, a figure that suggests how little anyone believes the official index that pegs annual inflation at just 10 percent. Economist Soledad Perez Duhalde of the abeceb.com consulting firm predicted on Monday that the price freeze will have only a very short term effect, noting that similar moves in Argentina have failed to control inflation in the past. Consumers shouldn’t be surprised if the supermarkets are slow to restock their shelves and offer fewer products for sale, she added. A more effective way to contain inflation would be to “reduce government spending, which is financing an expansion of the money supply, and to have a credible price index.” Argentina’s President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner delivers a speech during a ceremony at the Casa Rosada on December 27, 2012 in Buenos Aires. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) The government announced the price freeze on the first business day after the International Monetary Fund formally censured Argentina for putting out inaccurate economic data. The IMF has given Argentina until September to bring its inflation and economic growth statistics up to international standards. If Argentina doesn’t comply, it could face expulsion from the world body in November. President Cristina Fernandez and her economy minister, Hernan Lorenzino, responded over the weekend with a flurry of attacks on the IMF, saying the agency’s data-gathering efforts had lost credibility in the lead-up to Argentina’s historic 2001 debt default. They said IMF advice also is leading Europeans astray by favoring big banks over measures that can grow economies out of crisis. However, Lorenzino also said that the government will begin using a new inflation index starting in fourth-quarter 2013 – just in time for the IMF’s decision. The IMF censure “is not just a new error … it’s also a clear example of the organization’s unequal treatment and double standards in regard to certain member countries,” Lorenzino said. “Argentina, just as it agreed with the IMF to do, will keep working to improve its statistical procedures in accordance with good international standards.” “Later this year, the new General Household Spending Survey will enable the tracking of spending in Argentine households nationwide” and generate a new national consumer price index whose design was agreed to by IMF technical experts, he said. – Related: Inflation: Why $5 Gas Could Be a Reality Bernanke Admits: Inflation Rising Why Inflation Hurts More Than it Did 30 Years Ago 174 Shares Share This Tweet This Email this story to a friend Your email was sent' + response.errors + 'Your email didn\'t send.

Slate If You Want To See What a Supply-Constrained Economy Looks Like, Check Out Argentina Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Moneybox A blog about business and economics. Feb. 5 2013 9:57 AM If You Want To See What a Supply-Constrained Economy Looks Like, Check Out Argentina By Matthew Yglesias   Argentina has a lot of inflation right now Photo by Pablo Porciuncula/AFP/Getty Images Countries facing persistent demand shortfalls could learn a lot from Argentina's basically successful default and devaluation, but now, more than a decade later, the country is facing very different problems. Specifically, the inflation rate is high and rising, and the government is trying to constrain it with gimmicks that aren't going to work. The small gimmick of de facto price controls on Big Macs didn't work, and imposing de jure price controls on supermarkets isn't going to work either. There are basically two ways you can reduce inflation. One is to implement tighter monetary policy to reduce the nominal growth rate of the economy. The other is to implement structural reforms that increase the productivity of your economy so that a larger share of nominal growth is real output and a smaller share is inflation. Argentina has a lot of inflation right now, so it probably needs some of both. Countries that get into inflationary spirals tend to struggle with them, since the political temptation to try to address it with gimmicks seems strong. That was the experience of the Nixon and Ford administrations in the United States, and it certainly seems to be the experience of the Kirchner administration in Argentina. But the evidence from the Volcker deflation in the United States and concurrent developments in Europe is that it isn't particularly difficult to implement a tighter money regime, you just need to decide you really want to do it. Advertisement For the developed world, I think the main lesson of Argentina should be that this is what a supply-constrained economy looks like. No country has optimal public policy, and today would be as good a day as any for America or any other country to implement policies that boost long-term growth potential. But a country whose primary immediate problem is on the supply side should look like Argentina, with high and rising inflation. Demand is chasing a fixed supply, so prices are accelerating. The USA since the crisis doesn't look like that at all—it's a place where both real output and the price level are below their pre-crisis trend because we have a demand shortfall.
