The Motor City is the largest district in the nation to have its voters and elected officials sidelined by this new experiment in "crisis management." Michigan residents might be wondering how this EFM got appointed. Didn’t they roundly reject financial managers in a statewide referendum in November? Michigan residents voted to repeal the EFM law by 53-47 percent after 200,000 people signed a petition to put the issue on the ballot. But this outburst of democracy didn't stop the Republican-controlled legislature and Governor Rick Snyder from ramming through a new law to do the exact same thing during a lame-duck legislative session a month later. Detroit's new EFM is Kevyn Orr, a prominent bankruptcy lawyer who worked on the massive Chrysler restructuring in 2009 with the Washington, DC law firm Jones Day. Orr has his work cut out for him if he wants to win over the community. Many Detroit residents are vowing continued protests and resistance to the takeover, saying that taking away democratic governance is not the way to fix the serious financial challenges the city faces. Undemocratic EFM Law Defeated at the Polls After the EFM law was repealed in November, a new version of the law was passed and put on the governor's desk within 37 days. The new bill included many of the same extensive powers that voters rejected at the polls. This time the lame-duck legislature added a $700,000 appropriation, making the law immune to another veto referendum. (The same lame-duck session rammed an ALEC-inspired union-busting "right to work" bill through despite public outcry and massive protests.) Technically, the new EFM law will not go into effect for another few days. An existing law from 1990 provided the legal justification for Orr's appointment, but the new, superseding law will greatly expand the powers the state's EFMs have. Under the new law, EFMs replace the Mayor and the City Council and can "exercise any power or authority of any officer, employee, department, board, commission or other similar entity of the local government whether elected or appointed." EFMs can modify, reject, or terminate any contract at any time for any reason, including with public employee unions. They can sell public assets (other than utilities), take the city into bankruptcy with the approval of the governor, and can even ban any individual who does not comply with orders from government buildings and communications. EFM as a Civil Rights Issue Today, six cities and 9 percent of Michigan residents are being governed by an appointed EFM and are no longer represented by the local officials they democratically elected. While only a portion of Michigan residents are being disenfranchised in this way, these EFM take-overs disproportionately affect Michigan's African-American communities. A whopping 49 percent of Michigan's African-American residents are now under the rule of appointed EFMs, raising questions about the civil rights implications of the law. Longtime Detroit Representative John Conyers asked the Washington Post, "How come all of the jurisdictions put under emergency management are majority African American? Has anybody noticed that? There seems to be a racial aspect, a racial component of the application of this law." Reverend Wendell Anthony, pastor of Detroit's Fellowship Chapel lamented, "It is the civil rights issue of our time. I didn't vote for an emergency manager. I voted for a mayor. I did not give up my right to vote on the whims and fancies of a law that we believe is unconstitutional and immoral. We view it as another step in the direction of voter suppression and vote oppression." Opponents of the appointment of the EFM in Detroit have picketed press conferences and have garnered national attention by driving along some of Detroit's busiest highways at painfully slow speeds during rush hour. Stephen Boyle of the group FREE Detroit - NO Consent explained the reason behind the actions, which are being referred to as "the slowdown in Motown": "If we slow down traffic, maybe people will stop and listen for a moment, as to what's going on. This isn't business as usual." EFM Law Pushed by Mackinac Center As early as 2005, the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, an influential right-wing think tank in Michigan has called for emergency managers as a way of breaking public employee contracts and lowering wages for public workers. The Mackinac Center is a member of the State Policy Network and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and has been funded by a number of right-wing foundations including the Dow Foundation, the Bradley Foundation, the Walton Foundation, the DeVos Foundation, and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation. Louis Schimmel, a former Mackinac employee who penned reports and articles on EFMs, was appointed the EFM of Pontiac, Michigan by the Governor Snyder in 2011. Schimmel "pursued the most aggressive turnaround plan in the state," according to Mother Jones. Schimmel proposed putting nearly every city property up for sale, "including city hall, the police station, fire stations, water-pumping stations, the library, the golf course, and two cemeteries," but Pontiac still faced a huge shortfall in 2012. Will It Work? There is at least one thing people agree on; Detroit is not doing well. Deindustrialization and the offshoring of manufacturing jobs led to high unemployment, loss of revenue for the city and public school systems, increases in crime, white flight from the city to better-off suburbs, and a snowball effect that has left Detroit a shell of its former self, with half its former population and with $14 billion in long-term liabilities. Increased revenue sharing and long term strategies are needed to rebuild the hollowed out city. While Detroit's Mayor is characterizing the appointment of an emergency manager as an "opportunity" for the city, others are not so sure. "It is difficult to identify a single instance where an emergency manager has succeeded in turning around the financial fortunes of a city or jurisdiction. The history of the emergency manager law in Michigan is replete with fiscal mismanagement and conflicts of interest," says Rep. Conyers who is demanding a federal audit of Michigan EFMs. "In the absence of any sort of checks or balances at the state level, it is vital that the GAO examine the law and its impact, particularly the impact on federal funding." Unions and others are prepping lawsuits to challenge the new law. Even though Orr is being touted as a professional and being paid a salary of some $275,000 a year, he is already off to a rocky start. Reporters discovered that he owed over $10,000 for tax liens on his $1 million home in Maryland. Orr paid the balance and called the situation "remarkably embarrassing," but the Reverend Charles Williams II, president of the National Action Network of Michigan, noted: "It is quite interesting that (Orr) feels he could manage the city of Detroit, and he's having trouble managing his own affairs."

Democracy Economy Real Economy Project News Add new comment Printer-friendly version 13538 reads Comments Detroit Finances Posted by Old Toad (not verified) on March 25, 2013 - 9:04am I agree with the article author. Let those good folks of Detroit work their own way out of the situation they got themselves into. After all this is just civil rights. Let the union members run the show. Good luck. reply Ballooning costs Posted by Inside the beltway (not verified) on March 25, 2013 - 10:26am One thing I think should be recognized is the fact that when the tax base moves out into the suburbs they leave the residents holding the bag. The city has to appropriate a lot of money to sustain a large population. There are cost that the suburbs do not bear. Much of the money generated in the city also moves into the burbs. This is true for all cities. When all that is left is the poorer people it is difficult to see the kinds of revenues that make the city thrive. Detroit public workers do not make more than the public workers in the suburbs, but the taxes per resident is not on par. It's worng to blame the poor because they have to subsidize a large city by themselves and they don't make the salaries the suburbian residents do. Bringing in an outside consultant doesn't change that. reply Come-on, the "tax-base" Posted by Tim Tyler (not verified) on March 25, 2013 - 5:26pm Come-on, the "tax-base" (read: middle-class, educated white people) FLED the city to the suburbs in the 1950s & 1960s. Remember, Coleman Young tried to blame 'white flight' on the highway system, decades ago! The reality is that intelligent people of all races, mostly white, started to get the hell out of the city because they correctly saw where Detroit was heading. The majority of the people who were left did & do not value education. The lucky ones got union jobs, and many of those workers fled the city once they could afford to do so, as-did many of the union & non-union businesses. Detroit has been a cesspool since the early 1970s, when the residents decided it was more important for their elected officials & other city leadership to be black than to be competent, decent, educated people. Sadly, that's still the case (can you imagine the uproar if the Emergency Financial Manager was white?), and Detroiters richly deserve the situation that they are currently in (& have basically been in for at least 3 decades). reply Black Vs. Competent Posted by Judi Briggs (not verified) on March 26, 2013 - 7:08pm So, as I understand what you're saying, the opposite of black is competent, educated and decent? Really? reply Black Vs. Competent Posted by cloudsandskye (not verified) on April 3, 2013 - 11:22am No, that's not what he is saying. What he is saying is that the black voters of Detroit placed a higher priority on the race of election candidates than on the competency and qualifications of those candidates. They elected people over and over based on race, instead of competency. So, they got what they deserved, which was a legacy of incompetent, corrupt elected officials, ultimately leading to the situation they find themselves in now. reply And when they do Posted by SmilingAhab (not verified) on March 25, 2013 - 9:06pm They form worker's cooperatives, which have all of the decision making and none of the shareholders. They've been doing well in the wake of being abandoned. As well, your contempt for an entire city's worth of people and your implication that the manufacturing heart of the USA abscessed because people refused to live like serfs in a company town is heartless and crude. reply This is not what democracy looks like Posted by CheekyGirl (not verified) on March 25, 2013 - 3:37pm Can't they argue -- all of the municipalities, that this is also taxation without representation? Funny how all of the places where the Governor has chosen to impose the emergency manager 'law' are predominantly African American communities. Time for a revolution -- and constitutional challenge reply This is NOT how a democracy Posted by Anonymous (not verified) on March 25, 2013 - 3:45pm This is NOT how a democracy functions! These right wing extremists are constantly talking about our founding fathers. The founding fathers would be up in arms over this. reply What would happen if everyone Posted by Jean Netherton (not verified) on March 25, 2013 - 4:03pm What would happen if everyone simply ignored him? If the police just went about their business. If the guards didn't stop people who would normally be in the building. If notices of city meetings still got printed and attended. If the city treasurer continued to send out checks. And if the citizenry made sure that the local bank the city did business with made it clear to that bank that this manager's signature needed special handling - in the 'I am sure it is here somewhere' folder. What would happen? reply How is it Constitutional to subvert public elections? Posted by Shea Joy (not verified) on March 25, 2013 - 4:07pm No matter how bad the finances of Detroit are, the Governor of Michigan and his Teabagger Republicans surely cannot legally set aside elected officials. we need a comprehensive voting act to ban actions like this, gerrymandering, and other attempts to deny voter rights. All Americans ought to be able to get behind such a law. In this particular case, it's hard for me to believe that should a suit be brought before the Supreme Court (much less lower courts), the Michigan EFM law would not be ruled unconstitutional. There is a racist dynamic going on. If white and/or wealthier citizens have fled Detroit, it falls to the state to help pick up some of the bills. My sympathies are with the residents of this great American city. reply Pages 1 2 next › last » The Kochs' Anti-Civil Rights Roots: New Docs Expose Charles Koch's Ties to John Birch Society Latest News Shocker!

Rick Snyder Posted: 03/14/2013 2:17 pm EDT  |  Updated: 03/15/2013 6:57 am EDT reddit stumble Get Detroit Newsletters: Subscribe Follow:  Video, Kevin Or, Kevin Orr, Kevin Orr Detroit, Kevyn Orr, Kevyn Orr Detroit, Kevyn Orr Detroit Emergency Manager, Kevyn Orr Emergency Manager, Kevyn Orr Rick Snyder, Detroit News Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder recommended Kevyn Orr, a bankruptcy lawyer with the firm Jones Day in Washington DC, to become Detroit's emergency financial manager on Thursday, March 14, 2013 (Courtesy Jones Day). Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has been considerably tight-lipped about his pick for Detroit's emergency financial manager. But on Thursday he finally ended intense media speculation by recommending Kevyn Orr, a partner with the Jones Day law firm, for the position. On Thursday, Snyder reiterated his belief that the city of Detroit was in a financial emergency and introduced Orr as his recommendation for the city's emergency manager. "The prime obligation is going to be providing services to the city of Detroit," Orr said. "Everything is going to be on the table [for cuts] but it's going to be driven by the data and the need, [not used punitively]." Orr, 55, is an attorney with the firm's Washington D.C. office who helped guide Chrysler through its successful 2009 restructuring. He's a specialist in bankruptcy with over four decades expertise in financial restructuring and commercial litigation who holds membership with the American Bar Association, the Florida and Washington D.C. bars and the American Bankruptcy Institute. Between 1995 and 2001, he also served as the director and deputy director of the Executive Office for United States Trustees, a division of the U.S. Department of Justice in charge of overseeing the administration of bankruptcy cases and private trustees. "This is the Olympics of restructuring," Orr said. "If we can do this, I will have participated in one of the greatest turnarounds in the history of this country." Jones Day, based in Cleveland, is the same firm Mayor Dave Bing recently chose to fill the role of the city's restructuring counsel. But Orr said Thursday he would take steps to avoid any possible conflict of interest. "I am resigning from my law firm effective yesterday," he said. Mayor Dave Bing joined Snyder and Orr at Thursday's press conference. "There's no doubt in my mind that we're going to work well together," he said. Orr expressed a similar interest to work with Snyder, Bing and City Council. He reiterated that he's not an elected official, but an expert on the financial side. Although Orr hails from Florida, he does have a Michigan connection. He attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he completed his bachelor's and law school degrees. He's also an African-American, which could end up being a significant factor in Detroit, a majority African-American city where the idea of the governor appointing an emergency manager has met strong resistance with the city of 700,000. Orr said his experience as a bankruptcy lawyer has "inoculated" him to the negative reactions his presence can cause. At Thursday's meeting, he identified himself as a Democrat. "I was compelled to undertake this endeavor," Orr said. "As the Detroit motto says, 'we can rise from the ashes.'" UPDATE: 3:25 p.m. -- Michigan's Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board voted 3-0 to instate Kevyn Orr as Detroit's emergency financial manager. He will make a salary of $275,000, paid by the state, and start the position on March 25. Also on HuffPost: Loading Slideshow Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder Gov. Snyder had campaigned aggressively for Michigan voters to keep PA 4, the emergency manager law. After it was repealed, a similar law was passed through (along with right-to-work and other legislation) in December. In a Nov 2012 interview with The Huffington Post, Gov. Rick Snyder argued against cities in Michigan like Detroit filing for bankruptcy. "Theoretically, if you were able to do Chapter 9 in an efficient fashion, in a structured fashion, where you had everything lined up, you could actually address some of those issues, probably in a more total approach. But the track record, so far, has been pretty dismal. And the associating stigma of what it does, trying to get people to go there in the interim, is even worse." Andy Dillon, Treasurer, State of Michigan Dillon headed the six-member financial review team which declared the city in a state of emergency. <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130219/METRO01/302190407">At a press conference</a> to announce the team's findings, Dillon said, "We believe there's a financial emergency in the city and that there's no plan in place to correct the situation." "We gave the city every chance to avoid the outcome we're recommending to the governor today." Detroit Mayor Dave Bing An hour after a state-appointed financial review team unanimously declared that the city of Detroit was in a state of financial emergency, Mayor Dave Bing issued a statement that began with an admission that, yes, the city's finances are in a poor state. "Certainly I am not surprised by the findings of the State’s financial review team. My Administration has been saying for the past four years that the City is under financial stress. If the Governor decides to appoint an Emergency Financial Manager, he or she, like my Administration, is going to need resources -- particularly in the form of cash and additional staff." State Senator Coleman A. Young II Young issued this statement following the state review team's findings. “This is going to be a usurping of our democracy. I feel this was a set-up from the word go. If the State listened to reform measures suggested by citizens in the City of Detroit, we would not be in this situation. How can the State fix something they are culpable for? I am as outraged as I am heartbroken about this systematic dismantling and take-over of our City. The people will not let this stand, nor will I.” Charles Pugh, Detroit City Council President In 2011, Pugh said that city officials had the power to fix the city's finances. "“Talking about an emergency manager is a waste of breath,” <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2011/11/detroit_city_council_president_5.html">Pugh told MLive.</a> “We don’t need it. We’re working on a plan.” State Sen. Bert Johnson, D-Detroit In an <a href="http://www.mlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/09/michigan_decides_2012_guest_co.html">editorial written in Sept. 2012 for MLive.com</a>, Sen. Bert Johnson urged Michiganders to vote "no" on the referendum over PA 4, the emergency manager law. "The presence of an EM eliminates, for the duration of the appointment, the rights of voters to elect local officials and displaces them at the time of the appointment. Governments occupied by an EM are inevitably subject to new costs and expenses, forced upon them by the state, without access to new revenue. Simply put, EMs are undemocratic individuals who can singlehandedly craft new laws and operate as an unfunded mandate on local government. PA 4 is unconstitutional and a slap in the face to our Founding Fathers." L. Brooks Patterson, Oakland County Executive At a Detroit Economic Club panel held during the 2013 NAIAS that included southeast Michigan's four most prominent political leaders, L Brooks Patterson told the crowd that an EM in Detroit was needed to start "kicking ass and taking names." He also said that <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2013/01/l_brooks_patterson_emergency_m.html">an EM was preferable</a> to the city going through bankruptcy. "You don't want to go through bankruptcy," Patterson said, according to MLive. "You're going to get some judge in Atlanta or somewhere who knows nothing about the region calling the shots." Jo Ann Watson, Detroit City Councilmember In a <a href="http://www.detroitmi.gov/CityCouncil/CouncilMemberJoAnnWatson/NewsReleasesandStatements.aspx">Jan. 2012 letter authored by Watson</a>, who has vigorously opposed the appointment of an EM, she offered many suggestions for lowering Detroit's debt. They included a bailout, renegotiating debt service payments and demanding that banks be held legally and fiscally responsible for issuing subprime mortgages that contributed to foreclosures in the city. "Public Act 4 joins the infamous litany of racist, repressive, right-wing, undemocratic policies that challenge the very framework of the Constitution of the United States," she wrote. Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon Napoleon has formed an exploratory committee in regards to running for mayor of Detroit in 2013, but has not formally declared his candidacy. He issued a statement following the review team's findings, which included this text. “The worst kept secret in Detroit has been that the financial review team would likely come back with a report that recommends that an emergency financial manager be appointed here in Detroit. “I firmly believe that each and every community has a right to elect local leadership to address that community’s problem and I campaigned to repeal Public Act 4 with that belief,” he said. “That said, it is incumbent upon the local officials to recognize that there is a problem; how dire that problem is; and to make the tough decisions to address them. We have not done that here in Detroit, which is why we are having this conversation today." Gary Brown, Detroit City Council President Pro Tem Brown issued a written statement following the review team's findings. In part, he said the pace of change in Detroit<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/19/detroit-financial-emergency-state-review-team_n_2719112.html"> has been too slow.</a> "The political will has often not been there to make the necessary and bold fiscal reforms.. Without a doubt, we need the support and accountability that a State of Michigan partnership offers. We cannot address our legacy obligations alone. And, as Detroit goes, so goes Michigan."

Support mounted after the March 14 appointment of bankruptcy attorney Kevyn Orr as EFM of Detroit. “We’re looking at legal challenges in federal court and we expect that the Sugar Law Center or other groups will be filing such a challenge,” Attorney John Philo of the Sugar Law Center told the Michigan Citizen. Philo would not say when the claim would be filed. On March 18, during a press conference at Bethel Baptist Church East, the Council of Black Pastors announced it was joining the group of unions, including AFSCME Council 25 and the UAW, Detroit Branch NAACP and others. Rev. Michael Owens, president of the Council, called the appointment “undemocratic.” “We can’t afford to have Detroit be a success story for those hell-bent on our disenfranchisement through a disregard of home rule and the abolishment of voting rights,” Owens said. Meanwhile, activists continue to conduct what they call the “slowdown in Motown,” a traffic blockage on I-94, the Lodge expressway and I-75. Lining up three abreast to cover each lane of the highway, with flashers going, the protestors travel at 5-15 miles an hour “stopping commerce” in Detroit, according to Rev. D. Alexander Bullock, chair of Detroit Chapter Operation PUSH and the Rev. Charles Williams, chair of Detroit chapter National Action Network. In a two-page press statement titled “Democracy Under Siege!”, issued the day following the announcement of Jones Day Law Firm partner Kevyn Orr as Detroit’s EFM, Detroit Branch NAACP President Wendell Anthony wrote: “Mr. Kevyn Orr has credentials that any mother or father would be most proud to claim for their own. It is not the man, it is the plan and the process by which he has arrived in town. Lest we forget, 2.3 million Michiganders, by a margin of 52 percent, voted to repeal Public Act 4!” Anthony equated the law to a modern-day poll tax. “Our right to elect public officials to represent our community should not be traded on the bargaining table of economic distress. For many, this is a new poll tax,” Anthony wrote. “One can simply make the argument that based upon your inability to pay your bills, you should, in fact, lose your right to engage in the electoral privileges of our nation.” Conflicts of interest Anthony also pointed out the conflicts of interest of Orr and Jones Day in representing the city. Mayor Dave Bing, who welcomed the appointment of an EFM, announced two days before Orr’s appointment that the city had contracted with Jones Day to assist in the restructuring of the city’s financing. “Mr. Orr represents Wells Fargo — one of the nation’s largest banks engaged in foreclosures in the United States. At least 7,800 foreclosures are occurring right now on Wayne County’s new list,” Anthony wrote. “Mr. Orr represents the Amway Corporation, in which Richard DeVos, a founder, was a lead voice in implementing the right-to-work effort which is now law in the state of Michigan. Amway was also one of Gov. Snyder’s biggest campaign contributors (see Michigan Citizen March 17 issue, “Conflicts of interest in ‘restructuring’ choices”). Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsch Banke AG, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., Wells Fargo, Lehman Brothers and LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) are among large financial institutions that are Jones Day clients. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and LIBOR are also a few of the institutions to which the city is indebted. During the press conference announcing Orr’s appointment, this reporter queried Orr regarding the potential conflict. Orr responded that he planned to resign from the firm effective the next day to “rid of any impropriety.” Orr’s resignation has yet to be confirmed by the Michigan Citizen. Calls and e-mails to the governor’s office to interview Orr have gone unanswered. Jones Day did not respond by press time. Even if Orr resigns, it is unclear whether the conflict will have been eliminated. If he has a retirement plan with the firm — i.e., pension , 401K, share of profits or other benefits — then he continues to have a vested interest in the financial well-being of the firm. Although Philo could not offer a legal opinion on the potential conflict of interest, he says it raises very serious questions. “There’s the appearance of conflict,” Philo said. “The appointment raises a lot of questions with Jones Day representing Bank of America on the other side of credit swaps of the city.” Calls to the American Bar Association and legal experts to confirm the continued conflict were not returned by press time. Early start date raises questions PA 436 goes into effect March 28, three days after Orr’s first day at work. The March 25 start day has eliminated the city’s ability to choose options allowed under 436: have an emergency manager, request mediation, file bankruptcy or enter into a consent agreement with the state. Gov. Snyder signed PA 436 into law just over a month after its predecessor, PA 4, was repealed. More than 50 percent of Michiganders and over 80 percent of Detroiters voted against the law. Some say the new law mirrors PA 4 in that it gives an EFM the ability to fire elected officials, end collective bargaining and file bankruptcy on behalf of the city. Rev. Bullock, who worked with others to repeal what many called the “dictator law,” says Gov. Snyder’s administration has ignored the will of the people. “We voted emergency management down in November and they enacted a mirror law. They claim the new law would give the city options and then they maneuvered the EFM in early so those options aren’t available. It’s a state takeover of the city of Detroit,” Bullock said in a telephone interview. “It’s a continued side-stepping of the democratic process. And to bring Orr in early and grandfather him in under the new law continues to represent how Gov. Snyder’s administration continues to ignore the will of the people.” Further, Bullock said the claim that Orr will be gone in 18 months or less “doesn’t ring true.” Elected officials decry appoint of EFM in Detroit As this paper went to press, over 20 elected officials across the state held a press conference denouncing Gov. Snyder’s policy for failing cities. The representatives were from municipalities that include Monroe, Mt. Pleasant, Brownstow Kalamazoo, Saginaw, Ann Arbor and Ithaca. “His appointment of an emergency manager in Detroit shows how he continues to gut municipal resources rather than empower communities to thrive,” they said. They continued: “Since Gov. Rick Snyder took power, we have seen Lansing Republicans make more demands of local government while at the same time slashing state funding for vital services like fire, police and libraries. We live in our communities, we walk our streets, and therefore we know best how to meet our constituents’ needs — rather than a bureaucrat sent from Lansing. We oppose the hostile takeover of Michigan’s cities because we believe local governments hold the potential to solve local problems. We believe Gov. Snyder must act as a true partner, not a reckless, heavy-handed bureaucrat. But most of all, we believe in democracy.” Contact Zenobia Jeffries at zjeffries@michigancitizen.com   Tweet Share ‹ Previous Next › About The Author The Michigan Citizen Number of Entries : 3085 Related posts Shut off pause Water: Reprieve, but no resolution Detroit workers, retirees approve EM Orr’s plan of adjustment Detroit water department places 15-day moratorium on shutoffs Logging In...

Jackson/Detroit Free Press More ADVERTISEMENT Gov. Rick Snyder's decision to appoint an emergency financial manager to fix Detroit's escalating fiscal crisis kicks off a chain of events -- a potential challenge from the city's elected leaders, more vocal opposition from infuriated community groups and unavoidable battles ahead over the decisions the new boss will make. But Snyder said Friday after his announcement, broadcast on TV and online, that while he recognized the gravity of Detroit's troubles, quick, early successes in fixing broken streetlights and improving the city's police service will help build confidence among residents that a state takeover will mark a painful but beneficial turning point for the Motor City. "I look at today as a sad day, a day I wish had never happened in the history of Detroit, but also a day of optimism and promise," Snyder told a select audience gathered at a Midtown TV studio. Citing runaway deficits and staggering long-term debts Detroit could never repay on its own, Snyder declared the city to be in a financial emergency, paving the way for the appointment of an emergency manager later this month. State law requires him to give city officials a chance to try to change his mind, however unlikely. • Rochelle Riley: Detroit needs a professional city manager • Related: City Detroit City Council looking at legal options if it can't change governor's mind The decision angered some city leaders. Although Mayor Dave Bing said he disagreed with the governor, he said he would remain focused on restoring "the great Detroit that we all know can be achieved." "We have always said that we need help from Lansing to implement our initiatives such as public safety, transportation, lighting and others," Bing said. "If, in fact, the appointment of an emergency financial manager both stabilizes the city fiscally and supports our restructuring initiatives ... then I think there is a way for us to work together." Looking at partnerships Two areas where the state and city may work together is in public safety and lighting, two issues that many say go hand in hand Snyder said he suspects there will be more partnerships between the Michigan State Police and the Detroit Police Department but did not elaborate. • Elections: City Council, Detroit mayoral elections will go forward • Related: Reactions to emergency financial manager: Change brings out emotions State Treasurer Andy Dillon also mentioned an in-the-works restructuring of the Detroit Police Department likely will mean a slightly smaller department through retirements but with more officers on street patrol. He also gave officers a reason to be hopeful by announcing that the wage cuts they have taken over the years could possibly be restored. Dillon struck a hopeful note for residents who live in the dark -- and fear -- saying that he believes some of Detroit's thousands of nonworking streetlights will be repaired this summer with the state's help. Citing the newly created Detroit Public Lighting Authority, Dillon said, "We can start hanging lights this summer. "The other thing I think is critical: If we don't restore the morale of the Police Department and show the public that the police force is functioning well, I think we'll lose a lot of momentum, so those would be the two biggest items for me." Mounting troubles The troubles Snyder wants fixed have been nipping at Detroit for decades. But they came to a head over the last 18 months as increasingly dour economic reports found a city unable to address fundamental questions of its ability to stay afloat. A state review team concluded last week that Detroit could not do so on its own, facing $14 billion in long-term liabilities and a $327-million accumulated deficit at risk of growing by $100 million by July. That's despite the city being under state oversight since city and state officials signed a consent agreement in April designed to avoid the appointment of an emergency manager. Now, should an emergency financial manager be appointed, that person will be in charge of restructuring Detroit's dire financial mess, likely to include significant cuts and adjustments in public services and a top-down rethinking of the type of government a shrunken city with a dwindling tax base can afford. Bing and the City Council have until March 11 to request a hearing before the governor to appeal his decision, and Snyder said that if that happens, he'll listen to their case and decide it the next day. But Snyder made it clear, if not explicit, that city officials would have to come up with something near-miraculous to sway him. "Things have gone downhill," he said during a meeting with Free Press reporters and editors later Friday. "They continue to spiral down. That can't continue in perpetuity." But the City Council is considering hiring an outside law firm to mount a separate legal challenge to Snyder's appointment. Council members said they were unsure on what basis they would contest the decision. Council President Charles Pugh watched Snyder's address from behind his desk at city hall. Pugh allowed several reporters and TV cameras in his office during the governor's announcement but refused to comment afterward. Several council members said Friday they would fight Snyder's appointment. Some said an emergency financial manager would take away voters' right to choose their leaders. "We have to fight till the end, but we have to fight smart," said Councilwoman Saunteel Jenkins, who before Friday had supported many of Snyder's actions and goals under the consent agreement. Most of Detroit's delegation in Lansing said Snyder's decision was an unacceptable usurpation of the city's voters. "Detroit is clearly not without problems, but these undemocratic actions by the governor will not result in solutions," said state Rep. Bert Johnson, D-Highland Park, whose district includes a portion of Detroit. "They will result in more division between Detroit and the rest of the state." State Sen. Coleman Young Jr., D-Detroit, called the decision "a disaster. It's going to be a fire sale, a scorched-earth policy, and we're not going to have anything left." Other city leaders and at least one Detroit lawmaker were more circumspect, pledging to work alongside Snyder's chosen manager. Snyder would not say who he's considering for the position. He said he has spoken with a top candidate, a person he described only as well-versed in legal and financial issues and skilled in dealing with people from diverse backgrounds. The governor acknowledged the job has been a tough sell, calling it "one of the most challenging positions in the United States. It's a major challenge for anyone, and I didn't try to sugarcoat it" with people he recruited. 'All hands on deck' Snyder reiterated that Detroit, once among the most prosperous cities in the nation, "went from the top to the bottom over the last 50 years," losing more than half its population. "Today is a day to call all hands on deck," Snyder said. "The key answer that all of us want to get to" is a growing, successful city. Snyder also:  Dismissed assertions by Detroit mayoral candidates Lisa Howze, Krystal Crittendon and Benny Napoleon that the report by the review team, lead by Dillon, inflated the city's debts and improperly included liabilities from departments such as water and sewerage that are secured by assets and user payments. "I have confidence in the people who did the financial review team report," Snyder said. "These are really good people who know their stuff."  Said he believed the emergency financial manager can accomplish many of the state's goals within 18 months, after which city officials can vote to remove the manager. Critics, however, point to other, smaller cities that have been under state managers for years, such as Benton Harbor and Ecorse, and doubt a manager can make enough progress that quickly.  Hinted that the state would help pay for some of the needed upgrades in information technology and other areas plaguing Detroit and its ability to accurately assess and collect property and income taxes. But, Snyder said, "I don't want people to get the expectation that there's hundreds of millions of bailout dollars available."  Said he would not suggest to the emergency manager that a new version of the collapsed deal to run Belle Isle as a state park be pursued "unless there's strong support from the city to signal that they want us to do that."

More Details: What's next  The Detroit City Council has until March 11 to respond to Gov. Rick Snyders decision to appoint an emergency financial manager. The council can request a hearing before Snyder to try to change his mind.  After the hearing, Snyder would confirm or revoke his decision.  There is no deadline for Snyder to name an emergency financial manager, but he has been in talks with candidates.  The manager technically would be appointed by the Local Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board. The boards members are all gubernatorial appointees. The board would set the managers salary. Questions+answers: Powers of an emergency financial manager Question: Does an EFM have the authority to change labor contracts without negotiation? Answer: No. EFMs are authorized to renegotiate contracts, but they cant scrap them under Public Act 72. The new emergency manager law, Public Act 436, takes effect March 28. It says an emergency manager may impose new labor terms if negotiations with unions fail and the state approves doing so. Q: Does an EFM have the authority to eliminate a department or transfer functions of one department to another, or eliminate positions? A: Yes. Notwithstanding the provisions of any charter to the contrary, an emergency financial manager may consolidate departments of a unit of local government or transfer functions from one department to another. The manager may appoint, supervise and, at his or her discretion, remove heads of departments other than elected officials, the clerk of the unit of local government, or any ombudsman position. This would also apply under the new emergency manager law. Q: Does an EFM have the authority to sell assets of a unit of local government? A: Yes. An emergency financial manager may, except as restricted by a charter or otherwise, sell or otherwise use the assets of a unit of local government to meet past or current obligations, provided that the use of the assets does not endanger the public health, safety or welfare of residents. Under the new emergency manager law, there are more conditions on such sales, but a manager would have some of that same authority. Q: Does an EFM have the authority to institute bankruptcy proceedings for a unit of local government? A: Yes. An EFM may institute proceedings only under Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. Before instituting bankruptcy proceedings, an emergency financial manager first must notify in writing the Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board. The board then has 60 days during which it can disapprove of bankruptcy. Under the new emergency manager law, an emergency manager may also institute such proceedings. Q: Does an EFM have the authority to supervise existing staff? A: Yes. The EFM may issue to city officials or employees any orders that the EFM considers necessary to accomplish the purposes of the manager law, including, but not limited to, orders for the implementation of a financial plan. That also would be true under Public Act 436.

Rick Snyder of Michigan announced on Friday that the city of Detroit is so snarled in financial woes that the state must appoint an emergency manager to lead it out of disaster. “There is probably no city that is more financially challenged in the entire United States. If you look at the quality of services for citizens it’s ranked among the worst. So we went from the top to the bottom over the last 50 or 60 years,” Mr. Snyder told Detroiters in a town-hall-style meeting that was broadcast live on local television stations across the city. “It’s time to say we should stop going downhill,” he said. “There have been many good people that have had many plans, many attempts to turn this around, they haven’t worked. The way I view it, today is a day to call all hands on deck.” The state-appointed manager, who could be selected later this month, would ultimately wield powers aimed at swiftly turning around the municipal government’s dire circumstances — powers to cut city spending, change contracts with labor unions, merge or eliminate city departments, urge the sale of city assets and even, if all else failed, to recommend bankruptcy proceedings. After a state report that Detroit is carrying more than $14 billion in long-term liabilities and experiencing nearly annual projections of cash shortfalls, the decision was years — perhaps decades — in the making. Still, it set off a range of pointed, emotional reactions here about whether this was the first step toward true repair in a city that was once the nation’s fourth largest or one last very public sign of a city crumbling. Some elected city leaders have widely criticized the notion of an outside manager as a takeover of their city and an affront to democratic principles, and they were expected to protest the governor’s decision. Under Michigan law, city officials have 10 days in which to seek reconsideration by the governor, as well as the possibility for a legal appeal in the courts after that. The decision comes during an election year for the mayor and City Council here, and even before Mr. Snyder’s formal announcement on Friday, members of the City Council had been mulling legal options, including the possibility of hiring outside lawyers to block the move While the State of Michigan has sent in managers to solve crises in other smaller cities over many years, the move is politically fraught in Detroit, the state’s largest city and a mostly black city dominated by Democrats in a mostly white state where the capital is now controlled by Republicans, including Mr. Snyder. Some political experts in Michigan have speculated that Mr. Snyder will choose a financial expert who is African-American in an effort to calm racial dimensions of the move in a city that is 83 percent black. Mr. Snyder said he has a top candidate for the job — someone he declined to name on Friday — to recommend to a three-person state panel that will make the appointment. Leaders of the local N.A.A.C.P. in Detroit vehemently denounced the notion. “This is anti-democratic, not needed, and it’s against everything that this nation was founded upon,” the Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the local chapter, said in an interview. “For one individual to be able to wipe out the duties of our duly-elected officials, that’s more or less a dictatorship and it’s against everything that America is supposed to be about.” Mr. Anthony added that the State of Michigan might want to consider whether it really wants to take on the difficult troubles of a city where residents have complained bitterly about darkened streetlights, slow response times by police officers and delayed buses even as city coffers are drained. “If you come into Detroit,” Mr. Anthony said, “you own Detroit. You own education. You own police and fire. You own public lighting.” Some business leaders, however, said they welcomed the prospect of a state-appointed manager. Even as the city has wrestled with a shrinking population and tax base and shortfalls in the budget to pay for public services, there are signs of growth in the private sector, and some business leaders say the city’s financial tangle has become the one remaining factor still holding back Detroit. “Our motto has been, ‘bring it on,’” Sandy K. Baruah, chairman of the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce, said of an outside manager. “This sends a positive message to business that Detroit is fixing its problems.” Snyder has been criticized in the past for using this particular power granted him under state law to essentially step in and sweep the elected leaders of a locality aside, and I’m sure that we’ll hear some of the same kind of criticism now. At the same time, though Detroit’s fiscal and economic problems are the stuff of legend at this point and, politically, the city has been a mess for decades. Indeed, the city’s last Mayor is currently serving prison term after being convicted of multiple counts of corruption. In the end, cities and municipalities are subordinate to the state and, in Michigan’s case, it would simply be insane for the state to sit back and do nothing while the state’s largest city sinks further into the sewer. Before this announcement, it was being reported that city officials were contemplating putting Detroit through Chapter 9 Bankruptcy. If that’s not an indictment of their own competence, I don’t know what is. Perhaps it’s time for someone who knows what they’re doing to take charge.

It’s undemocratic not only because the city leaders are elected, but because Michigan voters struck down one version of the emergency manager law just this November.

Paul Weyrich has said publicly that conservatives do not want people to vote. That was several years ago. Certainly, only a fool couldn’t see that the conservative movement and the GOP have done everything they can to damage government institutions, in office or out for decades now. I think Robert S Kaplan in The Coming Anarchy (1994) got the future right, but totally neo- liberalled out on the cause. But nations are crumbling and borders are blurring all over the world and Detroit is a victim, too, of the disastrously implemented Neoliberal agenda.

Newark, Camden, Jersey City and Patterson. Baltimore. New Orleans.

Because in saying that, he proves he’s completely different from any other dictator who has seized power from a democratically elected government. Those guys always say “I’m doing this so I can have lots and lots of power!!!” That’s how we can tell a dictator apart from a noble, freedom lover like Snyder.

The people of the state put that law on the ballot and voted it down in a referendum. So the Republicans (led by Snyder) passed a new version that was explicitly immune from public referendum. So this was done in direct contravention of the will of the majority of voters of the state. http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/12/replacement_emergency_manager.html So nice snark in favor of this dictatorial power grab… but you are completely wrong.

Rick Snyder and his cronies don’t live there – like all feudal lords, their castles lie many leagues away, and their personal life will be blissfully unaffected by the “tough love” inflicted by their appointed Sheriff of Nottingham.

And yet the same people who loudly protest how they need their guns to protect against tyranny will all be loudly applauding this move.

I find it odd all of the progressives who have zero problem with nationalized health care, nationalizing educational standards, and who love Robin Hood Laws, now are great supporters of local political control.

It is simple and lazy to argue that the catastrophy that was 60 years in the making is mainly the fault of Detroit’s political leaders. With just a little research, you’d fine that what is happening in Detroit is the culmination of the perfect storm involving greed, power trips, loss of resources, racial and social tension, intentional sabatoge (external and from within), and the lack of cooperation between the state and local government on a scale that is likely unmatched in any other major city. Sounds a lot like what is going on in Washington doesn’t it? In essence, Detroit is no different than what is going on at the federal level. Detroit did not magically fall into financial abyss by over-extending itself! Detroit arrived at that state by measures, taken well before city counsel were thought to be “incompetent”, that undermined Detroit’s continued potential for success. And no, a financial manager is not the solution. If Obama had the unmitigated power to appoint a financial czar to address the $16 trillion dollar national debt many of you would go nuts as there would be no checks and balances and congress would be rendered useless. Furthermore, it is usually not in the job description of the financial manager to find ways to increase revenue (which involves investments – yes, spending), a very important factor in any city’s ability to attract revenue through economic activity.

When it is all running smoothly there is little concern over the underlying mechanics but when repairs are needed, suddenly a grasp of reality is needed. While the particulars depend on the Michigan constitution, cities are chartered or incorporated and do not have sovereignty independent of the state that grants their charter. Their police powers are delegations from the State. As is their ability to issue debt and levy taxes. In short, a city is far more like the much hated corporation than a sovereign entity such as the State. As the State granted the charter for the city to form, so can it revoke that charter when the city cannot maintain itself as an ongoing enterprise, or as in this case, appoint an emergency manager to either correct the problems or take the city into bankruptcy.
