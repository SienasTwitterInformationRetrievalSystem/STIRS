Posted by TampaBayDowns Fan · 485 days ago Show All 20 Comments cocoa2 · IMLD will be hard pressed to find a kick leaving Gulfstream. I think Shanghai Bobby is going to slow that pace so that I could out run him and then kick out, open up 2 at the head of the turn and come home beating a drifting Orb and fast closing Its myluckyday · 484 days ago travel_vic · Speedballs don't often win it (recall that one shipper from California, Snow Chief who later passed the Derby), but they hamg around a lot on the board giving the idea that they could at longer distances. · 484 days ago 2013 Florida Derby (G1) Gonna go with Orb to win, with IMLD and Frac Daddy hitting the board. I like Clearly Now as a possible upsetter as well. Posted by Southern.Humor · 486 days ago Show All 31 Comments Southern.Humor · Frac Daddy is a horse I think has a lot of potential and is improving which is why he was my third pick. · 485 days ago icyhotboo · If MM and SB hook up in a speed duel then IMLD and Orb should easily hit. I guess that's what makes it exciting, the improbable happens twice as much as the probable. · 485 days ago 2013 Florida Derby (G1) Would not be suprised if IMLD or SB are on the outside looking in on Derby Day after not acquiring enough points in the Florida Derby. Personally, I hope they both make it in, as they'll take a lot of $ and will not be too fond of that 10th furlong.

Because Shug is an old time trainer who raced his horses and had less works. His philosophy is the same as Johnny Nerud, Allen Jerkens, Ben and Jimmy Jones, Sunny Jim Etc. Etc. they raced often and between stakes races they found allowance races to sharpen up their horses. Their horses were sounder and raced longer. The run once a month crowd with lots of works seem to have a lot of injured and quickly retired horses. · 486 days ago On The Gallop's · URR- Awesome Comment...lol.

He is a very competitive horse, who I believe could shape up to be quite good. I wouldn't say the FL Derby is historical for speed horses to win. Did you see the 2011 and 2010 races? Both were come from behind horses. Speed doesn't always win. · 486 days ago 2013 Florida Derby (G1) I'll go with Orb because this is going to be a hot pace which sets him up for the win.

Several top quality horses going head-to-head. We may look back at this race as a key race producing the 3 y.o. champ or the top future campaigners/stallions. Interesting to see who emerges.

EDITIONS: USA ESPAÑOL More Australia Brazil United Kingdom CITIES: BOSTON CHICAGO DALLAS LOS ANGELES NEW YORK ESPN Road to the Triple Crown Shop Orb shines in Florida Derby Updated: March 30, 2013, 9:23 PM ET By Jack Shinar | Bloodhorse Recommend Tweet Comments Email Print Recommend Tweet Comments Email Print Subscribe FLORIDA DERBY | PURSE: $1 MILLION | 3-YEAR-OLDS | GRADE 1 | 1 1/8 MILE Post Horse Win Place Show 6 Orb $7.80 $3.80 $3.40 3 Itsmyluckyday   $3.00 $2.60 8 Merit Man     $8.60 Trainer Shug McGaughey said he was waiting for Orb to take him to Louisville. The Hall of Fame conditioner should be on his way after the colt's impressive win in the $1 million Besilu Stables Florida Derby March 30. Under a patient ride from John Velazquez, 5-2 shot Orb headed favored Itsmyluckyday approaching the sixteenth pole and coasted home in front to secure a berth in the Kentucky Derby May 4. Orb won by 2 3/4 lengths while completing the 1 1/8-mile distance in 1:50.87. Combined with his win in the Besilu Stables Fountain of Youth Feb. 23, Orb has 150 points and rockets to the lead in the standings for a berth in the Derby. The Florida Derby was worth 100 points, with 40 points to the runner-up, 20 to third, and 10 to fourth. Juvenile champion Shanghai Bobby was a no-show in the Florida Derby, finishing off the board, and appears to be on the outside looking in at the Derby. Itsmyluckyday, the 8-5 pick in the field of 10 3-year-olds, held second and looks solid for a slot in the Derby starting gate with 50 points. Outsider Merit Man, who set a tepid pace, was third, with 99-1 shot Narvaez fourth. Orb, a Kentucky-bred son of Malibu Moon out of the winning Unbridled mare Lady Liberty, races for his breeders, Stuart Janney III and Ogden Mills "Dinny" Phipps. Orb raced mid-pack for Velazquez as Merit Man showed the way over Narvaez, Itsmyluckyday, and Shanghai Bobby at the rail. Fractions for the first six furlongs were comfortable at :24.74, :48.57, and 1:12.89. Itsmyluckyday, ridden by Elvis Trujillo, stalked the pace three wide before taking over at the quarter pole. The Holy Bull winner led by one length in the stretch as Orb advanced to collar Merit Man. Itsmyluckyday continued to lead past the eighth pole when challenged by Orb, and could not keep pace as Orb drew off impressively. Itsmyluckyday was 2 1/4 lengths clear of third-place Merit Man, with Narvaez five lengths farther back in fourth. Shanghai Bobby, contending with the rail post, stalked the pace at the inside for Rosie Napravnik into the far turn but weakened in the stretch to be fifth. He was followed by Pick of the Litter, Frac Daddy, Are You Kidding Me, Indy's Illusion, and Pontiff. Orb, who started the year with an allowance/optional claiming win at Gulfstream Jan. 26, is 3-for-3 over the track this meet. He won the Fountain of Youth by half a length over Violence Feb. 23, coming from off the pace. The bay colt is on a four-race winning streak since breaking his maiden in his fourth start last November at Aqueduct Racetrack. The $600,000 winner's share of the Florida Derby extended Orb's career earnings to $921,050. Under equal weights of 122 pounds, third choice Orb paid $7.80, $3.80, $3.40. Itsmyluckyday returned $3 and $2.60. The exacta was worth $23.40. Merit Man paid $8.60 to show.

Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Shangahi Bobby fades late and will likely not qualify.  Tweet Share on Twitter Share Share on Facebook  Share Share on Google Plus + Comments Orb made a strong move towards the lead pack entering the far turn and then ran down the 8/5 favorite, Itsmyluckyday, in deep stretch to win the Florida Derby and secure a spot in the 2013 Kentucky Derby. Second favorite Shanghai Bobby ran up with the leader for the first six furlongs and then faded badly to finish well back of the top two. Longshots Merit Man and Narvaez rounded out the top four finishers. The 2013 Florida Derby was billed as a clash between Itsmyluckyday, Shanghai Bobby and Orb, the dominant three-year-old colts at Gulfstream Park this spring. And leading up to the $1 million race and key prep on the road to the Kentucky Derby, the betting public reinforced that notion by making those colts the three favorites at odds ranging from 8/5 to 5/2. The 2013 Florida Derby is part of the official Road to the Kentucky Derby series sponsored by Churchill Downs, with the top four finishers in the race all receiving points towards a spot in the starting gate in Louisville on the first Saturday in May. With the victory, Orb and Itsmyluckyday have secured enough points to guarantee a spot in the Derby. However, juvenile champion Shanghai Bobby is now on the outside looking in. Orb is a three-year-old colt by Malibu Moon, trained by Shug McGaughey and ridden by jockey John Velazquez. If everything goes to plan over the next five weeks, he'll make his next start in this year's Kentucky Derby.

Riding Orb, the Hall of Fame jockey completed a 5-of-5 sweep of his races at the park on the afternoon, riding the aforementioned Orb to a come-from-behind victory after an inspired run down the final furlong. With the win, expect to see Orb in the starting gate on May 4, as the Florida Derby helped position another horse into the Kentucky Derby field. Merit Man jumped out to an early lead out of the gate from the No. 8 post, holding a lead over Narvaez and Itsmyluckyday until the field rounded the final furlong. Velazquez and Orb then made their collective move. Riding neck and neck with Itsmyluckyday down the stretch, Orb took the outside move and chased down the top-two leaders, pulling away in the last few strides to give trainer Shug McGaughey a spot in the Run for the Roses and Velasquez his fifth win of the day. Shanghai Bobby, which started in the furthest-inside post, faltered out of the gate and finished well back of the top-four finishers in fifth—a disappointing run for a horse that won all five of its starts as a two-year-old. Take a look at the results, payouts and analysis from this prequel race to the 2013 Kentucky Derby.   Florida Derby 2013 Results Place Horse Payout (Win, Place, Show) Post 1 Orb $7.80, $3.80, #3.40 6 2 Itsmyluckyday $3.00, $2.60 3 3 Merit Man $8.60 8 4 Narvaez   10 5 Shanghai Bobby   1 6 Pick of the Litter   2 7 Frac Daddy   5 8 Are You Kidding Me   9 9 Indy's Illusion   7 10 Pontiff   4   Payouts (based on $1.00 bets) Bet Combo Payout Exacta 6/3 $11.70 Double 3/6 $13.60 Trifecta 6/3/8 $154.70 Superfecta 6/3/8/10 $2.430.50   Analysis Harry How/Getty Images In case you missed it, here's a look at some of the stats from the race, courtesy of Churchill Downs' PR account on Twitter: Florida Derby Order of Finish. 6-3-8-10-1-2-5-9-7-4. Margins: 2 3/4, 2 1/4, 5, 3/4, 2 3/4, 4 1/2, 3 1/4, 5 1/4, head. Time: 1:50.87— Churchill Downs PR (@DerbyMedia) March 30, 2013 While it isn't any surprise to some after 3/1 odds, Orb took care of business in a big way on Saturday. The young horse wasn't as highly-favored as fellow participants Itsmyluckyday or Shanghai Bobby, but he was clearly the most explosive horse on the outside of the starting gate and made up for his slow start with a furious pace down the final few furlongs of the race. As noted by Ray Paulick on Twitter, Orb is a dangerous horse when thinking about the big race in May: In my opinion, Orb won Florida Derby without really being trained that hard by Shug McGaughey: a few half-mile breezes. Big step forward.— Ray Paulick (@raypaulick) March 30, 2013 Orb won its last race (at Gulfstream Park, no less) in late February, cruising to a victory at the 2013 Fountain of Youth Stakes. Velasquez and the young colt built on that momentum with another win at Gulfstream on Saturday, one that raises the stakes with the Triple Crown now in its blinders. The rest of the field has work to do. The top-four finishers all gain points toward earning a spot in the 20-horse Kentucky Derby field, but Orb and Velasquez come away from this race with the biggest selling points toward why you should pick Orb when it comes to your Kentucky Derby selections.

Second favorite Shanghai Bobby ran up with the leader for the first six furlongs and then faded badly to finish well back of the top two. Longshots Merit Man and Narvaez rounded out the top four finishers. The 2013 Florida Derby was billed as a clash between Itsmyluckyday, Shanghai Bobby and Orb, the dominant three-year-old colts at Gulfstream Park this spring. And leading up to the $1 million race and key prep on the road to the Kentucky Derby, the betting public reinforced that notion by making those three colts the three favorites at odds ranging from 8/5 to 5/2. The 2013 Florida Derby part of the official Road to the Kentucky Derby series sponsored by Churchill Downs, with the top four finishers in the race all receiving points towards a spot in the starting gate in Louisville on the first Saturday in May. Orb is a three-year-old colt by Malibu Moon, trained by Shug McGaughey and ridden by jockey John Velazquez. If everything goes to plan over the next five weeks, he'll make his next start in this year's Kentucky Derby.

(Post Time: 6:19 pm Eastern; TV: NBCSN) Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Shanghai Bobby will be making just his second start since November, while morning line favorite Itsmyluckyday is running in his third race of the season. Currently, neither Itsmyluckyday or Shanghai Bobby have enough points to feel completely secure in qualifying for a spot in the Kentucky Derby. A top two finish in Saturday's race will likely get both colts into the Derby; a third place finish will put either one on the edge of qualifying, and any finish outside the top 3 would severely compromise the chances of each colt. Joining the top two in the race is Orb, the impressive winner of the Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream in late February. Additionally, Merit Man, second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Sprint last fall, will stretch out to two turns for the first time in his career.
