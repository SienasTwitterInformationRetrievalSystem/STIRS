(Photo by AP) Print Mike Scott, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Mike Scott, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on February 25, 2013 at 3:28 PM, updated February 25, 2013 at 3:29 PM View/Post Comments LOS ANGELES -- It was the elephant in the room during Sunday's 85th annual Academy Awards, and Oscar host Seth MacFarlane wasted no time referencing it: "Argo" director Ben Affleck's glaring absence among the nominees for best director -- despite winning at most major pre-Oscar award shows and seeing "Argo" emerge as the prohibitive best-picture favorite. Referring in his opening monologue to Affleck's film -- about a real-life, covert CIA mission to smuggle six Americans out of Iran during the 1979-'80 hostage crisis -- MacFarlane made it clear that he, for one, thought Affleck definitely should have been nominated. "The story is so secret that the film's director is unknown to the Academy," MacFarlane said, generating one of the evening's first rounds of rousing applause. He then added, almost as an aside: "They know they screwed up -- Ben, it's not your fault." So when "Argo" was named best picture on Sunday - earning an Oscar statuette each for Affleck, Grant Heslov and George Clooney, who all worked as producers on the film -- it represented a moment of vindication for Affleck. Heslov, for one, made sure it didn't go unnoticed. "On behalf of George and myself, I want to thank you, Ben," Heslov said on-stage before turning the mic over to Affleck. "You directed a hell of a film. Couldn't be more proud of the film. Couldn't be more proud of Ben. So ladies and gentlemen, our co-producer and the director of 'Argo': Ben Affleck." Backstage in the Oscar interview room, Affleck addressed his snubbing - which was arguably the single biggest story of this Oscar season -- but it apparently wasn't one he wanted to dwell on. "Honestly, you know how I feel about (not being nominated)?" Affleck said. "Naturally, I was disappointed. ... But when I look at the directors who were people who weren't nominated as well -- Paul Thomas Anderson and Kathryn Bigelow, just amazing, Tom Hooper and Quentin Tarantino -- these are all directors who I admire enormously.  So, it was a very tough year." Added Clooney: "You were in good company not to be nominated." "Exactly," Affleck continued. "You know what? You're not entitled to anything. I'm honored to be here. I'm honored to be among these extraordinary movies -- and I'm really, really honored to win an Academy Award." When the trio was asked when they realized that a best picture win could be a real possibility, they slipped into an impromptu comedy team, releasing their tension with a little rapid-fire riffing. "Michelle Obama," Clooney responded without skipping a beat, referencing the first lady's presenting of the nominees minutes before the winner was announced. Heslov: "Tonight." Affleck: "When they gave us the trophies I was confident that we would win."  Clooney: "I'm completely confident." Affleck: "I did a second guess: 'Is this a prank?'" Clooney: "He did look at the envelope." Heslov: "Even as I was giving the speech, I didn't think we could win."

But, while fashion faux pas and speech gaffes are to be expected, every year the short-list of nominees demonstrates the glaring inconsistencies within the Academy voting system. The list of Best Film snubs is endless, quite simply because there is only one award, meaning common sense dictates that for every The Godfather there will invariably be a Driving Miss Daisy. However, the real injustices are revealed when the nominees are first announced. For instance, how can a director, who has a film nominated for Best Picture, not be short-listed for Best Director? I don't actually believe Argo is the best film nominated this year- Zero Dark Thirty and Amour are both far more complex- however, Ben Affleck's individual snub from the directors' category again begs the same question. This conundrum is nothing new. Indeed, the 1970s was the high-water mark for American cinema, however, it still contains a list of injustices, the pain of which are still felt today. Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) was ground breaking, becoming the first ever summer blockbuster after grossing an incredible $260-million at the box-office. The film was quite rightly nominated for Best Picture, however, the courageous young film maker who directed it was not nominated. This kind of high handed behaviour has continually made the Academy look foolish. Some of the most famous snubs actually involve Martin Scorsese, who despite being one of the finest American filmmakers ever, was consistently ignored by the Academy. Ironically, after more than three decades of embarrassment, Scorsese received an Oscar in 2007 for The Departed, a film that was totally derivative of his earlier work. In more recent times, there is an obvious explanation for Oscar snubs; aggressive marketing and laziness on the part of voters. This is no more evident than in 2012, which was an unusually good year for arthouse pictures. In fact, this was borne out with the eventual winner, The Artist, which only succeeded because producing maestro and awards alchemist Harvey Weinstein fortuitously bought it at Cannes, and then proceeded to promote the hell out of it. Others were not so lucky. From a UK perspective, Steve McQueen's excellent drama Shame was only nominated in one category, with Michael Fassbender missing out as one of the year's best leading actors. Also, Lynne Ramsey's harrowing We Need To Talk About Kevin, which featured a superb performance by Tilda Swinton, was completely ignored. What both these films have in common, aside from being totally uncompromising, is that they do not fit the perceived Academy blue-print. If this is the case, studios generally do not get behind them, rendering them invisible to lazy Academy members. In an ideal world Oscar voters should take in an interest in cinema as a whole, and not leave themselves vulnerable to the marketing juggernaut that hurtles through Hollywood every year. The 85th Academy Awards take place on 24 February 2013.

Illustration by: R. Kikuo Johnson This story first appeared in the Feb. 22 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. Recommended Box Office Milestone: Ben Affleck's 'Argo' Hitting $200 Million Worldwide BAFTAs 2013: 'Les Misérables' and 'Argo' Take This Year's Big Awards The Painstaking Work of Making 'Argo' Authentic Why Ben Affleck's DGA Win Matters Even Though He's Not Oscar-Nominated (Analysis) How to Fix Oscar's Baffling Snub of Ben Affleck (Analysis) "I don't worry too much about who got what," Ben Affleck insisted at the Academy's Nominees Luncheon on Feb. 4. As a producer of front-runner Argo, the filmmaker can afford to be charitable when it comes to his conspicuous omission from the list of directing nominees at the 85th Academy Awards. Veterans including Steven Spielberg and Ang Lee have almost become background extras as Affleck has gone about collecting directing honors at the Golden Globes, the DGA Awards and, most recently, the BAFTAs. But the spotlight will shift back to them at the Feb. 24 Oscars when they are two of five nominees in a race that is baffling even the most hardened pundits. PHOTOS: Ben Affleck at 40: Portraits of 'Argo's' Leading Man, Director and Oscar-Baiting Auteur One clue to the eventual winner came at the DGAs -- not when the prize went to Affleck, but earlier in the evening. During the Feb. 2 ceremony, each nominee was called onstage to accept a medallion for himself and his crew. Among the nominees (Affleck, Lee for Life of Pi, Spielberg for Lincoln, Kathryn Bigelow for Zero Dark Thirty and Tom Hooper for Les Miserables), it was Spielberg who received the one standing ovation -- by far the most heartfelt response of the evening. That could mean Spielberg is the front-runner in the Oscar competition, especially given that the DGA always has been the best predictor of Oscar success. But it might simply be a sign of affection and respect for the most successful filmmaker in history. If not Spielberg, then whom? Three of the Oscar-nominated directors -- David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook), Benh Zeitlin (Beasts of the Southern Wild) and Michael Haneke (Amour) -- have a major strike against them: Each also is nominated for script, Haneke for best original screenplay and the others in the adapted category. That gives the Academy (whose entire membership will vote for the winners now that each branch has selected its nominees) the option of rewarding them with writing awards instead of directing honors. STORY: The Painstaking Work of Making 'Argo' Authentic Russell's BAFTA for his Silver screenplay, which he received Feb. 10, might hurt him as director, prompting the Academy to vote for the writer-director's script rather than his helming. Haneke could be damaged even more than Russell because he is the favorite in the best foreign-language picture category for Amour. (Technically, the foreign-language Oscar goes to the country that has submitted the movie, but the helmer keeps the trophy.) And even if Amour doesn't win for foreign-language film, Haneke still would be a long shot because no film nominated as best foreign-language picture has ever won the director Oscar. In the past decade, there have been some notable foreign-language films whose directors have earned nominations -- including Julian Schnabel's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Babel and Fernando Meirelles' City of God -- but none has won for director. (The Artist, of course, was a silent film, and The Weinstein Co. went to lengths to establish its Hollywood credentials.) If Haneke's chances seem slim, Zeitlin's are even slimmer. The 30-year-old, first-time feature filmmaker and wunderkind failed to be nominated by other major awards groups such as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and the DGA, and while the Academy has veered toward "specialty" films in recent years (though not this time), it never has awarded the Oscar to the maker of a shoestring-budget movie like the $1.8 million Beasts. STORY: Ben Affleck Reflects on 'Once in a Lifetime' Awards Season in THR Exit Interview (Video) This leaves Lee, who was relatively absent from the awards circuit until the past couple of weeks, leading many insiders to suspect he was out of the game. In fact, his absence might have helped, making his re-emergence a refreshing change in the media-saturated awards race. Recently, he has been everywhere from the Visual Effects Society Awards (where he was presented the Visionary Award on Feb. 5) to interviews with KPCC's Larry Mantle. His surge in visibility adds to Pi's heft, with its 11 nominations and $564 million global box office. But Lee has the disadvantage of having directed a film with no acting nominations, meaning the Academy's 1,178 active actor members could lean against him. If Spielberg or Lee wins for best director but sees his film lose in the best picture race, it will be deja vu all over again. Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005) were the favorites for best picture -- then lost to Shakespeare in Love and Crash, respectively. Back then, the duo's directing Oscars seemed like something of a consolation prize. This year, with Argo eyeing the big bauble, a directing Oscar will be a major victory in itself.

By Joey Magidson Film Contributor *** Ladies and gentlemen, the Best Picture race is just about a done deal. It looks almost certain that Argo is going to win the biggest Oscar of them all. For a season that had the award leaning in the direction of Les Miserables, Life of Pi, Lincoln and Zero Dark Thirty at different points (not to mention way back when The Great Gatsby was supposedly a safe bet), seeing the race end up between Argo and Silver Linings Playbook (with the former out in front of the latter by a solid margin) rubs some the wrong way. There are two schools of thought surrounding how Argo got where it is today. Both have some validity to them, but both have holes. They both also have to do with a certain category snub for the film and its filmmaker. As is the case every year with figuring out how Academy voters came to the decision they did (though I concede that they still haven’t officially made up their minds and have until Tuesday to turn in their ballots), the truth probably lies somewhere in between the two theories. But that one snub is where it all begins. One thought process is based almost solely on Ben Affleck getting snubbed for Best Director and a whole heap of goodwill (or perhaps pity) being hoisted upon the flick as a result. The theory posits that Argo was dead and buried until Affleck was left out of the Directing category. That shock, in turn, sounded a rallying cry that not just revived the film, but pushed it forward to frontrunner status as well, almost as a protest on behalf of Affleck. The other school of thought suggests that Argo is the only real consensus film of 2012 and that it was always going to emerge as the winner through process of elimination and the preferential balloting system. Those who think this way look at the other eight Best Picture contenders and see fatal flaws that prevent enough people from voting the others to victory. As I mentioned above, there’s logic in both trains of thought, but it all comes down to how much Affleck’s snub matters in the grand scheme of things. Was his omission the turning point, or was the film always in a strong position? Did the snub just throw us off the scent? Those who believe Affleck’s snub was the best thing to ever happen to Argo point to how most people pegged the flick as left for dead on nomination morning. I happen to have been in that category at that point, though it pained me to say it. That morning, it appeared like Life of Pi was the only one with a shot at winning Best Picture besides Lincoln, which appeared the odds-on favorite. That didn’t remain the case for long, though, as the precursors then began and shook things up. One by one, every major precursor went to Affleck and/or Argo. The Directors Guild, the Producers Guild, the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild are make-or-break awards (to differing degrees, though), and each chose to honor Argo/Affleck. The same goes for the British voting block, which cited the same combination at the BAFTA awards. Almost without exception, this sort of winning streak results in a slam-dunk Best Picture win at the Oscars. If you subscribe to Affleck’s snub fueling all of this, then you look at his Director miss and credit it with making all of these awards happen. The folks who feel that Argo was always the once and future king don’t deny that the snub turned some extra attention on the movie, but they feel that it was going to happen either way. With strong detractors going after films like Les Miserables and Zero Dark Thirty, as well as a general lack of top-level enthusiasm for Lincoln, Argo was in a spot where it had the most positive vibes and the least negative ones. Also fueling this sort of thinking is the precursor sweep I spoke of above. Could Argo have won all of that if it didn’t already have a strong army of supporters before the Affleck snub? If you’re someone who believes in this school of thought, then you say no. Personally, I’m caught somewhere in the middle, though I lean more toward the latter theory than the former. It certainly doesn’t hurt that Argo was my #1 film of 2012, but objectively speaking, it always had the fewest obstacles in its path. Affleck being snubbed did galvanize some, but it mostly just served to make this run seem more unlikely than it should have been. If you’re looking for an answer as to why Argo is where it is, I’d say that you need to see the whole picture and take Affleck’s snub with a grain of salt, understanding how fickle the race was this time around. There just never was a strong frontrunner, so when Affleck was omitted from Best Director, it sent us into an unnecessary panic. The precursors were probably headed in Argo’s direction regardless. By this time next week, Argo should have the Best Picture prize on its mantle. To some degree, Affleck’s snub rallied supporters, but more than likely most of them were already there. Argo had a silent majority behind it, and it was the film that they wanted to win all along.

REVIEWS TOP STORIES BOLLYWOOD HOLLYWOOD REGIONAL TV MUSIC PHOTOS VIDEOS Quentin Tarantino thinks Ben Affleck's Oscar snub was worse than his BANG Showbiz | February 18, 2013 18:07 IST (New Delhi ) Tweet Print  Quentin Tarantino feels sorry for Ben Affleck. Both directors missed out on Best Director Oscar nominations on Thursday even though their movies Django Unchained and Argo picked up nods in other categories but Quentin thinks Ben's snub was worse than his. Speaking at the Django Unchained premiere at London's Empire, Leicester Square, he told BANG Showbiz: "It would have been nice and everything but at the end of the day, I actually feel more sorry for Ben Affleck. He really deserved it and I think we all thought he was going to get it, so I feel really sorry for him." While, Quentin is excited that his own movie received five Academy Award nominations, he doesn't believe it will win the night's biggest award, Best Picture. He said: "It feels very lovely, it's nice to be invited to the party. It's been a good week. Five Oscar nominations today, five BAFTA nominations yesterday. I don't think it will win Best Picture. But if it did, I will take it for sure." While Christoph Waltz was unexcited about his own nomination for Best Supporting Actor, saying: "I have no idea if I will win. I'm not a bookmaker," the movie's female star Kerry Washington was more enthusiastic. She said: "It's quite a ride, it's very exciting." The premiere was also attended by the film's stars Jamie Foxx and Samuel L. Jackson while celebrities including Ashley Roberts, Hugo Taylor, James Arthur and Tyler James also walked the white carpet.
