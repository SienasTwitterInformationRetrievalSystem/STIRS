Professional courtesy. " "Why did God make snakes just before lawyers? To practice." "A lawyer trying to get tickets to a Broadway show, finally settled for a couple of seats a year in advance. When the exciting night arrived and he sat down in his seat, a woman in front of the lawyer noticed the empty seat next to him and asked why such a valuable commodity was unused. The lawyer replied that his wife couldn't make it. The woman asked him if he didn't have relatives or friends who could have used the seat. He replied, "Oh, they're all at the funeral."" "A man died and was taken to his place of eternal torment by the devil. As he passed raging fire pits and shrieking sinners, he saw a man he recognized as a lawyer snuggling up to a beautiful woman. 'That's unfair!' he cried. 'I have to roast for all eternity, and that lawyer gets to spend it with a beautiful woman.' 'Shut up,' barked the devil, jabbing the man with his pitchfork. 'Who are you to question that woman's punishment?\'" "What's the difference between a lawyer and a trampoline? You take off your shoes before you jump on a trampoline." N.B.

Posted: 02/21/2013 3:35 pm Read more Lawyer Jokes , Science Of Humour , Science Of Laughter , Comedy , Court , Laughologist , Legal System , Canada News share this story Submit this story digg reddit stumble Q: Why won't sharks attack lawyers? A: Professional courtesy. "Lawyer." These days just the word conjures up jokes. Type "Lawyer Jokes" into Google and you get "About 2,760,000 results. "Suddenly you'll see pages and pages of sites dedicated to them. Most of the lawyer jokes portray lawyers as greedy, parasitical and soulless. And of course those are the nicer ones. Q: What's the difference between a jellyfish and a lawyer? A: One's a spineless, poisonous blob. The other is a form of sea life. In the Lawyer Jokes, lawyers are often compared unfavourably to various predators or insects. The lawyers then swiftly rob a blind elderly woman, or hurtle off a cliff en masse, or get buried entirely in cement. Yes, those are the gentler ones. There are even jokes about lawyer jokes. Q: How many lawyer jokes are there? A: Only three. The rest are true stories. Lawyer jokes have been around for centuries, yes there's even sites dedicated to ancient and medieval lawyer jokery. But in modern times, it seems, the intensity and popularity of lawyer joking has gotten to the point where something had to be done. The Ontario Bar Association has just launched a multi-pronged ad campaign to rescue the image of lawyers. But like a surprise punch line that campaign itself could be on its way to becoming more comedy. Predictably some of its harshest critics are lawyers themselves. Mitch Kowalski, lawyer and author of Avoiding Extinction, Re-imagining Legal Services for the 21st Century, sums up the campaign in a word: Arrogant. "Obviously," he said. "The OBA has too much money and doesn't know what to do with it." His beef: While ostensibly attempting to "humanize" lawyers, the campaign does the opposite. First it asks a lot of its intended target -- the public. The print ad is basically a massive letter "I" filled with paragraphs of text, explaining why a particular Ontario Lawyer went to law school. By any marketing standards, the quantity of text is daunting and it seems to work from the assumption the public has a burning desire to know why lawyers became lawyers. Q: What's the difference between a lawyer and God? A: God doesn't think he's a lawyer. A typical ad has one lawyer saying as a youth "had many dreams" that someday he "would make a difference in people's lives." The goal is to show that many lawyers have diverse and admirable reasons for becoming lawyers, surely true. But he implementation moves swiftly into classic lawyer joke stereotype: That lawyers will inevitably assault you with an opaque wall of words. The ads are visually reminiscent of the endless legal disclaimers that precede new software that people habitually ignore. Says Kowalski: "The ad campaign reminds me of the old joke that lawyers get paid by the word." Q: What's the difference between a lawyer and a herd of buffalo? A: The lawyer charges more. It's perhaps the comments made by people in the campaign itself that are most counter-productive. Here's how Brian Howlett, head creative for Agency59, the company behind the campaign, explained his theory about lawyer bashing to the Globe and Mail: "There is probably a bit of envy,"Howlett said. "There may also be that insecurity you get when there is someone in the room who is smarter than you." Translation: "You make lawyer jokes because you're jealous and a dumbass." Under the headline "Self serving and self-defeating" Lawyer Jordan Furlong, writes in SLAW which bills itself as Canada online legal magazine: "Seriously? The PR agency's head actually told the country's national newspaper that people are jealous because lawyers are so much smarter than they are?" "Don't worry Ontario Law Society. It's just 95% of the lawyers that give the rest a bad name!" Lawyer joke in the Globe and Mail letters section below a story about Lawyer Jokes. If lawyers are trying to change the impression they are an arrogant and disconnected elite, a comment to the CBC about the campaign by the OBA President Morris Chochla may not help: "If I go on the golf course and someone wants to tell me a lawyer joke, I turn around. I do not like lawyer jokes," Chochla said. I'm sure the image of the poor OBA president having to turn around routinely on the golf course will surely bring tears to the eyes of average Canadian. But whether the campaign is effective or not, does the OBA have a point? Is it true that everyone just makes fun of lawyers until they need one? Has lawyer joking gone too far? One of the things that characterizes some lawyer jokes is kind of jocular violence where the punch line celebrates the mass drowning or killing of lawyers. Q: What do you call 25 lawyers buried up to their chins in cement? A: Not enough cement. So it's disturbing to note there have been a number of very unfunny attacks on lawyers. Here are just some recent ones. This January Mark Hummels, a well-liked Arizona-based lawyer, was murdered along with a client in Phoenix. In 1993, a possible disgruntled client shot eight people to death and committed suicide at the law firm Petitt and Martin. On February 3, the 28-year-old daughter of lawyer Randal Quan was murdered by the now infamous Christopher Dorner. While this is likely the work of the mentally unstable, lawyer bashing could be a factor. Lawyers often blame public resentment of lawyers on the adversarial legal system. Lawyers must defend the most despicable members of society. But I think the public finds the entire legal system adversarial for a completely different reason. They feel both lawyers and the legal system are generally stacked unfairly against them. The number of people defending themselves in Canadian courts is reaching record levels possibly because people avoid lawyers and can't afford them. Lawyers may be the taking some of the heat for people's problems with the system. Or maybe they just make a convenient scapegoat because they're so often in the public eye? Perhaps a study of the structure of jokes might shed light on the issue. A contemporary theory of humour is based on the rather fun-killing concept of pattern recognition. British Evolutionary Theorist and humour expert Alastair Clarke, explains it in like this: humour can occur "when the brain recognises a pattern that surprises it." Here's an example: Q: What's the difference between a good lawyer and a bad lawyer? A: A bad lawyer makes your case drag on for years. A good lawyer makes it last even longer. The reversed pattern is a surprise. And if it's funny, it's because it reveals a sardonic truth; that good or bad, lawyers are against us. The key thing here is the joke only works if the surprising pattern is perceived as real. So according to the laws of humour, if you really wanted to counter lawyer jokes, instead of turning your back when you hear them, you might be better off trying reduce the very patterns that breed them. You could do this simply by showing you were working to make the legal system more fair, more accessible and workable for the average person. Or you could do what Marshfield Mass.-based Lawyer, John S. Keating does on his website every morning. He puts up the "Lawyer Joke of the Day." "Just to show that some lawyers can laugh at themselves."   Follow Albert Nerenberg on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Laughologist1 FOLLOW CANADA Like 106k Follow us on Facebook Get updates from HuffPost Canada posted directly to your News Feed.   Subscribe   SOCIAL NEWS FOLLOW US Connect with your friends Check out stories you might like, and see what your friends are sharing!

I know it's anal but if you're writing it down the full stop in the original one posted vs the comma makes a big difference (obviously 0 difference if you read it out!). Also then the joke doesn't relate to lawyers specifically, it could be anything: I walked past a gravestone the other day, and it read "Here lies Betty, a mother and a good wife" and I wondered to myself "Why did they bury 3 people in one grave?!". (In which case the funnier still joke would be: "My wife recently passed away, and I had to go to view the gravestone before they buried her to make sure I liked it. I saw it and read "Here lies Betty, a good wife and a good mother". I told them it was totally unacceptable, when asked why I asked them "Well, who are the other two people you were planning on burying with her?!") Then the joke is what is written on the gravestone, rather than the idea that a lawyer couldn't possibly be a good man, because you've included the name. In fact in the joke I posted you could even leave out the name and go with: I walked past a gravestone the other day, and it read "Here lies a lawyer and a good man" and I wondered to myself "Why did they bury 2 people in one grave?!". The above joke the punchline is "the joke teller didn't possibly think that a lawyer could also be a good man" whereas the example with the name essentially tries to have two punchlines ("the man mis-read the grave" and "lawyers aren't good people"). TL;DR If you put the name in and make it 3 people you confuse the punch line. The joke needs to be simple and therefore either be funny because the grave was mis-read (in which case why post it specifically in a lawyer joke thread) or it's about lawyers unable to be good men, not both. permalink parent [+] Notmyrealname -1 points 0 points 1 point 1 year ago  (2 children) [–]Notmyrealname -1 points0 points1 point 1 year ago sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted on I got it.

Here's my guess: Most professions are supportive (all doctors, plumbers, crafts, tour guides, burger-flippers and golf pros are ON YOUR SIDE!).

This negative sentiment has been around a while: "First thing, let's kill all the Lawyers" is a shakespearean quote.

They haven't done anything spectacular. They either work hard at what they do or they don't. Either way, it doesn't attract the attention of the public. This holds true for society in general. Now lets apply this to lawyers. The stereotypes (based upon how they are viewed by the masses, meaning based on the well known lawyers) of a lawyer is that they are crooked. They're sharks and in it for the money. Why is this? Because the well known lawyers are the ones who get the "obviously guilty" criminals off scotch free or because they take money even though they know that there isn't a real case to argue. Let's talk about each one individually. The "crooked" lawyers. Always wanting the victory over morality. First of all, THEY'RE BEING PAID TO DO THEIR JOB. If you got paid to play football would you want to lose? No. It doesn't feel good. Of course they want to win, it's human nature. It doesn't matter if it is a criminal case determined by a jury or a claims issue determined by a judge (this irked me. Claims aren't jury determined, as was stated above.) they will want to win. So client X is being portrayed as guilty just because he's on trial (which is a serious issue. Many news stations will find them guilty the second they are arrested. That's stupid. It warps the community's views and thoughts.). Client X hires lawyer Y. Lets say that X is guilty. The majority of the time (as in around 80% for most places) the job of lawyer Y is to get client X the bet deal possible. Try to get a deferred or avoid in time. The idiotic 20% will try to fight it. Now here comes the stereotype: Lawyer Y will talk about the case in a good light, try to get more money out of him. That's because this individual is a bad person. This is not dependent upon his occupation. He is a dick. People hear about this because its a bad thing. You don't ever hear "My lawyer didn't screw me over!" Why not? Because 1) bad news is spread more than good news and 2) people think that lawyers are expensive. News flash: Law school costs a fuck ton, as well as renewal classes to keep practicing, AND a yearly fee to keep your license. permalink parent [+] CheersletsSmoke -5 points -4 points -3 points 1 year ago  (3 children) [–]CheersletsSmoke -5 points-4 points-3 points 1 year ago sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted on Unless you are about to come up with something that really ties your point together just leave it bc nobody from nowhere has answered my question sufficiently, and you werent exactly on the right track from what i can tell. permalink parent [+] Alexbo8138 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 year ago *  (1 child) [–]Alexbo8138 3 points4 points5 points 1 year ago* sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted on 2/3 done.

By law, a lawyer is required to put his full support behind his client. A lawyer can choose to fire his client or not take the case, but outside of that, a lawyer must knowingly defend murderers and rapists, using every trick they know of. They can't have an attack of conscience and come clean if they find out their client is actually guilty. So lots of people claim lawyers are amoral. The US justice system relies on money. It involves long processes with lots of fees, and the legal system is ridiculously complex to the point where a lawyer is not only necessary, but requires so much expertise that they are pretty expensive. To us laypeople, it frequently seems like a circus, and we're paying out the nose to the performers. All in all, the pursuit of understanding of the law, and the knowledge to properly navigate the judicial system, are very honorable on their own. But I think the extra crap that comes with being a lawyer really makes it stink. permalink parent [+] CheersletsSmoke -1 points 0 points 1 point 1 year ago  (2 children) [–]CheersletsSmoke -1 points0 points1 point 1 year ago sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted on Right on. Also, I think that there is a certain "lower class" of lawyers that take cases that give useful attorneys a bad name.

Mine's based on altruism: Public Defenders are amazing selfless bastard angels who get nowhere near the respect they deserve. Judges and trial lawyers next (atticus finch as archtype, but it is important to defend everyone with zeal), then ambulance chasers, patent troll lawyers, corporate guns, and corporate counsel. They don't do a moment of altruistic anything, but like everyone to think they're doing 'high class' stuff.

Kirk Makin - JUSTICE REPORTER The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday, Feb. 06 2013, 9:44 PM EST Last updated Thursday, Feb. 07 2013, 7:35 AM EST Comments Print / License AA What do you call 18,000 determined lawyers with a generous war chest? Answer: the Ontario Bar Association, which, fed up with being the butt of negative jokes about their profession, is launching a public-relations campaign on Thursday. The object: to persuade people that, far from their time-worn image as greedy and over-aggressive manipulators, lawyers are actually problem-solvers, pillars of their communities and an indispensable cog in a healthy democracy.

Courtesy of Chloe Wolman Watch Video: Job-search tips from an unemployed Canadian lawyer in L.A. Two years in the making, the campaign was devised by a Toronto marketing company, Agency59. It will include a social media component where lawyers can tell their individual stories, print and radio advertising, and poster ads placed in prominent positions such as airports. The Ontario campaign comes at a time when many lawyers and judges have raised soul-searching questions about access to the courts and the high costs of litigation. Bar associations in other provinces are watching closely with a view to launching similar campaigns, said OBA president Morris Chochla. Why are lawyers – so essential in so many critical life situations – held in such low regard? How is it that a Google search of “lawyer jokes” can return 2.8 million results, most of them equating lawyers with dishonesty, avarice and exploitation? Lawyers point to the confrontational nature of litigation and the fact that they are closely associated with their clients’ battles. “In an adversarial situation involving family law, criminal law or civil litigation, you have a client and his lawyer on one side, and the other client with his lawyer on the other side,” Mr. Chochla said. “That is what ends up in the press and on the radio.” Brian Howlett, creative director for Agency59, said that lawyers’ intelligence level and confidence may also be a turnoff. “There is probably a bit of envy,” Mr. Howlett said. “There may also be that insecurity you get when there is someone in the room who is smarter than you. The insight that stood out for us was that we all speak well of our individual lawyers, so why doesn’t it transfer when people look at the whole industry?” Sharon Jeethan, a 35-year-old lawyer at the Toronto firm of Derstine Penman LLP, said she has grown used to hearing her profession derided whenever lawyers are mentioned at social events. Ms. Jeethan, who formerly worked as a court registrar and legal assistant, said she emerged from law school last year bracing herself for the social castigation that defence lawyers in particular learn to live with. “Criminal defence lawyers are the bottom of the barrel,” she said. Not only are most of them poorly paid, Ms. Jeethan said, but the revulsion people feel for accused criminals is transferred to their lawyers. “People say that lawyers are liars; that they are manipulative people who will turn any shade of truth gray,” she said. “It’s a sad thing because at the end of the day, this is a helping profession. You are an advocate for someone, representing their interests in society and in the courtroom.” Ms. Jeethan said that, once she identifies herself as a lawyer, people tend to open up to her. “I have yet to meet the person who learns I am a lawyer and suddenly doesn’t take me into their confidence,” she said. “They tell me their deepest, darkest secrets and want my advice.” Paul Sweeney, past president of the OBA, said Ms. Jeethan’s experience is the norm. He said lawyers feel deeply underappreciated for their social contributions and the role they play in solving problems. In fact, Mr. Sweeney said, lawyers devote a great deal of time to negotiating and mediating outside the courtroom; contributing legal expertise to charities and community boards; and, as politicians, helping ensure that legislation and regulations are legally sound. “We are trained to think critically about issues; to argue appropriately; to advocate on behalf of a position,” Mr. Sweeney said. “Those are skills we value. Words are what we use.” The theme of the OBA campaign is focused on what inspired individual lawyers to attend law school. Members will be encouraged to share their own testimonials on a website and to incorporate their narratives into Facebook accounts and firm websites. “The typical campaign would have painted them as the champion of justice and put them on a pedestal,” Mr. Howlett said. “Our objective is to humanize the lawyer, to take them off the pedestal.” In one of the poster ads, lawyer Carl Fleck reveals that he idolized a lawyer who represented his family in a personal injury claim after a serious car accident. “Life has come full circle, as I have had over the last 45 years the privilege of representing accident victims and assisting them in obtaining fair compensation, hopefully, in turn enabling some of them to achieve their own individual dreams,” Mr. Fleck said. The success of the PR campaign will be gauged through public surveys conducted at its beginning and end. “We knew this couldn’t be done overnight,” Mr. Howlett said. “We aren’t launching a new flavour of Coca-Cola, where people decide in a week if they are going to like it. We are working toward an attitudinal shift.”   Can lawyers rehabilitate their image? Or is their profession just misunderstood? Share your thoughts here.   STOP ME IF YOU’VE HEARD THIS ONE ...

THEY DON’T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR What’s the problem with lawyer jokes?
