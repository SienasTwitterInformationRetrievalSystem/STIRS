Smith|Feb. 2, 2011 4:34 pm Google +1 Email This past year was the Mexican drug war's bloodiest yet, with over 15,000 dead. Even former President Vincente Fox recently called for full-out legalization of all drugs: "Prohibition didn't work in the Garden of Eden. Adam ate the apple." But U.S. politicians seem determined to continue waging a bloody and fruitless war on our southern border. Obama's continued support for Bush's disasterous Mérida Initiative to fund Mexico's drug war is bad enough, but Republicans are telling The New York Times that they want him to go even harder: Both Mexican and American officials, who say the two countries have never worked closer in fighting crime, are facing growing pressure to prove that their strategy is working. With Republicans now in control of the House of Representatives, the Obama administration will face renewed scrutiny to account for the $1.4 billion, multiyear Merida Initiative, the cornerstone of American aid in Mexico’s drug fight.  “Right now I am concerned whether the administration is focused on giving Merida a chance,” said Representative Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who is the new chairman of a House subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. He says that while he supports the initiative, he will call hearings over what he considers the slow pace in which it has been carried out. “There is a lack of execution,” Mr. Mack said. “We are going to find out why this is.” I wonder which Republican the Sinaloa cartel is backing for 2012?

They would likely argue that while the Commerce Clause can justify such legislation, they would not support the intent of the legislation. Libertarians are a unique bunch, whether right or wrong, in that we believe that some principles should not be violated, regardless of good intentions or even positive aggregate outcomes, because it would entail the deprivation of the individual's rights. Most people, from my experience, are pragmatic and believe that intentions and outcomes are superior and therefore all issues are up for public debate and implementation. reply to this log in or register to reply MNG|2.2.11 @ 11:31PM|# I'm not sure I would give you that advantage.

At least the Prohibitionists had the grace (and the grit) to do the right thing Constitutionally, and get an amendment to grant the government power it did not otherwise have. Since Roosevelt castrated the Court, we don't even require a societal consensus on the expansion of government power. That's what the amendment process guarantees: a broad consensus.

The US considers its efforts their a 'big success'. In the end, all they really did was move a major center for trafficking (Columbia to Miami for example) to Mexico. Now Calderon is fighting the cartels who are also fighting amongst themselves resulting in 15000 deaths last year, and over 30000 during the last 3 years. Maybe Calderon will 'win', but all that means is that the trafficking will move somewhere else and the process will begin again. I'd almost want it to come here to the US so the population could truly see the results of the polices its government as so successfully sold to them. Then again, US institutions are probably too strong for the cartels to take hold of the way they've managed to in Mexico. All that said, it isn't necessarily true that "all the violence, extortion, murder and mayhem is concentrated" in Mexico. The drug trade fuels the Taliban and a helluva lot of corruption within the Karzai regime.

Drug gangsters are killing each other for the dollars, not the drugs. Just like alcohol during the 18th amendment. People like to alter their mental state, hence alcohol and pot. Not much harm in doing so, especially with pot. People are not going to change their preference for an occasional buzz. So, whose fault is it that strong demand results in huge profits for drug dealers? The answer is clear, it is the drug warriors who have caused this carnage. They wanted a war and they got one. Probably what we are seeing in Mexico is more just a battle than a war; look for the war to expand into the US and Canada, and yes it will still be the drug warriors fault. reply to this log in or register to reply fortyouncer|2.3.11 @ 12:48AM|# Would you be willing to give up all fruit?

What happens to professional criminals after Libertopia is achieved? With drugs, prostitution, and gambling legalized all over the place, what will they do? Not trolling, serious question. Big Pharma will take over cocaine, ADM and MonSantos will start growing everyone's favorite herb, strip clubs will start offering takeout, bars will bring the roulette wheels out into the open, etc. So where will the criminals go? Going off Prohibition, we see that the competitive advantage a gangster has is his willingness to break the law. After Prohibition, the syndicate went into other profitable illegal markets. So what will they do if everything is made legal? reply to this log in or register to reply Amakudari|2.3.11 @ 4:22AM|# So what will they do if everything is made legal? Well, legal things, I guess. What, are they going to move into kidnapping as a viable long-term business plan? There is no crime more lucrative than drugs in the US. I mean, if marijuana alone were legalized, it's already a $36 billion domestic industry, which is $300 per household. You'd be hard-pressed to make that up with other crime. Prostitution, for reference, is $14 billion, so our gangsters would have to expand the industry by multiple orders. And, of course, your argument involves prostitution's legalization. So either they'd step it up by massively expanding robbery, kidnapping, bribery, murder for hire, etc., which is ridiculously risky with mostly low returns, and the new breed of criminals would be drawn to that life just as much as selling a dimebag on the corner, or crime would shrink. And it's a sunk cost, anyway. Legalization would move people out of the black market and violence immediately, and some of its effects would be felt over the longer term as the profits from crime fell. reply to this log in or register to reply Mr Whipple|2.3.11 @ 6:28AM|# I think it was John Gotti that said something like, "we give people the things that they want, that the government won't let them have".

Since Mexican president Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006 and called the armed forces into the fight against the so-called cartels, prohibition-related violence has killed more than 35,000 people, including more than 15,000 last year. The increasing militarization of the drug war and the arrest of dozens of high-profile drug traffickers have failed to stem the flow of drugs -- or the violence -- whatsoever. The Merida initiative, which provides $1.4 billion over three years for the US to assist the Mexican government with training, equipment and intelligence, has so far failed to make a difference. Here are a few of the latest developments in Mexico's drug war: Black market profits fuel deadly violence. Who could ever have predicted that? (Image via Wikimedia) Wednesday, January 26 In Tamaulipas, an American missionary was shot and killed when gunmen opened fire on her truck at an illegal roadblock. Nancy Davis, 59, had been involved in missionary work in Mexico for the last 30 years. Tamaulipas is a stronghold of drug trafficking organizations in Mexico and has seen drastic increases in violence over the last year as the Zetas Organization battles its former masters, the Gulf Cartel. Friday, January 28 In Ciudad Juarez, two federal police officers were charged with killing one of Ciudad Juarez’s mayor's bodyguards during an incident the previous week. In Veracruz, 33 ex-mayors have been ordered arrested on corruption charges. In Pantanal, Nayarit, four men were killed during a firefight between two rival gangs. The gunmen were heavily armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers. The incident took place after one group of gunmen attacked a safe house used by another group. Pantanal is located in the municipality of Xalisco, which is well known as a hub for traffickers who export black tar heroin to the United States. Saturday, January 29 In Monterrey , five gunmen were killed after attacking an army convoy in the suburb of Santa Catarina. Two innocent bystanders were wounded by grenades during the gun battle. Near Acapulco, a mutilated body was discovered hanging from an overpass bridge was spans the busy Acapulco-Mexico City highway. The unidentified victim had been severely beaten and tortured. Monday, January 31 In Mexico City, prosecutors announced a $658,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of two suspects in the massacre of 72 migrants last August. The two men are known as "The Coyote" and "The Scorpion" and are thought to be members of the Zetas Organization. Eight other Zetas suspected of taking part in the massacre are already in custody. In Ciudad Juarez, at least 11 people were murdered in different parts of the city. Among the dead was a 16-year old girl who succumbed to her wounds after being shot by federal police alongside her 13-year old sister, who was wounded. According to a tally by local newspaper El Diario, 216 people were murdered in Ciudad Juarez in the first month of 2011. Last year the city had 3,111 murders take place. Wednesday, February 2 In Guadalajara, suspected cartel gunmen used grenades, burned vehicles and created makeshift blockades in a series of seven incidents across the city. A policeman and two transportation workers were wounded. The attacks seem to be in retaliation for the recent arrest of drug gang members. In Monterrey, a federal police officer and three gunmen were killed during an attack on an army convoy in the suburb of Apodaca. Three policemen were wounded and an unknown number of suspects were taken into custody. In a separate incident in Monterrey, three other gunmen were killed by federal police personnel.

Learn more » Tweet An interactive map of Mexico's security crisis AS THE tally of murders linked to organised crime has risen over the past four years in Mexico, analysts have warned that insecurity is spreading to areas that were previously unaffected. The Mexican government insists that, on the contrary, the violence remains highly concentrated. Who is right? The answer, oddly, is both. In 2007, the first full year of the crackdown against the “cartels”, as the mafias are known, 70% of homicides linked to organised crime took place in just 4% of the country's municipalities. In 2010, again, 70% of killings took place in only 3% of municipalities. If anything, the violence has become slightly more concentrated over time. But total annual killings have risen dramatically. The total for 2010 was more than five times that of 2007 (though there was an encouraging dip towards the end of the year). So although 97% of the country still sees only 30% of all the violence, that 30% represents a much larger number in gross terms than it did four years ago. The map above illustrates the paradox that violence in Mexico has spread extensively, while remaining highly concentrated. Previous BP and the oil price: Black gold, but at what price?

Recommend 174 Report Permalink ArbyH Feb 3rd 2011 0:13 GMT The "War on Drugs" as it relates to marijuana is a fool’s errand. Legalizing marijuana would solve many current problems and actually create some benefits for the public good. Certainly the current way the government deals with this problem only prolongs the problem. Marijuana never should have been included on the list of dangerous drugs. Marijuana isn’t dangerous, and it isn’t a feeder drug. I believe the La Guardia Committee Report made a clear case on the harmlessness of marijuana and exposed the blatant propagandized lies. Everyone knows how wrongfully propagandized, distorted, and racially motivated the law enforcement efforts were in the America's anti-marijuana campaign. Harry Anslinger was an ambitious, lying, and deceitful man with a bureaucrat’s interest in the slander and disinformation of marijuana. Other organized interests were against hemp as a resource: Logging wanted to capture the paper industry; cotton growers and synthetic cloth manufactures, such as DuPont, were also to blame for this inclusion while trying to eliminate hemp fiber competition. Legalizing marijuana would: -Cause the black market in marijuana to be gone, along with the violence related to it. You can’t beat that. -All of the marijuana money going south would stop, and remain here to be spent legally in our own economy. That is 60% of a cartel’s income. Losing that would be a serious blow to these groups. -Law enforcement, judicial, and incarceration expenditures of public funds for this would no longer be needed- Free the people. -The growing on and damaging of public lands would end, as people would rather grow it at home, ending the illegal cartels involvement. -People with medical needs would be able to seek some small comfort there. - (IMO) A decrease in drunk driving statistics would occur. People would soon realize that they enjoy marijuana more than the oncoming sickness of drinking, thus the non alcoholic would drink less, and be safer to the public concern overall. Another very important factor: Legalizing marijuana would allow for the acceptance of a large group of productive and responsible American citizens who only differ from everyone else in one intelligent way: they intuitively prefer thought stimulating marijuana to the dangerous sloppiness and oncoming sickness of drinking. Liquor lobbyists and the pharmaceutical companies would fight against legalization of marijuana for their self preservation reasons, as would the DEA. The DEA is a major recipient in the forfeiture of assets game, and they love the power they have, and they, along with the prison guards, and Wackenhut, want to remain fully staffed and budgeted. Let me stress that marijuana is safer and more enjoyable then liquor. Liquor companies know this, but do not want the public to adapt and adopt a safer smarter way. I’m no expert but, if people self medicated with marijuana wouldn’t that reduce the need for Zoloft and a dozen other mood drugs? Certainly there is little better with coming to grips with PTSD than the herbal remedy. The government’s issue is: Who will grow it and sell it? How do we manage it? How do we tax it? How can we monopolize it, diminish it‘s quality, and tax it for as much as we can get away with? Those are greedy selfish interests, and as usual the government should leave it alone and stop looking at things in that self serving manner. The government needs to stop playing omnipotent God. In most cases government regulation creates more problems than it solves. I propose that American citizens, of legal age, be allowed to "grow their own". If every citizen of age that desired could grow say 12 mature plants for personal use, then all illegal black markets would dry up. The surplus would cause marijuana to not have much monetary value. One economic plus for my proposal is that good citizens who enjoy marijuana are a smart proud group of sociable people and will invest money into growing supplies. Your average proud grower will invest a few hundred dollars, or more, in the domestic economy to be able to properly grow, and show off, their little crop. This expenditure times 22 million people and you have a major boost in our economy, instead of the current hemorrhage of funds going to illegal drug lords, and the ugliness that comes with that. In conclusion: the current way the government deals with marijuana only prolongs the problem. If profit is to be made a black market will always exist. It is high time Americans stood up for freedom and demanded these repressive marijuana laws be changed, ending decades of unjust persecution. Give marijuana back to the people and freedom and liberty itself will turn what was an ugly problem into a favorable outcome. I can not get on a soap box and argue the merit of other drugs, but as far as marijuana I will defend it and speak my peace as a freedom loving American.

Having lived in Cabo San Lucas and Guymas, and having sailed those waters extensively, I have never heard it called the 'Gulf of California' by anyone and nor have I seen it referred to on a nautical chart, as anything other than the Sea of Cortes?.... Recommend 159 Report Permalink okne Feb 2nd 2011 23:47 GMT @J. Kemp, So because Americans use drugs, it is our 'war on drugs'? Or efforts to enforce laws, you agree with or not, is the cause of this? That is the most ridiculous notion I have seen repeated over and over again. Mexico is a country with a strong population, generally very nice natural resources in the Gulf, and entry into a free-trade agreement that Canada has embraced and grown from. It is also a country that has high endemic drug use amongst its own population, who exports mass amounts of drugs to America and Europe (and not just marijuana, which I am ambivalent about), who exports about 6 million (minimum) stable illegal immigrants to America who then send home remittances worth about 20-30% of Mexico's GDP, a nation who has had many opportunities to turn things around. Yes, some Americans like drugs, and some Americans like guns. Do I agree with either? No, but they are the written laws, and here they are enforced. If you have issues with the 2nd ammendment, that's one thing, to blame Americans for embracing a centuries old part of the constitution for the motives of massive drug cartels who will fuel their trade with violence of any means, is absurd. I get that it is trendy to blame America but have some perspective and some respect for human nature; the violence and greed and lust for weapons is an intrinsic characteristic of Mexican criminal elements, who sell out their own countrymen. And unfortunately, they exploit the laws of my nation, illegally. I would seriously like to know what your answer to the war on drugs would be, when you share a large border with a country who has no reason to use them as a major export, but does. Legalize everything? Give them economic aid? We have shared millions of free dollars and technical expertise with the Mexican oil company to help their operations 30 years ago, they responded by 'nationalizing' it even further and in those decades its investment and expertise has gone down hill so fast that it is having trouble meeting production goals on wells that are full of oil, or drilling at new sites in a oil rich region. We included them in a free trade agreement that sent hundreds of factories, with hundreds of thousands of jobs, with a chance to develop a middle class and demand and better standards. Did we enjoy the cheap labor? Of course we did, but NAFTA gave them a much bigger chance to expand, to open our market to them, to allow investment in them. We didn't need such a large agreement just to use them, as can be seen in how many multinational manufacturers now work. I'm sick of this criticism. Blame the war on drugs? We opened ourselves to Mexico in many ways many times trying to elevate them, that it has come to this is surely partly to blame on a minority of our population's drug use.... but our war on drugs? We tried the olive branch and the greenback before, they didn't take pal. Apparently these days America cannot be recognized for doing anything good ever. That's fine by me, just makes me work harder.

Or efforts to enforce laws, you agree with or not, is the cause of this?" Well... yes. The current criminal approach on drugs is the reason why there are criminals behind the drug trade (with the collateral damage of 30k bodies south of your border in the last few years). The US has used the same strategy over decades, apparently without realizing how futile it is and without realizing how it is pouring billions into the pockets of mobsters. Recommend 151 Report Permalink jvictor1789 Feb 3rd 2011 1:25 GMT Regarding the Sea of Cortes of course a place is named in the way its inhabitants see fit.That is why Bombay is Mumbai,Peking is Beijing and Kinshasha is (thankfully) not Leopoldville. Google just tries to do an approximative job but of course it is not a World Official Baptizer dripping sacred water on the planet. Imagine if Google or its future successor was spanish-based it could name San Francisco "El Presidio" (the prison colony). Of course should it be mexican-based it would simply call California and Texas "Northern Mexico". Both names Gulf of California and Sea of Cortes are used in Mexico but Sea of Cortes is more commonly used in the states that border it, and has a far more romantic ring to it. Regarding Okne`s posting I think we may need to make a few corrections. Most of us know Mexico has a GDP of one trillion dollars, the 14th largest in the world. That is in real dollars. If you take into account cheaper prices in Mexico and do the PPP adjustment(see CIA`s figures, for example) this rises to around 1.4 trillion dollars, 11th largest in the world, ahead of Canada, Spain and South Korea. Mexico City alone is the second largest metropolis in the World after Tokyo-Yokohama, and its GDP, as a single city, is the 8th largest in the world behind only such places as Tokyo, New York, L.A. , London or Paris. Remittances into Mexico are worth 25 bn $. My friend, we may not need a calculator to see that amounts to only two per cent of the mexican economy, not the 20-30% you posted. You also write "Mexico exports 6 million(sic) stable(sic) illegal immigrant to America" ... "stable!" Now I understand. You must be speaking of farm animals, pigs, cows and so on who are the ones who usually live in a stable. Indeed you could bite them upon seeing them in your local supermarket.

The real paradox to us is, how can we continue to live in one of the safest cities in America and be only a short bridge walk across from the most dangerous city in Mexico? We wonder when the other shoe will drop. Many other El Paso residents refuse to go to Juarez anymore for fear of the violence, and the tourist trade has just about dried up.

He's right: a minuscule portion of foreign tourists have been affected by Mexico's violence. But on Jan. 26, a day after Calderón's proclamation, a U.S. missionary was murdered in a part of northeastern Mexico that is rife with narcocriminals, reportedly shot in the head by men in a black truck who tried to stop the missionary and her husband on a road near the U.S.-Mexico border. The victim, Nancy Shuman Davis, 59, was not a tourist, nor was she killed anywhere near one of Mexico's tourist zones. But her tragedy helps explain why Calderón is on the tourism offensive. With more civilians, including foreigners and U.S. citizens, getting caught in Mexico's drug-war cross fire, a death like Davis' can cast a pall, unfairly or not, over south-of-the-border vacation plans. In January, major cruise lines like Royal Caribbean and Carnival announced plans to reduce or even stop voyages from California to Mexico, citing passenger jitters. "People here have certainly been concerned," says Janet Rhines, owner of Windy City Travel in Chicago, which books a large number of vacations in Mexico. "I do encourage them to be open-minded and understand that most resort areas are safe. But the Mexican government needs to get out there with a better information program." (See pictures of Mexico's drug tunnels.) Calderón seems to have gotten the message. That's largely because Mexico can't afford another repeat of 2009, when international tourism to the country plunged 15%, to $11.3 billion from $13.3 billion in 2008, thanks to the global recession and a swine-flu scare as well as narcoviolence. Such a drop is no small thing in a country, the world's 10th most visited, where tourism is the third largest source of foreign income, behind migrant-worker remittances and oil  especially at a time when those revenues are also in sharp decline. It's important, too, because any hit to Mexico's economy, which shrank 6.5% in 2009, risks sending more unemployed Mexicans into the lucrative but bloody drug-trafficking industry. Both Mexico's economy and foreign tourism, which was up more than 7% in 2010, had a healthy rebound last year, when almost 10 million international travelers visited. But much of the tourism recovery came via sometimes steep price discounts that Mexican hotels, airlines and restaurants can't sustain for too many more years. The trick is to convince the world that Mexico's spectacular drug carnage  more than 15,000 narco-related murders last year  is mostly confined to northern Mexico, especially in border cities like Juárez, and that it doesn't represent the general crime situation in Mexico, which has a considerably lower murder rate than countries like Brazil do. In theory, that shouldn't be difficult, and the 2010 figures indicate that Mexico's narcos aren't scaring away that many visitors. As travel experts like Rhines note, tourists at Mexican resort destinations like Los Cabos on the Baja peninsula, Puerto Vallarta on the Pacific Coast and Cancún on the Caribbean Mayan Riviera are insulated from the shootouts. (See pictures of Culiacán, the home of Mexico's drug-trafficking industry.) But Mexico's narcoviolence is known for its frightening gore, and when it's visited on even one well-known tourist site  like Acapulco, where in the first week of January 14 slain and decapitated bodies were dumped at a shopping center, or Mazatlán, where a week later a Canadian tourist was shot in the leg by a stray bullet from a gangland execution  foreigners considering a Mexican vacation often don't make distinctions. As it is, the Disney and Holland America cruise lines last week announced that they're canceling stops in Mazatlán, and the tanks and masked soldiers now patrolling La Costera, Acapulco's main drag, are hardly a tourist-brochure hook. To help counter its dependence on foreign ships, the Mexican Tourism Ministry announced the creation of a national line, Ocean Star Cruises, which, starting in April, plans to dock at six of the country's Pacific Coast sites. One of the ironies of Calderón's Year of Tourism proclamation is his plan to "work very strongly with international media to show Mexico as it should be shown, a true natural, cultural and historical beauty." This despite the fact that he often blames the international media and its drug-war coverage for much of Mexico's image problems. And when he's not blaming foreign journalists, he's chiding Mexicans for badmouthing their country, as he did last spring when he complained that "Mexico is demonized and reproached, even by Mexicans," adding that he'd "never heard a Brazilian speak ill of Brazil," host of both the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. (See pictures of Mexico City police fighting crime.) All of which is a reminder that the dour Calderón could use some of the Amazon-size media savvy possessed by former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who left office in January. Foreigners might be less wary of Mexico, for example, if they were more aware of Calderón's impressive judicial and police reforms, but his distrust for the international media has kept that message from resonating as strongly as it should  not a smart strategy when you're competing with severed heads for attention. Calderón is right: perception does matter. And so does the leader who is selling it.  With reporting by Dolly Mascareñas / Acapulco See TIME's Pictures of the Week.

Vanity Fair profiles The eXile: "Gutsy...visceral...serious journalism...abusive, defamatory...poignant...paranoid...and right!" MSNBC: Mark Ames and Yasha Levine Broke the Koch Brothers' Takeover of America War Nerd Mark Ames Yasha Levine Eileen Jones John Dolan Headlines About Search @exiledonline The Mexican Drug War / February 1, 2011 Mexico’s Narco-War 2011: The Gulf Cartel Chops Up the Zetas By Pancho Montana The eXiled’s special Drug War Correspondent MONTERREY, NUEVO LEÓN–Here we go again, a new year and a fresh new wave of narco-war porn to go along with it. If you’ve been paying close attention to the drug war in Monterrey (and if you’re reading this you must have) you will have noticed that the new year has only meant more violence, more drugs and more black SUVs shooting it out in the streets, 3-sided full-bore firefights between rival narco gangs and the army, pretty much like a Michael Bay movie. Life in Monterrey right now is like living in the set of Bad Boys 2. Non-stop car-chases and multiple shootouts, but no point to it, no reason for the apparently  random, senseless violence. Shit, MTV should make a reality show based on Monterrey or even better, a “Tampico Shores” show, only in this version we get to watch the entire cast having their bodies dissolved in acid. That’s what it looks like from here, anyway. But I´ve come to figuring out how to follow this mess and make some sense of the violence. For one thing, all these small acts of random violence only make sense if you consider them in the context of the bigger picture: first, you make a note of who gets killed, how, where… and after a few days, when you get a sense of the bigger picture, you have a pretty clear view of the situation. First, let’s go over what happened last year: 2010 was the bloodiest, most violent year in recent history in my home state of Nuevo Leon–Monterrey is the capital of this state, for you short-memoried gringos out there. Official figures estimate there’ve been around 700 deaths in the wars between cops and narcos, but knowing how the Zetas operate in this state it’s safe to say the real figure is at least double or triple that amount. The violence has only accelerated due to the ugly split between the big players—the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel–a break-up that’s dragged the entire state into in a war-like situation, in which every day the news was filled with stories of more shootouts, more executions, more kidnappings, more good ol’ family feuding between the two cartels. It wasn’t all bad. 2010 was also the year that the Mexican Marines first swooped into the scene. For the first few years of the narco-wars, the burden of the drug war fell almost entirely on the Mexican Army. The Federal Police keeps restructuring and trying to clean up its act, but every time keeps failing to get rid of insider corruption, which over the last few years has resulted in such things as killing entire families in highway checkpoints. By some accounts the Federales have become increasingly infiltrated with organized crime group corruption and money, although not nearly to the same extent as local police and law enforcement has. The first big break for the Mexican Marines came when they bagged Arturo Beltrán Leyva in his hideout in a Cuernavaca condo. From then on they’ve been spearheading the military’s offensive against the drug cartels. I’ve seen the Marines myself, of course. The first thing you notice about the Marines is how tall they are. It’s not just a coincidence– there’s actually a height requirement for any potential recruit in the Marines, who must be at least 1.80 meters tall (5’11”). They are a bigger and deadlier version of your average Army grunt, and they’re stone-cold killers to boot. So the ebb and flow of last year was basically big acts of violence, followed by spillover violence the next few days, followed by an Army or Marines operation that would capture and kill a lot of criminals–Zetas most of the time, and every now and then a big time Zeta cell leader or jefe de plaza would get killed or captured. The violence never really calmed down. Quite the opposite, nowadays just seeing or hearing shootouts seems to be the most common topic of conversation among regios (Monterrey natives). But then last December the violence escalated to a new level, reaching the boiling point with the false-rescue and subsequent hanging of a female kidnapper linked to a Zetas cell in our state that specialized in kidnappings for ransom. At first what we heard was that this Zeta chick had been rescued when she was just about to leave the gates of El Topo Chico prison inside an ambulance, after she’d pretended to be sick and in need of hospitalization. Everyone thought that the “rescue” of this underworld Zeta chick was just another example of the total ineptitude of the government of PRI candidate Rodrigo Medina, the pretty-boy who was just elected State Governor of Nuevo Leon. But there was something strange about the way she was sprung from the ambulance: like, why her? She didn´t seem to be important, she was an unknown before her rescue. Then on  the last day of December her body turned up in the 6.00AM news: She was found hanging from a pedestrian crossing bridge–on her naked torso you could read the name “YAHIR”, apparently the name of her boyfriend, a Zeta, from the same cell. The killing of “the Redhead” as she was known, signaled the start of a new narco-war offensive launched by the Gulf Cartel. “Nueva Federación” or “The New Federation,” is what they call the new alliance of sicario (“assassin”) cells between La Familia Michoacana and The Gulf Cartel. They act as though they’re independent from every other criminal organization, but the Gulf Cartel appears to be pulling the strings, under the leadership of Jorge Costilla “El Coss”—ever since “Tony Tormenta,” brother of Osiel Cárdenas, the former boss of the Gulf Cartel, was killed in a massive shootout with the Marines in Tamaulipas. So this alliance is who’s behind a new bloody offensive that’s targeting the Zetas’ state-wide protection network, particularly the metropolitan area, kinda like the Zetas’ version of Fortress Europe. I already talked about how effective these real-time human intelligence networks are. In spook circles, this sort of human intel is pure gold, just ask the C.I.A., they´d love to have something like this in every capital in the Middle East. Just as soon as 2011 started, Army soldiers on convoy patrol received a distress call from some state cops saying that they were being attacked and under fire from four heavily armed men in a black Jeep Patriot. Then the first executions of the year happened just outside a San Pedro Shopping center (called “Valle Oriente”), and over the following days there were more and more attacks on cops by heavily-armed criminals taking place in all the municipalities of the Metropolitan area. Cops in Monterrey, Apodaca, San Nicolas, Guadalupe and San Pedro were the main targets, but also cops from rural municipalities like General Teran, China, Los Herreras, and other little towns between the city of Monterrey and the state of Tamaulipas. The rural towns have become virtual ghost towns; the cops have all resigned out of fear, the ones that were not corrupt “polizetas” anyway…the other bastards are paid by the narcos to patrol and inform on military operations. Over the course of this month there´s been a steady increase of shootouts, dead cops, dead criminals, attacks against police stations and against the Topo Chico state prison. What this means is that the CDG (Cartel del Golfo, or in English, “The Gulf Cartel”) is engaging in all-out war on the Zetas’ security structure across four fronts. The first front is of course their attacks on cops; then they’re also executing huge numbers of “tienderos” (street drug dealers, the cannon fodder) and “halcones” (the spies who inform on military or suspicious activity). Everyone knows that every city’s municipal cops are just an extension of the Zetas–that’s why you don´t see people giving a fuck about these traitors when they’re being hunted down like game, the rare Mexican blue pig. The second front is inside the prison walls of the Topo Chico Penal Facility which the Zetas have under control because they’ve bought off the prison’s Administration. The prison mainly serves as a recruitment pool for Zeta foot-soldiers and the like, but it also serves as a massive safehouse, a place to hide when the heat is on. The CDG understands this so they are trying to wrestle control of the prison away from the Zetas. That’s why the kidnapping of “the Redhead” was just the beginning of a series of attacks that target the prison’s guards and the prisoners inside, sometimes by lobbing grenades from outside the walls into the big patios, where inmates and guards end up getting shrapnelled if they’re unlucky enough to be too close to the blast radius. The biggest strike so far came in December when “Don Gaby,” the piracy czar of this state, was killed by another inmate over a supposed money debt. “Don Gaby” was actually very important in the finance structure of the Zetas and linked to Heriberto Lazcano himself–he not only supplied all the piracy goods sold in the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Veracruz, but he also charged them a protection fee that amounted to $25 million pesos each month, or about $2 million US dollars. The Zetas used most of that money to buy more drug inventory (in huge quantities of course), as well as to buy weapons on the US border or to pay off local cops. The third front was launched inside of San Pedro, the stronghold plaza of the Beltran Leyvas in Nuevo Leon. The January 1st attack there was a bigtime message: it said that the Gulf Cartel could now attack them even inside San Pedro, and they expressed this message very clearly by shootings up San Pedro’s municipal cops. The shaky alliance between the Zetas and the Beltrán Leyvas appears to be finally breaking, especially now that the Beltran’s leader is dead and their main operators are in prison. Over the past few days there’ve been growing rumors that the Beltranes are breaking once and for all their alliance with the Zetas, and it may be true. Attacks in San Pedro have stopped suddenly—for some reason, they’re no longer being targeted in the same way that the Zetas are. The final front in this offensive is propaganda, with the now common usage of narco-messages that try convincing the population that they were fighting to restore peace and order to their lives–like modern-day Robin Hoods, if Robin Hood was a cokehead mass-murderer. One other strange thing was how someone hacked into the twitter account of “Telediario”, a local news show from the Multimedios Media Company. The hackers then uploaded a report that Governor Medina had been executed. It created an atmosphere of disbelief and fear, although more than anything, it created a lot of disappointment:  The execution of Gov. Medina would have been greeted as the best news this beleaguered region has gotten in a long time. Immediately after the bogus report, the hackers uploaded a direct threat against Multimedios: “Align or else.” Meaning, “Stop censoring Zeta-related news, you fucking sellouts!” So far the Gulf Cartel offensive has engulfed Monterrey in a brutal gang war were pretty much anything goes. It’s too early to declare a winner, but it looks like the Zetas’ protection from the cops is crumbling: The cops that still cooperate with them are getting ambushed every day by Gulf Cartel sicarios (assassins). But the Zetas are still strong enough to kill those cops who refuse to help them–so if there ever was a time to NOT be a cop in this city this is it. January is barely over and the body count already surpassed 100, making this the bloodiest, most violent month in the history of the state, and that´s counting the revolution and the dirty war of the 1960-70s. Good times. Another record is 20 cops dead in less than 30 days. Fuck me, Guinness should think about releasing a narco-only world records books because these bastards set the bar higher every day. Among the dead are the usual suspects: Cops, dealers, sicarios, etc. But there are a couple that stand out. First is Elín Jesús Ortíz Rosales, a 30 year-old native of the city of Saltillo (state of Coahuila) known in the Monterrey underworld as “Comandante Lino”. Lino is, or was, a Zeta commander identified by the Mexican Army as the Jefe de Plaza of the entire state of Nuevo Leon, in charge of the war against the Gulf cartel in the state. I don’t know how true this is, because a new leader is killed or captured here almost every month. If you’re looking for a quick promotion, join the Zetas now. Just don’t count on a long career. Lino died the most natural way a sicario can in this city: With a bullet to the head, assisted by the Mexican Army. The commander was driving through a rural back road between the municipalities of Escobedo and Monclova, accompanied by another man and a woman, most likely the girlfriend, when they ran into an Army truck on patrol. Naturally, when they see the army in their way, the sicarios try to escape. But once they realize they can´t, Commander Lino calls for reinforcements. At least 4 SUVs and a Mercedes sedan zoom up, join the fight and almost overwhelm the Mexican soldiers, who call for reinforcements of their own. It’s a cellphone vs. cellphone war. Once two more Army trucks join the fight, the Zetas drive off with the army in pursuit. Soon the pickup Lino was in flipped over and burned along with everyone inside. Six other Zeta sicarios died in multiple shootouts along the road. Several others escaped by hiding in the scrub or just outrunning the Army. More executions and the first narcoblockades of the year followed that action. Not that it matters anymore, but the loss could mean more trouble for the Zetas who have been continuously hit on various fronts non-stop, including more attacks against guards of the Topo Chico prison outside the city walls. The executions started in mid-December and hit the boiling point this past week when a woman who worked as a guard inside the prison was chopped to pieces and left in the street facing the prison doors. That wasn’t the only grim execution this month, with at least 7 to 8 more dismembered bodies found in Montemorelos, Nuevo Leon. One of these chunks of meat turned out to be a woman too. The Gulf Cartel was proud of the butcher job they did on these guys, because they carved “CDG” into arms and legs or whatever body part, and left a big note on top of the pile of bodies: “Sigue mandando Gente como esta pinche Mamito de Mierda Sigues tu Nico Guerra Luna ATTE: CDG Metro 32″ (“Keep sending your people, like this punk bitch. You’re next Nico Guerra Luna – CDG Metro 32″) Who knows who Nico Guerra Luna is, probably a cell leader or plaza leader of some importance, but “El Mamito” is Enrique Rejón, mexican soldier turned sicario extraordinaire. He was one of the original Zetas, the elite group of 34 soldiers who went into business for themselves. Now a trusted Lt. of Heriberto Lazcano. Last I heard of him he was in charge of the plaza of San Luis Potosi, a state to the south of Nuevo Leon and one of the poorest regions in Mexico. So it’s probably him and not “Comandante Lino” who is in charge of running the war operations against their former buddies from the gulf. Or maybe Lino is part of Miguel Treviño’s structure. There are many signs that point towards a fight for control within the zetas organization. Apparently a few months ago, Trevino, who’s known as “Z-40” by his fellow Zetas, called for a meeting with Lazcano in a ranch deep in the San Luis Potosi desert. There he planned to ambush Z-3 with help from the federal police and take control of the entire organization. And yes, apparently the Federal Police is allied with the zetas through a federal police official who happens to be a relative of Miguel Treviño, otherwise known as “Z-40.” Maybe in a follow up article I´ll get more into the links between Z-40 and the PFP, but it would take a long time to untangle who’s killing who. Hell, it´s confusing even to me sometimes. It’s also kinda depressing; feds allied with the Zetas? Fuck, talk about “a relationship that was meant to be.” Going back to their roots, I guess—back to a time when they still wore their uniforms when shooting people. The other VIP who met his doom this past week was a cattle businessman named Arturo de la Garza, son of a PRI state Governor. The “Cattle Baron,” as the US media calls him, was kidnapped. You can guess what happened after that: They found his body on a road in Nuevo Leon. What I found interesting about this particular murder is that even though the executioners scrawled a message on the “Cattle Baron”’s body, none of the local newspapers printed that message. But they made sure to get the idea across anyway, thanks to a photo on the front page: “This will happen to whoever supports the Z.” Signed, CDG. Although the rumor is that the Zetas are the ones that killed him to send a message to the PRI (the longtime Mexico ruling political party) in the state. People who believe that rumor are also saying that the next politician to die will be the PRI mayor of Guadalupe, Ivonne Alvarez. But then again this could be a narco-business tactic designed to move into a rival’s market. This tactic works this way: the more heat you bring on the state, the more the state beefs up its military presence. Mass-killing of innocent bystanders is a pretty high-impact tactical crime that the cartels use to trigger a big military presence and disrupt the operations of the rival cartel in the plaza. It’s all off the record of course: this is just one of those things that everybody around here knows or suspects, but it hasn’t been officially talked about much because it’s just too depressing. It’s kind of clever, in a bloody way: you send somebody to your rivals’ hometown to shoot up civilians. The Feds descend on the place and search everything, shut down business. For the price of a few bullets, you disrupt the competition’s whole operation. Nothing personal, strictly business. One sign that it might be working is that the Zetas are hard up for cash, to the point they’ve started robbing restaurants and casinos. That’s just about unheard-of for major drug dealers. When a drug dealer needs to do armed robberies to get their cash flow up, you know something’s wrong with their drug-cartel business. LATE NARCO-WAR PORN UPDATE: Just as I sent this story in, another 6 bodies, almost completely burned, were found in the municipality of Escobedo, Nuevo Leon. And 1 more dead body was discovered in Cadereyta, with multiple gunshot wounds to the head and extremities. Over in San Nicolas, city hall has imposed a nighttime curfew on all of its police agents, who are barred from leaving their assigned police stations after 7 PM because of the lack of security. They can only leave their police stations in the case of an emergency or to direct traffic if needed. It’s in response to the two transit cops who were killed yesterday—that’s scaring the shit out of every cop in the greater metropolitan area, not just San Nicolas cops, but everywhere now, state and municipal cops are even asking the Army to accompany them in the newly installed checkpoint—oops, I meant to say “security filters” which is the official term they’re using. (“Military checkpoint” doesn´t have a very comforting, nice ring to it, according to the local politicians anyway.) The number of these militarized checkpoints in my hometown of Monterrey has grown substantially in the last couple of weeks, from 28 to 43. They’re officially there to look for stolen vehicles and to check the flow of armed passengers—which is to say, they’re looking for narcos, or trying to make things a bit tougher on their movements. See, this is why it´s so fucking difficult writing about the drug war. So many corpses to keep count of, so many names, so much shit all around. *** Pancho Montana is the eXiled Online’s Special Mexican War on Drugs Correspondent.

My father’s side of my family actually knows the father of the “Peliroja”. The police where shitting their pants since the last week of December ever since “La Nueva Federacion” made their announcement. I predicted that the campaign agaisnt cops would severely erode the support for the Zetas and it looks like it has. Also you should look in doing a translation of La Nueva Federacion’s announcement. 7.

Here in the US, we’re hearing about how the ATF is ‘walking’ guns across the border into Mexico, as per instructions from ‘higher up’ in the US Govt. And it’s assult type weapons. Are you aware of the Z’s or CDG’s using US made weapons ? And if so, which cartels are using US weapons could give a clue as to where the NEOCONs/NWO are trying to control the Mexican Drug Trade in terms of their plans to control the world. 9. H.

Calvin  |  February 2nd, 2011 at 1:27 pm After reading this article, I certainly have more respect for the migrants who cross the U.S. border and work at demeaning but honest jobs for Americans, rather than take up a gun for the cartels. That photo of the dismembered bodies will haunt me for weeks. But one major thing I don’t understand: The brutality and violence of the cartels cannot be news to any Mexican, so why did Mexican society tolerate the cartels, police corruption and the PRI for so long? Were the opposition politicians so lame and out-of-touch that they couldn’t make that a campaign issue and sweep into power? Maybe my big bad government is tied to it, but I’d like to hear some other reasons and opinions. 12. Hannibal  |  February 2nd, 2011 at 2:55 pm @Calvino– Just read the ‘Mexican Drug War’ page on Wikipedia; it lays it out. Basically, “security analysts in Mexico City trace the origins of the rising scourge to the unraveling of a longtime implicit arrangement between narcotics traffickers and governments controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which lost its grip on political power starting in the late 1980s.” There was violence back then, but it wasn’t like today, and there was no internet, so we didn’t really know every excruciating detail. The elections in the 90′s were clos(er), but it would have been dumb to make drug trafficking the platform for a presidential run. Calderon has staked his presidency on fighting the cartels, but I think he wishes he would have focused on alleviating poverty, feeding the children, gay rights, anything but precipitate the raging war he now has in his hands. The US was involved insofar as they let the PRI do what the wanted, provided they kept the lid on Mexico’s troubles and kept the masses at bay. Kind of similar to Egypt, where the US supports a dictator because he’s easier to deal with than a full-fledged democracy, where certain interests might want to, try to get a cut of the political and economic action. 13. Liz2000  |  February 2nd, 2011 at 3:21 pm Bomb Mexico! That’s my solution! 14. Pascual Gorostieta  |  February 2nd, 2011 at 3:26 pm The US was quite complicit in helping the rise of the Guadalajara Cartel in the 60s as well. 15. Havs  |  February 3rd, 2011 at 8:45 am Suggestion: Some of the images in the article are deeply disturbing. I would advise linking to them on a separate page or putting some javascript mumbo-jumbo to hide the content until the mouse passess on it (putting instead of the image a warning about it’s nature when mouse is not over). 16. Awesome  |  February 3rd, 2011 at 11:17 pm Also, translation fix: (”Keep sending your people, like this punk bitch. You’re next Nico Guerra Luna – CDG Metro 32″) Should be “like this big pile of shit” instead of “like this punk bitch” 17. pMX?  |  February 4th, 2011 at 12:27 pm Or “fucking Mamito piece of shit” would be more accurate. 18. nada nada  |  February 5th, 2011 at 8:50 pm En un pais pobre siempre va a ver corrupcion porque cualquier persona aria lo que sea para salir de la pobresa o darles comida a sus hijos.

Aleajandro  |  March 27th, 2011 at 3:50 pm You knowwhat my opinion is? my opinion is that if your a fucking american, you should keep your mouth glued shut about “This War” because all you do is spread lies, bullshit, sensationalism and propaganda that aids the drug cartels. But of course, maybe thatisyour purpose, you feed ignorance into an already extremely ignorant and arrogant nation, that nation is the USA. and americans eat this bullshit like apple pie. I Travel to Mexico twice every month of every year, and let me tell you NOT ONCE, have I seen a dead body, heard a shootout, been extorted or kidnapped. everything you are saying is a lie. STOP DAMAGING THE IMAGE OF MY NATION. If you are NOT MEXICAN, you have no privalege to report on MEXICAN AFFAIR. maybe I should report on those +60,000 deaths that have ocurred in the USA since 2006. 23. Jose  |  April 9th, 2011 at 4:34 am @Aleajandro. This is DEFINITELY no lie. I’m very fortunate to not have to go through that on a daily basis because I was born and live in the united states, but I have a cousin that lives in Monterrey. And from the things she’s told me and shown me , this is a very real threat. To live in constant fear is not something to be taken lightly,the simple act of driving to work can get you killed by either a stray bullet or straight up being executed or kidnapped and ransomed if it’s discovered that you have ties or family in the united states. 24. D  |  April 14th, 2011 at 9:38 am I work as a private contractor for a private military company located near San Diego. I can tell ALL OF YOU that, although i am not Mexican, I can speak of affairs in the nation….From 10+years of experience of counternarco/interdiction operations in the Southern and SouthWestern regions of Baja and Mexico, I can tell you the threat is not some exaggerated “lie” that the US created or fed into. In fact, if anything, there are more stories that miss getting printed than the ones that do see print. I have seen the piles of bodies firsthand. Its as bad as you imagine, but what the pics dont show you is the smell….I won’t ever forget it. If people only knew that we (the US) can combat this very easily. We aren’t as corrupt or as inefficient in dealing with mobile threats like the Zetas. They are not as well trained the people i work with(even if the Zetas/sicarios are former military) and they aren’t impossible to track. The problem is Mexico’s inability to CLEAN HOUSE. They need to re-work their justice system completely. Thats the first step…The next step is bringing in some private military contractors who don’t have to follow the rules (or Geneva convention) and let us handle it. We’d love to help. How about you just call us in, take off our leash, close your eyes and plug your ears, and we’ll take care of it…Easy 25. greetingsFromSaferPlace  |  September 27th, 2011 at 12:05 pm I wish you bon courage and take care with this site. I am afraid those cartels have also hackers etc in their ranks, last time I opened video about history of Zetas to be immediately attacked by some virus. Maybe coincidence, maybe not. 26. Rick Pettis  |  October 24th, 2011 at 12:04 pm Aleajandro, Don’t like our country? Then go back to that piece of shit country you call home,Mexico and make things better! You and a million others are here for a better life, right? So shut up or go home! Zetas, Gulf Cartel, and others are in the U.S. conducting their business. Ask residents of Texas or Arizona if we need to secure our borders. It’s so sad to see so many people living in fear and when they try to leave the cartel’s are the ones “helping” them get out of Mexico so..they extort, rape, kill and put in to slavery thousands of illegals a day!!! the nightmare doesn’t end for these people in Mexico! 27. tu padre  |  January 13th, 2012 at 1:50 pm if the US would keep the f,,,king guns in the US it could change everything, but the US is even involved in all the guns trafficking into Mexico, so stop playing to be perfect, pinchis bolillos 28. Glarmer  |  February 2nd, 2012 at 5:50 am Nobody cares really about these Mexican drug dealers except for Mexicans. Mexico needs to get it’s ethics together collectively and return to a stable path. It cannot have these thought impaired idiots running around playing like they’re in the movies and destroying lives and the perception of Mexico. In the end, the drug dealers only hurt the greater country and themselves. We really don’t care if they all get killed and most people would support a military intrusion and summary execution of every single one of them. Quite frankly, that’s just how it is from the outside looking in. 29. Ernesto  |  February 7th, 2012 at 6:49 pm I have been researching the US/Mexico Border now for some time as it relates to my University coursework. I have been watching, reading, and listening to comments from all sides. There is an answer to this madness, but the bottom line is the cartels have over ran the Mexican government. Anyone tries to impliment policy to fight the cartels and the turn up missing. They have a lot of money backing them from Comubia, Central and South America. The Mexican Mafia, Motor Cycle Gangs, and others are moving the dope once it gets to the US Border. This is a transnational business. It is not about the Mexican Government turning over for a bribe, It is about take our deal or die. Something needs to be done, but what? 30. susan  |  May 14th, 2012 at 12:40 pm Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One (God) who can destroy both soul and body in hell.Matthew 10:28 31. goodmen  |  June 19th, 2012 at 11:23 am people must exit homes and kill all narko biatches. all related stuff too.

Usually it’s triggered by the passion displayed in the post I read. And on this article Mexicos Narco-War 2011: The Gulf Cartel Chops Up the Zetas – By Pancho Montana – The eXiled. I was excited enough to drop a commenta response I actually do have a couple of questions for you if you tend not to mind. Is it just me or does it look as if like some of the responses come across like they are left by brain dead folks? And, if you are writing at other online social sites, I would like to follow you.
