King Abdullah of Jordan has dismissed his cabinet and appointed a new prime minister amid large street protests. New PM Marouf Bakhit has been charged with carrying out "true political reforms", but the Islamist opposition rejected the appointment. The protesters had demanded action on unemployment and rising prices and the right to elect the prime minister. They blamed former PM Samir Rifai for the country's economic problems and had called on him to stand down. The palace said the king had accepted Mr Rifai's resignation earlier on Tuesday. The move is being seen as an attempt to head off further trouble from angry Jordanians, in the wake of the unrest in Tunisia and Egypt. In a statement, the palace said the new prime minister's mission was "to take practical, quick and tangible steps to launch true political reforms, enhance Jordan's democratic drive and ensure safe and decent living for all Jordanians". Reform was a "necessity to provide a better life for our people, but we won't be able to attain that without real political reforms, which must increase popular participation in the decision-making", it said. 'History of corruption' Mr Bakhit, a retired army major-general, served as Jordan's prime minister from 2005 until his resignation in 2007. Before then he served as the kingdom's national security adviser and its ambassador to Israel. Continue reading the main story “Start Quote Critics point out that Mr Bakhit did not achieve many of the reforms he promised during his last tenure and they wonder what he will accomplish this time around.” End Quote Dale Gavlak BBC News, Amman New PM unlikely to appease protesters He was also the head of a state committee that oversaw the implementation of the peace treaty that Jordan signed with Israel in 1994, and served as ambassador to Turkey for three years. He has a doctorate in political science and taught the subject at a university for army and police recruits in southern Jordan. The country's powerful Islamist opposition movement, the Islamic Action Front (IAF), said it did not welcome Mr Bakhit's appointment. "With the choice of Bakhit, it's obvious that reforms have not started yet. We are against Bakhit because our experience with him is not encouraging," IAF head Hamzah Mansur told the AFP news agency. "There is no reason to stop the protests now," he said. The IAF has always said it believed elections in 2007, after which Mr Bakhit stood down, were rigged. "He carried out the worst parliamentary elections in Jordan in 2007," said Zaki Bani Rsheid, another IAF leader. "He is not the right person to run things at this current state and get Jordan out of crisis," he said. "We need a man who is well respected by the people, a man who does not have a history of corruption and oppression. How can he lead political reform?" Mr Mansur said the appointment of Mr Bakhit was no reason to end the protests The IAF has said repeatedly it is not seeking to oust King Abdullah, who has the power to appoint governments, approve legislation and dissolve parliament. Jordan has a high unemployment rate among its population of six million, the majority of whom are under 25, and is suffering from the rising food and fuel prices which have affected many of its neighbours. The country has seen three weeks of largely peaceful protests, inspired by those in Tunisia which unseated President Zine al-Abedine Ben Ali and the ongoing unrest in Egypt. The government recently announced a $125m (£78m) package to reduce prices, as well as measures to boost salaries, in an attempt to ease the protests. But many of those on the streets said the measures were not enough and have demanded more extensive political reforms, including the right to directly elect the prime minister.

King Abdullah II of Jordan pledged to embark on an immediate programme of democratic reform  Photo: AP By Adrian Blomfield, Middle East Correspondent 5:40PM GMT 01 Feb 2011 The king became the first Arab leader to announce political concessions from a position of relative security as he sought to pre-empt opposition-led demonstrations inspired by Egypt's attempted revolution against President Hosni Mubarak. He followed up the dismissal of Samir Rifai, his popular prime minister, and the entire cabinet, with a pledge to embark on an immediate programme of democratic reform. But the king's choice of Marouf Bakhit, widely seen as a conservative resistant to reform, as Mr Rifai's successor immediately drew more criticism than praise. A former general, Mr Bakhit was accused of failing to deliver on a promised liberalisation agenda during his previous term as prime minister in 2005-2007. "This is not a step in the right direction and does not show any intent towards real political reforms," said Sheikh Hamza Mansour, leader of the Islamic Action Front, Jordan's largest opposition group. Related Articles Jordan: poverty, unemployment and lack of freedoms 01 Feb 2011 Jordan: the desert kingdom that has played a pivotal role in the Middle East 01 Feb 2011 Jordan: revolution fears in Algeria, Yemen and Syria 01 Feb 2011 Protests led by a coalition of Islamists, secular opposition groups and retired army generals have brought thousands onto the streets of Amman, the capital city, and other parts of the country. Although far smaller than the demonstrations in Egypt and Tunisia, they have caused considerable disquiet even though none of the protesters have demanded the abdication of Abdullah, who assumed the throne in 1999. Instead, they demanded the dismissal of Mr Rifai's government and a change in electoral law to allow the Jordanian people to vote for their prime minister, a position presently selected by royal appointment. They also called for the dissolution of parliament, elected in a general election last November that was widely seen as heavily flawed. Royal aides said the king has instructed his new government to reform the unpopular electoral law and insisted that he had met most of the protesters' demands by paving the way for Jordan's transformation from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy. "The king has been urging reforms for a while," Ayman Safadi, the outgoing deputy prime minister and a leading royal adviser, told The Daily Telegraph. "His Majesty is not a politician. He is doing what he thinks is right for Jordan, which is to institute gradual but tangible reform." Leaders of the protests insist that their respect for Abdullah, whose Hashemite dynasty was granted rule over Jordan by Britain after the First World War, remains undimmed. Like in other Arab states that have been swept by unrest, Jordanians complain of rising prices, widespread unemployment and a low standard of living. So far at least, their anger has been directed at Jordan's politicians, who are viewed as corrupt, undemocratic and unaccountable. But observers warn that a failure to address such discontent could ultimately threaten the survival of the monarchy. Like Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, King Abdullah is considered a vital US ally even if his kingdom lacks the economic and energy clout of many of its neighbours. Following Egypt's lead, Jordan became the only other Arab state to sign a peace deal with Israel and the king is regarded as an important moderate voice in the Middle East. Israeli officials have privately expressed concern that a power vacuum in Jordan, which has considerable uranium reserves, could lead to the rise of the Islamic Action Front, an offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood that is hostile to Israel.   Jordan News » World News » Middle East » Adrian Blomfield » In Jordan   The Pope in Palestine   Zaatari Refugee camp   Middle East royal tour   Winter storms hit the Middle East   An ice cold bath   Read more World News Previously uncontacted Peruvian Indians 'could carry flu back to tribe'   Activists fear that virus contracted by Amazonian tribe members fleeing violent attacks could spread through vulnerable and isolated communities Islamic State uses high grade captured weapons to fight Assad troops in Syria   The extremist group is benefiting from huge caches of arms it seized after overrunning parts of Northern Iraq Wikipedia bans editing of its pages by Congressional staffers after ‘online vandalism’   The internet encyclopaedia announces ban in response to “persistent disruptive editing” – such as describing Donald Rumsfeld as a “alien lizard” – by anonymous users in House of Representatives Nigeria confirms Liberian man died of Ebola in Lagos   Ebola caused the death of a Liberian national who died in quarantine in Lagos, Nigeria confirms Benedict Cumberbatch greets Comic-Con fans   Video Benedict Cumberbatch to Megan Fox meet fans and promote their latest films Penguins of Madagascar and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the massive pop culture expo Comic-Con, in San Diego Young woman allegedly posts picture using mascara looted from crash site   Yekaterina Parkhomenko uploaded a photograph with the caption: 'Mascara from Amsterdam; to be precise, from the field.

The dismissal follows several protests calling for change in Jordan -- protests that echo demonstrations that have swept across North Africa and the Middle East in the last few weeks. King Abdullah II asked Marouf Al Bakhit to form a government in Jordan that will implement "genuine political reform," the Royal Court said in a statement. The government will "take practical steps, quick and concrete, to launch a process of genuine political reform" and "comprehensive development," according to a letter from the king to Al Bakhit. It also will act to strengthen democracy, the letter said. Jordan has been deprived of "achievement opportunities" due to some leaders' resistance to change, the king wrote, and because they had sometimes put their own interests ahead of those of the public. The king asked Al Bakhit and the new government "to conduct a thorough evaluation process" and review laws regarding political affairs and civil freedoms to "address the mistakes of the past" and develop "a clear action plan that takes the march of reform forward." Will unrest spread to other countries? Jordan's king orders reform RELATED TOPICS Amman (Jordan) King Abdullah II also called on the new government to strengthen the institutional infrastructure and combat corruption, and prosecute those found to be involved in corruption. Jawad Anani, a former Jordanian deputy prime minister, told CNN the changes had to be made and that the development comes amid a "deep outcry in the Arab world" seeking change and reform. He said the king wants Jordan to be more competitive, globalized, and influential, but the management he's been choosing "has not been very successful." "That's why there's been many changes in government," Anani said. In this case, the message of reform, he said, covers the political, social, economic, and educational arenas. "This is a very tall order at this time," Anani said. But, he said, the king has "kick-started a process" for all Jordanian citizens "to join in and make their opinions heard." The development in Jordan follows protests that forced the president of Tunisia from power and unrest that has convulsed Egypt for days. Demonstrators also have called for change in Algeria, Sudan and Yemen. Protest organizers have called for a demonstration this week in Syria. In Jordan, police estimated that several thousand people gathered in the capital Friday to demand more significant economic and political reforms. Protesters including Islamists, leftists and union members marched in downtown Amman, and there were protests in six other cities as well, authorities said. It was the third Friday in a row for the protests. Demonstrators gathered in front of the Al Husseini Mosque to decry government policies they blamed for rising prices, low wages and unemployment. The demonstrators had demanded what the king did Tuesday -- sack Prime Minister Samir Rifai, who took office in December 2009. They also called for the dissolution of parliament. The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, is also asking for an "elected government." Currently, the king appoints the prime minister and the Cabinet. The Jordanian government in recent weeks announced several measures aimed at easing citizens' economic hardships, including reducing taxes on fuel derivatives and subsidizing some basic commodities. A pay raise of 20 Jordanian dinars a month (US$28) was given to civil servants, military personnel and retirees. But protesters Friday said the measures do not go far enough. Those in Amman Friday also showed their solidarity with others in the Arab world, most notably Egypt, where protesters have recently taken to the streets to demand certain freedoms and urge the ouster of their leaders and the government.

Jordan's Royal Palace announced that the Monarchy had accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Samir Rifai, who many blame for rising fuel and food prices and poor economic performance. The King has asked ex-army general Marouf Bakhit to form a new government. Bakhit has been prime minister before and also has been an ambassador to Israel so while this change may be prompted by the demands of the people in the streets, it is not seen as any real change in the status quo. The Jerusalem Post had this to say about him: n 2005, Abdullah named Bakhit as his prime minister days after a triple bombing on Amman hotels claimed by the al-Qaida in Iraq leader, Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. During his 2005-2007 tenure, Bakhit — an ex-army major general and top intelligence adviser — was credited with maintaining security and stability following the attack. According to Rosemary Hollis, professor of Middle East policy studies at London's City University, [Bakhit] is a former general and briefly ambassador to Israel who has been prime minister before. He's someone who would be seen as a safe pair of hands, I wouldn't see it as a sign of liberalization. With his previous premiership, he talked the talk of reform but little actually happened. Inspired by events in Tunisia and Egypt, protests have spread across Jordan in recent weeks. Demonstrators blame corruption and free-market reforms for making the plight of the poor worst than it already was. Jordan has one of the Arab worlds smallest economies and it is heavily dependent on foreign aid. The King's succession of governments have done nothing to stem a prolonged recession or the rising public debt that has grown to a record $15bn this year. Every Friday since the fall of Ben Ali in Tunisia, the opposition movement has held protest rallies in Amman, Jordan's capital, following Muslim pray. This Friday, About 3,500 opposition activists from Jordan's main Islamist opposition group, trade unions and leftist organizations gathered in Amman's downtown, waving colorful banners reading: "Send the corrupt guys to court." The crowd denounced Jordanian Prime Minister Samir Rifai's unpopular policies. Many shouted: "Rifai go away, prices are on fire and so are the Jordanians." Another 2,500 people also took to the streets in six other cities across the country after the noon prayers. Those protests also called for Rifai's ouster. King Abdullah has promised to have Bakhit "correct the mistakes of the past." The King also said that economic reform was a "necessity to provide a better life for our people, but we won't be able to attain that without real political reforms, which must increase popular participation in the decision-making." Regardless of such talk of reform and enlightenment and in spite of changes at the top, the protests in Jordan are expected to grow as this movement for radical change sweeps the region.
