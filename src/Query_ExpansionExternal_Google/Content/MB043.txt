Dennis Kucinich said Friday that he settled a lawsuit filed against a Capitol Hill cafeteria over a split tooth he says he suffered when he bit into an olive pit in a sandwich wrap. The lawsuit filed in early January in Washington had sought $150,000 in damages from companies involved with the Longworth House Office Building cafeteria. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount that reflected out-of-pocket costs, according to the parties involved. The Ohio congressman said biting into the pit in April 2008 split a tooth down to the bone, caused excruciating pain and required reconfigured bridgework. The damaged tooth became infected, and he suffered a reaction to an antibiotic and an intestinal obstruction that required emergency medical attention, Kucinich said. The initial dental implant to replace the split tooth failed and required a second attempt, he said. None of the dental expenses were covered by insurance, he said. Kucinich, a liberal who made an unsuccessful bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, said he was satisfied with the legal outcome. "I feel that the defendants have responded fairly and reasonably," he said in a statement. "I don't want to have to make another dental visit for a very long time." One company named in the lawsuit, Compass Group USA Inc., declined to release settlement terms. "The parties have exchanged information and, after some investigation and discussion, have resolved the matter for an amount all parties believe reflects the actual out-of-pocket expenses related to this incident," the company said in a statement. A second company named in the lawsuit, Performance Food Group Co., didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kucinich claims he hurt his tooth by biting into an olive pit that was part of his vegetarian sandwich, and now he wants to settle this in the courts. Ughh! There is so much wrong with this lawsuit that I hardly know where to begin, but here are some of the reasons why Americans should care about this. As taxpayers, we all pay for premium dental coverage for Kucinich and all members of Congress. Surely, it has to be some of the best dental care in the world. Has the congressman opted out of this coverage? Or, does he still have the coverage and want to reimburse taxpayers for the cost of his dental care? We don’t know because Kucinich’s attorney has stated that this is a “private matter.” Neither he nor Kucinich will comment. Well, when you’re a member of the United States House of Representatives and file a lawsuit like this, it’s not going to remain a private matter. It shouldn’t be a private matter. There are a lot of reasons why Americans deserve to know more and why we should be disturbed by this lawsuit. Even if the congressman wants to seek reimbursement for the cost of his dental work to save taxpayers from having to foot the bill for this, there are better ways to accomplish that. Let’s say for argument’s sake that the cafeteria was somehow responsible. Did he try talking with them about some sort of settlement before suing? If that didn’t work, did he try low-cost facilitative mediation (which is much different from court-ordered mediation)? I suspect he didn’t offer to take this to mediation in an effort to save the cafeteria or the food suppliers he also sued from the aggravation and expense of having to hire a lawyer to defend themselves. If he had, that would make him look at least somewhat sympathetic to America’s struggling job providers who must deal with frivolous lawsuits on a regular basis, and he would probably be declaring that from the rooftop of Congress. At least one lawyer has said that the pit in the sandwich was foreseeable and therefore is not grounds for a lawsuit. I agree, but of course, this is what lawyers argue about and is the legal theory on which Kucinich will hang his hat. There’s a larger point to be made here, however. There used to be a time when lawsuits over minor injuries were filed only as a last resort. Not anymore, and that’s part of the problem in our country. It’s a major reason why every American pays a “lawsuit tax” of nearly $2,000 per year — even if we’re never sued. Many of us have bitten into food, hurt a tooth, and chosen NOT to sue. These things happen. It’s part of life. You get the tooth fixed and move on — especially if you have dental coverage. If you don’t have coverage, there are options like mediation if you really must push the issue. And even if you’re going to push it, how do you arrive at damages worth $150,000? Really? As the creator of the annual Wacky Warning Label Contest, one of the first things I did after hearing about this lawsuit was check the label on the jar of pitted olives in my refrigerator. These olives have big red pimentos in them where the pit used to be. Do you think there’s a warning? Of course there is. It says: “May contain pits.” I wish obvious warnings like that weren’t necessary in the United States, but lawsuits like the one filed by Congressman Kucinich unfortunately show us why they are. Bob Dorigo Jones, who serves as Senior Fellow for the Center for America, is the author of the bestselling Remove Child Before Folding, The 101 Stupidest, Silliest and Wackiest Warning Labels Ever. He is the host of a new national radio/Internet commentary, “Let’s Be Fair.” Tags: Congress, Dennis Kucinich, Food and drink     Share ?

Kucinich's complaint (pdf) A man bites into a sandwich wrap and his tooth splits in half, below the crown and to the bone. An unpitted olive did the damage. The tooth becomes infected; the man has an adverse reaction to his antibiotics, and emergency medical intervention is ordered. Six replacement teeth later, the man sues the sandwich maker for $150,000 in pain, suffering and "loss of enjoyment" - the American way. Here's the twist: the man is the most famous vegan on Capitol Hill, two-time presidential candidate Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio). And the sandwich maker is the basement cafeteria of the Longworth House Office Building. Kucinich's three-year journey to the olive pit-oral surgery abyss and back ended Friday afternoon with one of the more bizarre letters to campaign supporters in modern American politics. The subject line: "Regarding Settlement of Dental Injury Law Suit." Kucinich wrote that after filing a lawsuit this month over the April 2008 incident, he had settled with the cafeteria operator, Restaurant Associates, for the out-of-pocket expenses of his surgeries (there were three). He said the terms are confidential. That's about the only part of this story that the 64-year-old congressman and onetime Cleveland mayor kept confidential. "When I bit into the olive pit, [unbeknown to me at the time], upon impact the tooth split in half, vertically through the crown and the tooth, below the level of the bone," Kucinich wrote in his e-mail to supporters. "Externally there was no evidence of a break. This was not about aesthetics. The internal structure of the tooth was rendered nonrestorable. Although the pain was excruciating, I shook it off and I went right back to work. "This tooth is a key tooth which anchored my upper bridgework. The injured tooth and the bone above it became infected. I took a course of antibiotics for the infection, had an adverse reaction to the antibiotics which caused me to have an intestinal obstruction and emergency medical intervention." Kucinich kept going: "Later, my dentist referred me to a specialist who informed me that the damaged tooth had to be removed. A third dentist removed the tooth and I was fitted for a temporary partial. I waited for the bone to heal." And going: "An implant was placed, but it failed. Many months later still a second implant succeeded. My bridgework had to be completely reconfigured, a new partial was designed, so this injury did not affect only one tooth, but rather involved six (6) replacement teeth as well. A new crown with a new precision attachment was engineered and put in place." And going: "To clarify, no dental expenses were covered by any health plan, nor did I have dental insurance that covered the injury, which, until it was resolved, affected my ability to chew food properly." Kucinich - whom his official Web site refers to as "America's Most Courageous Congressman" - ended his 534-word diary entry to supporters not with a plea for campaign donations but with a simple quip. "I don't want to have to make another dental visit for a very long time," he wrote, "and will be making no further comment on this matter. "Thank you very much," he signed it. "Dennis." » This Story: Read + | Comments More in the Politics Section 2008 Fundraising See who is giving to the '08 presidential candidates. Research Donations ...

Dennis Kucinich's olive pit lawsuit Print Sabrina Eaton, Plain Dealer Washington Reporter By Sabrina Eaton, Plain Dealer Washington Reporter The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on January 27, 2011 at 7:30 PM, updated January 28, 2011 at 9:09 AM View/Post Comments Associated PressRep. Dennis Kucinich The world is eating up the story of Rep. Dennis Kucinich's $150,000 lawsuit against a congressional cafeteria that sold him a sandwich wrap containing an olive pit. The case Kucinich filed earlier this month is leaving a bad taste in people's mouths as it makes the rounds of newspapers and blogs throughout the English speaking world. On Wednesday night, CNN host Anderson Cooper put Kucinich on his "RidicuList." Click here to see the CNN video. "You know what makes the price of food skyrocket?" Cooper said. "Suing a cafeteria for $150,000 for making you a sandwich." The Plain Dealer's initial story on the former Democratic presidential candidate's lawsuit had 190,000 hits on the cleveland.com website by Thursday afternoon, making it 2011's most popular story. Versions of Kucinich's dental misadventure ran on newspaper websites in England, Canada and India, as well as in major U.S. outlets like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and Time magazine. After reading through the District of Columbia Superior Court filing in which Kucinich says the sandwich, which he bought in 2008, "contained dangerous substances, namely an olive pit," many opined that Kucinich's lawsuit was the pits. "Said sandwich wrap was unwholesome and unfit for human consumption, in that it was represented to contain pitted olives, yet unknown to plaintiff contained an unpitted olive or olives," said Kucinich's lawsuit. "As a direct and proximate result of defendant's aforesaid negligence, plaintiff has suffered serious and permanent injuries for which he is entitled to recover damages, including but not limited to past and future dental and medical expenses, compensation for pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment and other damages." On Thursday morning, nationally syndicated radio host Don Imus called Kucinich "a creep" after executive producer Bernard McGuirk described the legal filing. Imus was called worse things himself several years ago after he leveled racist, sexist insults at the Rutgers University women's basketball team. On Thursday's edition of ABC's "Good Morning America," reporter Jonathan Karl extended an olive branch to the cafeteria in the House of Representatives' Longworth office building by complimenting its food before he described Kucinich's allegations. Click here to see the Good Morning America segment, which included a cartoon version of Kucinich chomping on a vegeterian wrap and having several teeth go black. "His own website calls him 'America's Most Courageous Congressman,' but apparently he was no match for a sandwich wrap bought at this cafeteria on Capitol Hill," Karl said. Host George Stephanopoulos quipped that it's strange that Kucinich, who "has not been shy to speak out to the media in the past," is refusing to discuss the lawsuit beyond what's in his legal filing. "It's almost as if he's embarrassed by all this," said Stephanopoulos. "Getting turned down for an interview request from Dennis Kucinich is one of the rarer things to happen on Capitol Hill, so I expect eventually he'll talk about this," Karl replied.

Dennis Kucinich sues cafeteria over olive pit in sandwich Print Sabrina Eaton, Plain Dealer Washington Reporter By Sabrina Eaton, Plain Dealer Washington Reporter The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on January 26, 2011 at 12:51 PM, updated January 27, 2011 at 12:22 PM View/Post Comments The Plain Dealer Dennis Kucinich WASHINGTON, D.C. - Rep. Dennis Kucinich has rapped a U.S. House of Representatives cafeteria with a $150,000 lawsuit for selling him a vegetarian sandwich wrap in 2008 that he says caused dental damage when he bit into an olive pit. The lawsuit that the Cleveland Democrat filed Jan. 3 against operators and suppliers of the Longworth House Office Building cafeteria says the sandwich he bought there "on or about" April 17, 2008 "contained dangerous substances, namely an olive pit, that a consumer would not reasonably expect to find in the final product served." Biting into it caused serious "permanent dental and oral injuries requiring multiple surgical and dental procedures," the legal documents say. They contend the congressman is entitled to damages for future dental and medical expenses and to compensate him for pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment. "Said sandwich wrap was unwholesome and unfit for human consumption in that it was presented to contain pitted olives, yet unknown to plaintiff, contained an unpitted olive or olives which plaintiff did not reasonably expect to be in the food prepared for him, and could not visually detect prior to consumption," the lawsuit said. A scheduling conference on the case has been set for April 8 before District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Gregory E. Jackson. Kucinich's mishap occurred several months after the vegan congressman abandoned his second ill-fated presidential run. On the day of the incident, Kucinich chaired a hearing that examined whether cattle were being abused in California slaughterhouses. The dental damage didn't keep Kucinich from speaking out for long. On April 24, he appeared on Fox News Channel to discuss rising fuel prices with Neil Cavuto, transcripts show. Kucinich's congressional office referred questions on the case to his attorney, Andrew R. Young, who declined to comment further on the suit or on the extent of Kucinich's injuries. "It truly is a private matter," said Young, a former aide to Kucinich who has also served as a North Ridgeville council member. A spokeswoman for the North Carolina-based restaurant company that operates the cafeteria, Compass Group, confirmed it has received the lawsuit and is reviewing the matter. "Beyond that we don't comment on pending litigation," Compass Group Vice President Cheryl Queen said in an e-mail. Kucinich's lawsuit also names a pair of food suppliers to the cafeteria as defendants. Julie Botset of Performance Food Group said her company "will not comment on litigation or offer any comments on this case." Spokesmen for the other food supplier, Foodbuy LLC, did not respond to a request Wednesday for comment.

'+'\x3C/scr'+'ipt>'); })(); DAILY NEWS New York News Politics Sports Entertainment Opinion Living Autos Search Rep. Dennis Kucinich settles olive pit sandwich lawsuit; apologizes to constituents for distraction BY Nina Mandell DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Friday, January 28, 2011, 6:48 PM A A A Honda/Getty Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich said he was in excruciating pain after biting into an olive pit. Former Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich's bad lunch just got a little easier to swallow. The Democrat Congressman settled a suit against a Capitol Hill cafeteria that he filed after he damaged his tooth biting down on an olive pit in a sandwich wrap in 2008. The Ohio congressman claimed when he bit into the olive-pit-ful sandwich, a sad run of woes began. He split a tooth down to the bone, which required extensive dentist work. Even worse – the tooth became infected, Kucinich complained, and he suffered a reaction to an antibiotic. Finally, he had an intestinal obstruction that required emergency medical attention. "Although the pain was excruciating, I shook it off and I went right back to work," he wrote in a letter to supporters. On Friday, the two sides settled for an undisclosed amount, that was supposed to reflect the out-of-pocket damages Kucinich had to pay for his woes. "I feel that the defendants have responded fairly and reasonably," he said in a statement. "I don't want to have to make another dental visit for a very long time." In the letter to supporters, Kucinich apologized for the distractions from issues not involving sandwiches, but explained the lawsuit wasn't frivolous. "This injury required nearly two years, three dental surgeries, and a substantial amount of money to rectify," he wrote. While Kucinich may be happy with the results, the lawsuit became a punchline of talk show hosts and political commentators. On Wednesday night, CNN's Anderson Cooper put him on his "Ridiculist". "You know what makes the price of food skyrocket?" Cooper said. "Suing a cafeteria for $150,000 for making you a sandwich."
