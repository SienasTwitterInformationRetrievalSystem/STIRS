Trash the dress From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Examples from a "trash the dress" shoot on a beach. Trash The Dress session in Havana,Cuba "Trash the dress", also known as "fearless bridal" or "rock the frock", is a style of wedding photography that contrasts elegant clothing with an environment in which it is out of place. It is generally shot in the style of fashion or glamour photography. Such photography often takes place on a beach, but other locations include city streets, rooftops, garbage dumps, fields, and abandoned buildings. The woman often wears a ball gown, prom dress or wedding dress, and may effectively ruin the dress in the process by getting it wet, dirty, or, in extreme circumstances, tearing or destroying the garment. Some sources claim that the trend was originally started in 2001 by Las Vegas wedding photographer John Michael Cooper,[1] however, the idea of destroying a wedding dress has been used in Hollywood symbolically since at least October 1998 when Meg Cummings of the show Sunset Beach ran into the ocean in her wedding dress after her wedding was interrupted. On 26 August 2012, during a photo shoot at the Ouareau River in Rawdon, Quebec, Canada, Maria Pantazopoulos, a 30-year-old Montreal bride drowned[2] when the dress she was wearing dragged her downstream. The photographer, as well as others, tried to help but were unable to rescue her. Her body was later recovered by a scuba diver.[3] References[edit] Notes ^ Krista Stryker (2008-04-15).

We are so lucky to have mermaid brides and grooms who want to swim with us.  Shooting in these cenotes is a super duper challenge but somehow we manage to make some very interesting images each time.  By the end, we are usually freezing cold with purple lips and because of the nature of these amazing waters, the dress is NOT trashed.  In many cases, the dress is worn again in an at home reception. The trash the dress genre is growing and has changed more into a editorial style / fashion shoot for us.  Luckily, we have the magical waters of the underground rivers (cenotes) that all empty into the caribbean ocean.  The ancient Mayan civilization considered these waters sacred and we are honored to be able to visit them, much less make amazing art images with brides wearing their wedding dress!  cheers- Matt Don’t miss Tarah + Kevin’s gorgeous Wedding Day at the Playacar Palace Resort. Photographer Matt Adcock Location Cenote Month October Comments Inessa March 30, 2013 at 12:39 pm These photos are ablutolesy stunning! The last one of you two kissing in the garage is fabulous, so much passion. And the fact that you are wearing Converse warms my heart :)These are different from any Trash the Dress photos I’ve seen. I love how action shots were incorporated into the mix. Reply Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply. Cenote Trash the Dress Riviera Maya Underwater Photography Close

Re: Honolulu Trash the Dress Photographers Feb 05, 2013, 12:37 PM You are maybe not getting many responses 'cuz none of us old folks know what "Trash the Dress Photographers" means, but I will say Waikiki does a booming business with Japanese brides who get married in Japan and then have photos taken at a whole circuit of spots in Waikiki including the Moana, Royal Hawaiian, the Duke Kahanamoku statue and more. I'd do a search in Yelp and go from there. http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Trash+the+Dress+Photographers&find_loc=Honolulu%2C+HI&ns=1&ls=90603cb026a38b6f Copy and paste the link above.

Re: Honolulu Trash the Dress Photographers Feb 05, 2013, 1:28 PM Trash the dress means the bride wears her bridal gown and is photographed detroying the dress by jumping in a lake or ocean, rolling in mud, or anything else that leaves the dress dirty and tattered.

Re: Honolulu Trash the Dress Photographers Feb 05, 2013, 3:21 PM Well... I must say that I have seen pictures where the bride and groom are at the beach... toes (and dress) in the water, romantic sunset behind them... ahhh looks beautiful! As for me... all I can think of is why didn't they have the "trash the dress" photography back in my day! Instead I paid to have my dress "preserved" so it now sits pretty in a blue box up in my closet waiting for one of my daughters to feel bad about hurting my feelings if she doesn't wear this really dated bridal gown! Oh and my husband went to open the box once to see the dress and I shouted "you can't" it will get ruined... well he looked at me and said how do you know your dress is really in there.... Ummm.... Forget for the love of monkeys.... GO FOR IT! Report inappropriate content swmarket Maui Destination Expert for Ka'anapali, Haleakala National Park posts: 19,141 reviews: 6 Save this Post 8. Re: Honolulu Trash the Dress Photographers Feb 05, 2013, 3:28 PM Aloha, Will you be able to pack your dress and bring it without extra fees? Will you have to pay for it to be pressed? Will it be too hot or heavy to wear here, even for a "trash" shoot? How about either donating the dress or keeping it.............and buying a nice tropical dress here and doing beach photos in that? Call it the "Honeymoon Shoot". Report inappropriate content Tracy O Ottawa, Canada posts: 84 reviews: 15 Save this Post 9. Re: Honolulu Trash the Dress Photographers Feb 05, 2013, 3:30 PM Ummm... yeah ddffpp.... The expression is "Trash the dress" it doesn't mean you have to ruin the dress. I've seen trash the dress shoots where the dress is still in perfectly fine shape after. Please lift the rock your hiding under and come out... its a great world out here if you're willing to live a little. Yeeish. The lady drowned in Montreal (or just outside of Montreal). I'll be careful, but the odds of me getting into a car accident or getting hit by a bus are far more likely than death by wedding gown. Anyway... thank you for all your love of monkeys and not helpful comments... Still just looking for a photographer.

They didn't really trash their dresses either and cleaned and donated the dresses later. Mine was a sales rack clearance dress for $300 that I donated also.
