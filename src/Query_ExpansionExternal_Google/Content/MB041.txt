  Our Advertisers Represent Some Of The Most Unique Products & Services On Earth!     Is This Obama's Birth Certificate From Mombasa, Kenya? Note - This story has been shredded by Snopes. However, in the interest of reporting the full scope of what is being discussed and displayed online, we post the following story. 1-31-11   Here it is, folks! The document we have been waiting for!     Now if only SOMEONE in Congress or the Supreme Court will act on this!   Spread this around.....if these documents are as authentic as they certainly seem to be,    Obama is NOT qualified to be our President and he sits in the White House illegally.   This is what Obama has spent almost $2M (so far) to hide.       Here's a close-up of the top of the document where you can plainly read his name and his parent's names, etc....       A British history buff was asked if he could find out who the colonial registrar was for Mombasa in 1961.   After only a few minutes of research, he called back and said "Sir Edward F. Lavender? Note the same name near the bottom of the photo above.   Source(s): ? Kenya Dominion Record 4667 Australian library."   And here?s a close-up of the bottom of the document where you can read "Coast Providence of Kenya " and the   official signature of the Deputy Registrar.....         The above document is a "Certified Copy of Registration of Birth", but below is a copy of the actual Certificate of Birth...   the real-deal legal kind of certificate.   The Mombasa Registrar of Births has testified that Obama's birth certificate from Coast Province General Hospital in   Mombasa is genuine. This copy was obtained by Lucas Smith through the help of a Kenyan Colonel who recently got it   directly from the Coast General Hospital in Mombasa , Kenya . Here it is.....       Note the footprint!!   The local Muslim Imam in Mombasa named Barack with his Muslim middle name Hussein so his official name on this certificate is Barack Hussein Obama II.   The grandmother of Barack Hussein Obama, Jr. reveals the story of his birth in Mombasa , Kenya , a seaport, after his mother suffered labor pains while swimming at ocean beach in Mombasa   ......   "On August 4, 1961 Obama's mother, father and grandmother were attending a Muslim festival in Mombasa , Kenya .   Mother had been refused entry to airplanes due to her nine month pregnancy. It was a hot August day at the festival so the Obama?s went to the beach to cool off. While swimming in the ocean his mother experienced labor pains so was rushed to the Coast Provincial   General Hospital, Mombasa, Kenya where Obama was born a few hours later at 7:21 pm on August 4, 1961(what a sad day for the USA!). Four days later his mother flew to Hawaii and registered his birth in Honolulu as a certificate of live birth which omitted the place and hospital of birth."    Letter from Kitau in Mombasa , Kenya ......   "I happen to be Kenyan. I was born 1 month before Obama at Mombasa medical center. I am a teacher here at the MM Shaw Primary School in Kenya . I compared my birth certificate to the one that has been put out by Taitz and mine is exactly the same. I even have the same registrar and format. The type is identical. I am by nature a skeptical person. I teach science here and challenge most things that cannot be proven. So I went to an official registrar today and pulled up the picture on the web. They magnified it and determined it to be authentic. There is even a plaque with Registrar Lavenders name on it as he was a Brit and was in charge of the Registrar office from 1959 until January of 1964. The reason the date on the certificate says republic of Kenya is that we were a republic when the "copy" of the original was ordered. I stress the word "copy". My copy also has republic of Kenya . So what you say is true about Kenya not being a republic at the time of Obama's birth, however it was a republic when the copy was ordered.   The birth certificate is genuine. I assure you it will be authenticated by a forensic auditor. We are very proud Obama was born here. We have a shrine for him and there are many people who remember his birth here as he had a white mother. They are being interviewed now by one of your media outlets.    Fortunately they even have pictures of his parents with him immediately after his birth at the Mombasa hospital with the hospital in the back ground.   It will be a proud day for us when it is proven that he was born here and a Kenyan became the most powerful man in the world.   I encourage anyone to come here and visit. I will be happy to take you and show you the pictures at the hospital myself as well as   my document and many others that are identical to what Taitz posted. God Bless. Kitau"   So, how much more proof do we need?     Well, Here it is...{SJC}   WELL, HERE IT IS....         Lolo Soetoro, Stanley Ann Dunham Soetoro, baby Maya Soetoro, and 9 year old Barry Soetoro.       This registration document, made available on Jan. 24, 2007, by the Fransiskus Assisi   school inJakarta, Indonesia , shows the registration of Barack Obama under the name   Barry Soetoro made by his step-father, Lolo Soetoro.     Name: Barry Soetoro Religion: Islam Nationality: Indonesian         How did this little INDONESIAN Muslim child - Barry Soetoro, (A.K.A. Barack Obama) get around the issue of nationality to become President of the United States of America ?     PART 2:   In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obama's qualifications for the presidency, the group "Americans for Freedom of Information" has released copies of President Obama's college transcripts from Occidental College ...     The transcript indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia while an undergraduate at the school. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California . The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify for this scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document provides the smoking gun that many of Obama's detractors have been seeking - that he is NOT a natural-born citizen of the United States - necessary to be President of these United States. Along with the evidence that he was first born in Kenya , here we see that there is no record of him ever applying for US citizenship..   Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama's campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records.     Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still on-going but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused comment on this matter.   LET OTHER FOLKS KNOW THIS NEWS - THE MEDIA WON'T!        Disclaimer   Donate to Rense.com Support Free And Honest Journalism At Rense.com Email Article Subscribe To RenseRadio!

I’m not a funeral director or funeral home employee, nor do I profess to have more than a thimbleful of knowledge on the subject of cremation, but...and that’s a big ‘BUT’...I have seen the cremated remains of a human being, and that was up close and personal. Expecting to see something similar to the ashes scattered in Hollywood sad-scene portrayals, I was truly stunned to see not ashes - not anything CLOSE to ashes - but material the size of gravel. Not to gross anyone out, but this is serious business in this Obie photo. What I saw contained no ‘ash’, no ‘dust’ - nothing which would come anywhere near to wafting off in a wind, let alone a breeze. Our path may follow the ‘ashes-to-ashes, dust-to-dust’ route, but if we’re cremated, a portion of the path to ashes and dust is as dime, nickel, and quarter-sized boney rocks. If anyone knows from having seen actual cremated remains looking like what Barry’s tossing in this photo, I’ll gladly revise my opinion of his theatrical display aimed at garnering sympathy. Trolls considering using the ‘cremated’ victims of 9/11 at the World Trade Center can save themselves the effort by realizing that the degree of heat required to turn those people to what was truly ash - also obliterated the buildings and everything in them. Don’t recall any news reports of the incineration of the crematorium used to turn Madelyn Dunham into the POWDER in this photo.

I recalling hearing in that interview, Evans state that Abercrombie used a search warrant to try and "find" Barry's long form b.c.

Her remains that we placed in a memorial garden were grayish white ash, no chunks or gravel sized pieces. Finer than fireplace ash. Some places such as where my mother was cremated use something similar to a blender/grinder to break the remains down further so they are a powdery ash. I had been warned by others that the pouring of her remains into the open grave night be graphic as there might be teeth or bone fragments but there was not because of the process the crematorium she went to used. 29 posted on 02/01/2011 1:19:11 PM PST by kalee (The offences we give, we write in the dust; Those we take, we engrave in marble.

My sadistic boss made me stick my hand in what he told me was packing material to see what was in the tin. I dug around before he told me it was a cremation. So, I was really up close and personal. What they (Barry and his sister) are throwing off the cliff does not appear to be cremation material as I was familiar with it. What you say is true. Along with some “dust/ash-like” material, a cremation contains a lot of very solid material from pea sized to as big as a dime. Gravel is a pretty good description of it. It's not just ash. Looks to me as though they dumped the contents of their flour canister off the cliff. Not a cremation though.

Two in urns and one in a (travel) cardboard box where the remains were in a heavy plastic bag inside the box. Of the three, I have never seen any particles larger than a sesame seed, if that large. Your description of "quarter-sized" pieces is rather unsettling. First time I've seen the "scattering" photo above and, if legit, what struck me is the volume of the "ash". Was Grannie a large woman? Also, the color seems odd. In my experience it was a much more "Grey" tone, but that may be a factor of the physical cremation equipment, process, temperature, etc. 35 posted on 02/02/2011 12:03:49 AM PST by CanaGuy (Go Harper!

Check out the different Obama COLBs posted online by Obama's campaign. Also, if you missed it, meet the only 2 people to examine the Factcheck.org COLB(s), and one of them wasn't Bill O'Reilly or Anderson Pooper; 1) Daily Kos COLB ; http://images2.dailykos.com/images/user/3/BO_Birth_Certificate.jpg  2) Fight the Smears COLB ; http://www.fightthesmears.com/images/28.jpg   3) Factcheck.org COLB with seal ; http://www.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/birth_certificate_5.jpg   4) Factcheck.org COLB without seal ; http://www.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/birth_certificate_3.jpg   All should view the research compiled at this site ; http://nobarack08.wordpress.com Confirmed: Hawaii Department of Health is Aiding and Abetting Obama & Gangs Forged Certification of Live Birth, Got Final Nail in the Coffin!? -Details at Source. Flashback from the Right Side of Life ; Meet the only 2 people to ever "examine" Obama's SHORT-FORM COLB's. The two FactCheck.org employees who were granted access to Obama’s bogus Certification of Live Birth (COLB) are NOT document examiners or experts. Joe Miller has a Ph. D. in Political Philosophy — so he’s a political operative — while Jess Henig has an M.A. in English Literature — I’m not sure her dye-job is a political or esthetic statement.They are a couple of partisan Obots — just what you’d expect — Jess took the photos presented on their webpage and did all of the writing, while Bob basically held the COLB open for Jess to photograph — suitable work for a Ph. D. Those two are completely unqualified to perform any kind of forensic examination of any document, and FactCheck.org knows it — and so do Henig and Miller. FactCheck does say their, “representatives got a chance to spend some time with the ‘birth certificate,’ and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three-dimensional and resides at the Obama headquarters in Chicago.” In my mind, that clearly shows they were working with and for the Obama Campaign and that Obama and his people are involved in this lie. Much more HERE. And this; - Blogger manipulates birth certificate image, undermining Obama claims - Jay McKinnon, a self-described Department of Homeland Security-trained document specialist, has implicated himself in the production of palpably fake Hawaii birth certificate images similar to the one endorsed as genuine by the Barack Obama campaign, and appearing on the same Daily Kos blog entry where the supposedly authentic document appears. Much more HERE and HERE. And this oldie; Hawaii Officials refuse to verify president's online COLBs images released by Obama's campaign and FactCheck.org... In response to a direct question from WND, the Hawaii Department of Health refused to authenticate either of the two versions of President Obama's short-form Certificate of Live Birth, or COLB, posted online – neither the image produced by the Obama campaign nor the images released by FactCheck.org. Janice Okubu, the public information officer for the Hawaii DOH, also had no explanation for why Dr. Fukino's initial press release last October and subsequent press release also avoided declaring the posted images to be of authentic documents. FactCheck.org, an organization funded by the same left-leaning Annenberg Foundation that also employed Barack Obama and former Weatherman radical bomber Bill Ayers, produced a short-form Obama COLB that was very different in appearance than the campaign released. Source. And much more HERE. Forgery is nothing new to the Obama campaign, via Debbie Schlussel ; Obama’s Selective Service Draft Registration Raises Serious Questions. Did President-elect Barack Hussein Obama commit a federal crime in September of this(last) year? Or did he never actually register and, instead, did friends of his in the Chicago federal records center, which maintains the official copy of his alleged Selective Service registration commit the crime for him? It’s either one or the other, as indicated by the release of Barack Obama’s official Selective Service registration for the draft. The full investigative report is HERE. And via Give us Liberty; EXPLOSIVE...more proof that AKA OBAMA is a fraud and very likely not even an American citizen!... - Obama conspiracy – It’s no longer just a theory - A man who fails to register with SS before turning 26 may find that some doors are permanently closed. This is a must read HERE. Bonus; CONFIRMED: Factcheck.org Published Bogus Fact Regarding Obama’s British/Kenyan Citizenship. We can report that it has been conclusively established – the Factcheck.org report contains false information. Factcheck.org – Inaccuracy #1: Obama’s Kenyan Citizenship did not expire on Aug 4, 1982. Factcheck.org was absolutely wrong when they reported Obama’s Kenyan citizenship expired on Aug 4, 1982. Factcheck.org – Inaccuracy #2: While Obama’s status as a British citizen may have been short lived, Factcheck.org failed to state that his status as a British subject was not short lived. Research has discovered multiple legal mechanisms which have the potential to establish that Obama is now a full citizen of Kenya as well as the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Commonwealth of Nations and the Republic of Indonesia.

ReplyDelete Anonymous February 2, 2011 at 9:42 PM The birth certificate is nothing but a red herring. The fact that Obama Senior was NEVER a U.S. Citizen automatically disqualified Obama Junior as a natural born Citizen. "Strunk vs. Paterson et al." 29642-08. New York Supreme Court, 18 January, 2011. The Honorable Supreme Court Justice David I. Schmidt ruled that Obama Junior is ABSOLUTELY NOT a natural born Citizen. The next week, Tim Adams, a former Senior Elections Clerk from Hawaii SWORE UNDER OATH UNDER PENALTY of PERJURY "THERE IS NO BIRTH CERTIFICATE ON FILE FOR OBAMA JUNIOR IN HAWAII". It has become patently obvious that Obama Junior is a pathological liar and now he has been trapped in his web of deception. "0" is up to his nose in his own doo doo and his removal from office is only a matter of time. OBAMA = THE NEW NIXON. It took over two years to prove the Watergate conspiracy and force Nixon to resign, so we're running right on time uncovering the criminal acts committed by Obama and forcing his resignation...When Obama soon leaves Washington as a caught, convicted, and disgraced criminal, all patriotic Americans will shout in unison GOD BLESS AMERICA, OBAMA THE TYRANT IS GONE!

Last week, Arizona state Rep. Judy Burges, a Republican, introduced a bill that would bar presidential candidates who do not prove they were born in the United States from appearing on the ballot in the Grand Canyon state. And state Rep. Chad Campbell, the top Democrat in the GOP-controlled Arizona House of Representatives, tells Mother Jones that the bill is likely to pass. It was introduced with 25 co-sponsors in the House and 16 co-sponsors in the state Senate; the measure needs 31 votes in the House and 16 in the Senate for approval. "Will it matter?" asks Campbell. "We've started a tradition here of passing legislation that is political grandstanding or that sets up litigation." Advertise on MotherJones.com But the birthers—those ardent Obama foes who believe the president was not born in Hawaii and, thus, is not constitutionally qualified serve as president—see this measure as more than symbolic. For them, it's part of a well-orchestrated campaign to deny Obama reelection. It's not that Obama necessarily requires Arizona's 10 electoral votes to win reelection in 2012. In 2008, he lost there to John McCain,  Arizona's senior senator (though in 2012, Obama could make a play for the state). More important, Burges' bill—which would establish a strict standard for proving natural-born citizenship (which the birthers presume Obama could not meet)—is a model for other states, and similar efforts are under way in Pennsylvania, Missouri, Montana, Georgia, and Texas. (Obama won Pennsylvania in 2008 and lost Missouri by less than 4,000 votes.) Arizona may be where this birther ball gets rolling. "We've started a tradition here of passing legislation that is political grandstanding or that sets up litigation." Last year, Burges introduced a similar measure that stalled in committee. Her new one is much tougher. The original bill would have set up a system under which a presidential candidate would have to document his or her citizenship to be listed on the state ballot. Here's how it would work: The national political party would submit an affidavit from its presidential candidate in which the candidate states his citizenship, and this affidavit would have to be supported by "documents that prove that the candidate is a natural born citizen." Arizona's secretary of the state would then review the affidavit and supporting documents, and if there were "reasonable cause to believe the candidate does not meet the citizenship" requirement, the secretary of state would be able to keep the candidate off the ballot. This system left discretion to the secretary of state. And Burges' original bill did not specify what documents would be acceptable. Consequently, the certification of live birth that the Obama campaign produced in 2008 might well qualify as sufficient documentation under that measure.  Burges' new version raises the bar. It notes that the affidavit must be accompanied by "an original long form birth certificate that includes the date and place of birth, the names of the hospital and the attending physician and signatures of the witnesses in attendance." (The other documentation required would include a list "that identifies the candidate's places of residence in the United States for the preceding fourteen years.") And the law states that if the candidate fails to submit these records, the secretary of state "shall not" place his or her name on state ballot. There's no wiggle room: Produce a long-form birth certificate, or no ballot-listing. That certification of live birth issued by the Hawaiian government would not count. (Two weeks ago, radio personality Mike Evans said he had been told by Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie that no original birth certificate could be found for Obama—a remark that lit up the birther community—but this past week, Evans said he had been misunderstood. Meanwhile, Hawaiian legislators have introduced a bill charging anyone requesting Obama's birth records—meaning that certification of live birth—$100, in order to cut down on birther requests.)

Birthers are eager to prove Obama can't be President by forcing all Presidential candidates to release something called a "long form" birth certificate." Any who fail to do so would be left off the Arizona ballot. This will apparently be a challenge for anyone from Hawaii, which keeps all it's forms electronically, and cannot legally give out long form birth certificates. It would be hilarious if the Red States screwed themselves by making it illegal for the GOP candidate to appear on their ballots. The best way to find this out is probably get a large group of people to ask their states for a long-form certificate, and see who says no.

Separate multiple keywords with commas. Tagging tips - Search For Tags - Browse For Tags ? More Tagging tips: A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find? Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office. If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race. Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful. Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: Civil Rights, Community, Congress, Culture, Economy, Education, Elections, Energy, Environment, Health Care, International, Labor, Law, Media, Meta, National Security, Science, Transportation, or White House. If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state (California, Texas, etc).

I'm sincerely curious.  As indicated somewhere way below your post, I do genealogy research in several states and two continents.  In the US I request photocopies of original documents because I don't like certified copies (too easy for typos to occur), and I've never heard of a "long form" birth certificate until all this birther crap started being talked about.

And pray to GOD - hatemailapalooza, 052210 by punditician on Tue Feb 01, 2011 at 04:46:10 PM PST  Not to nitpick the question itself, (19+ / 0-) Recommended by: JohnInWestland, sponson, bablhous, catleigh, ferallike, Kimball Cross, SherriG, happy camper, 5x5, NonnyO, madame damnable, lostboyjim, Dirtandiron, Vita Brevis, ItsSimpleSimon, HylasBrook, Mortifyd, Dom9000, charliehall2 but the problem is, there's no magical "long form birth certificate."  That phrase means different things to different states. The Arizona law requiring a so-called "long form birth certificate", which by definition in that law requires info such as the doctor's name and the names of the witnesses, is unconstitutional AND a substantive violation of basic states rights. The US Constitutional requirements are straightforward, and this Arizona law aims at the age requirement and the natural born requirement.  For "natural born" status, a US birth (certain certain overseas exceptions) counts as "natural born."  Therefore, proof of birth in the United States would satisfy this requirement. Birth records are the responsibility of the states, and they each have their own system.  If one state's records department is willing to issue a legal document, stamped and certified, stating the place of birth and ONLY the place of birth, that satisfies the Constitutional requirements.  Arizona cannot tell Hawaii how to run its vital records department, and Arizona can't look at Hawaii's birth certificate and say "it doesn't have 5 witnesses and the names of all nurses involved, not good enough."  It's unconstitutional.

This is the one I used to get my DL, my follow up passports, SS card, etc. my whole childhood. Old Reliable. My parents have or had a hospital form which many people confuse with a legal long form - it's not.  It's a nice chotchky.  This is often the thing Birfers describe as a Long Form - but it's not. As an adult, when I thought I had lost previously noted certified copy (Old Reliable) I went and got a new copy - which is now completely different than Old Reliable - which I found.  Neither of which are handy since I am not at home, but at my cousin's apartment. Old copy is a photostat of something the size of an index card with a seal pressed into it.  It notes mine and my parents info but does not contain anything about the doctor etc.   New copy is on "gender appropriate" paper with "safety features" like a cheque - and lists even less than Old Reliable did.  It's also bigger despite being mostly empty space and a giant seal. When I called and asked about the differences I was told it was due to privacy that there were differences.   And the paper colour thing is because my birth state tries intentionally to screw over transgendered people.   Does that clarify or do I need more caffeine? Intimidation is not dialogue. by Mortifyd on Tue Feb 01, 2011 at 05:50:33 PM PST [ Parent ]  That does clarify things (0+ / 0-) I'm sure plenty of birthers do confuse a "hospital" birth certificate, which as you said is basically just a "chotchky", and the original, "long-form" birth certificate, which is the original document filed with the state contemporaneously with the birth. As you also correctly note, that original, long-form birth certificate varies in format by state and over time, with more (or less) information contained therein depending on the time and place where it was issued. In the case of Hawaii, however, we do know exactly what kinds of birth certificates were issued to kids born at hospitals at the time that Obama was, and it is a "long-form" that did include the hospital and a doctor's signature. I'd be surprised if your original birth certificate wasn't signed by someone because a witness is a key, foundational element of all original birth and death certificates of which I am aware. The birth certificate that you got more recently as a replacement for your original is as far as I can tell from your description what's commonly referred to as the "short-form". As opposed to being a copy of the original document (the "photostat" as you called it), the short-form is a completely new document that is generated at the time of the request from the records on file in the database. With the transition to electronic records, it became unnecessary in most cases to go into the archives and get a copy of the original document, when a new document could just be printed out based on the electronic record. In President Obama's case, we have the short-form, which is the standard format for birth certificates issued by the State since they transitioned to electronic records. Assuming that he was in fact born at Kapiolani Hospital in Honolulu as has been reported, the "source" document from which this certificate was generated would in fact also be on file in the archives in the form of an original, long-form birth certificate, which document could be made public upon his request. by Pilkington on Tue Feb 01, 2011 at 06:09:20 PM PST [ Parent ]  "Assuming that he was" (4+ / 0-) Recommended by: bablhous, twigg, 5x5, Mortifyd Interesting choice of wording. by pat of butter in a sea of grits on Tue Feb 01, 2011 at 06:39:48 PM PST [ Parent ]  yeah it is...

It's been reported that he was born at Kapiolani Hospital in Honolulu, but I don't think that has ever been confirmed by either the hospital (becaue of medical privacy laws) or the President himself (because why should he give a fuck?). If you can find a link where it was confirmed by either the hospital or the White House that President Obama was born at Kapiolani (as opposed to somewhere else in Hawaii) then there would be no need to "assume" that particular fact. As far as I know, the actual, specific hospital where he was born in Hawaii hasn't been established as a fact one way or the other. He can of course have been born in many places in Hawaii other than at Kapiolani Hospital. by Pilkington on Tue Feb 01, 2011 at 06:54:47 PM PST [ Parent ]  Actually "assuming" was the correct term :) (1+ / 0-) Recommended by: Pilkington Some assumptions are easy to make, and the term was used correctly because it has been "stated" that he was born in that hospital, but not confirmed.

(0+ / 0-) But Hawaiian state law states that what you get is the certified form, you don't GET a "long form" so Arizona would be requiring Hawaii to break it's own law to accommodate their law. So they are asking for something Hawaii doesn't give out, knowing they don't give it out in order to prevent the Arizona citizens the opportunity to vote for Obama.   Sounds like they are intentionally trying to make sure he's not an option on the ballot to me - and I lived in Phoenix for a decade and was a regular voter, so I am familiar with the state and it's... peculiarities. Intimidation is not dialogue. by Mortifyd on Tue Feb 01, 2011 at 10:42:29 PM PST [ Parent ]  I'm pretty sure that you are wrong on this (0+ / 0-) The Governor and the Attorney General are the people most qualified to determine the answer to the question of what kind of birth documentation the State of Hawaii "gives out", and they have made it very clear why Obama's original birth certificate cannot be released: HONOLULU – A privacy law that shields birth certificates has prompted Democratic Gov. Neil Abercrombie to abandon efforts to dispel claims that President Barack Obama was born outside Hawaii, his office says. State Attorney General David Louie told the governor that privacy laws bar him from disclosing an individual's birth documentation without the person's consent, Abercrombie spokeswoman Donalyn Dela Cruz said Friday. .  .  . Abercrombie, who was a friend of Obama's parents and knew him as a child, launched an investigation last month into whether he can release more information about the president's Aug. 4, 1961 birth. The governor said at the time he was bothered by people who questioned Obama's birthplace for political reasons. But Abercrombie's attempt reached a dead end when Louie told him the law restricted his options. Hawaii's privacy laws have long barred the release of a certified birth certificate to anyone who doesn't have a tangible interest. http://news.yahoo.com/... Clearly, Obama qualifies as having a "tangible interest" in his own birth certificate. Again, however, I don't see the problem. It's been verified that the original birth certificate is on file with the state, and if Arizona requires a copy of it, I'm sure that the Obama Administration will request one, and some bureacrat in the State of Hawaii is not going to cause a constitutional crisis by refusing to provide the POTUS with a copy of his own birth certificate so that he can run for re-election. I find it hard to believe that you believe that is a possibility. Again, as I asked the diarist, I'd love to see a cite to a law prohibiting the state of Hawaii from providing someone with a copy of their original birth certificate. Absent, evidence of such a law, I just don't find it logical or believable that one exists. by Pilkington on Wed Feb 02, 2011 at 06:21:40 AM PST [ Parent ]  I asked Baby Jew Lawyer (0+ / 0-) I'm a baker by trade.

Clearly, Obama has a tangible interest in his own birth certificate. If he wants it, he can have it. That's why there's no reason to believe that the Arizona law will make any difference whatsoever. If they require it, he will request it, and Hawaii will provide it. I don't know why there's any reason for confusion or "not knowing the answer", other than just wanting to be obtuse about it, for what reason I have no clue. by Pilkington on Wed Feb 02, 2011 at 08:06:26 AM PST [ Parent ]  No, I think you are (0+ / 0-) There is no reason the documentation he's already shown as required should not suffice.

They would still run afoul of full faith and credit by placing extra conditions in order to be on the state ballot.   The issue is a federal issue because it would be between two states. Arizona's law can't conflict with the federal regs and the have no right to demand the long form when the short form is available.  They have to give the short form full faith and credit because the states are equal.   The person to decide this will be a Federal Judge, not a governor or an AG, because it's a Diversity of Citizenship case.  So sayeth Baby Jew Lawyer. Have a nice day. Intimidation is not dialogue. by Mortifyd on Wed Feb 02, 2011 at 08:54:00 AM PST [ Parent ]  OK, ignorance is not dialogue either (0+ / 0-) There is no "conflict with the federal regs" because there are no federal regulations saying anything one way or the other about natural born citizenship, short-forms, long-forms, or any of these issues. There is no issue of Arizona having "a right to demand the long form when the short form is available" because the short form has never been demanded or presented either. It was shown on the Internet and to certain journalists, but it's never been presented to any Secretary of State as proof of eligibility for office for the obvious reason that it has never been requested by any Secretary of State as proof of eligibility for office. You're imagining some hypothetical case where Arizona passes this law, and Obama presents his short-form, and the Secretary of State refuses to accept it, and demands the long-form, and Obama goes to court to challenge that refusal, and yes, in that case, a federal judge would decide whether or not to require Arizona to accept the short-form. But that hypothetical situation is a long ways from where we are now, and it's pretty unlikely that things will develop in that manner, IMHO. More likely, either the law will simply end up requiring whatever form of birth certificate the state in question commonly issues, and short-form will be sufficient, or Obama will present the long-form. Either way, I don't see it as presenting a problem for Obama, and I don't see why you do. by Pilkington on Wed Feb 02, 2011 at 10:03:54 AM PST [ Parent ]  I guess I didn't say it clearly.

He now says he can't because of privacy concerns. He hasn't gotten very specific on the concerns. My guess is that some nurse there doesn't want the birthers calling her to "verify" her signature. It's also p0ossible Obama himself refuses to agree to the release, because he doesn't want to encourage idiots.

Abercrombie was idiotic is promising to "use his powers as Governor" to make the documents public, when it doesn't matter if God request the certificate: if Obama does not agree it its release, it's staying in the vaults.

As for the Constitutional crap, don't be so quick to come to the conclusion the law will be thrown out. As far as the Federal Government is concerned there are exactly 538 Presidential votes that matter: those belonging to official Presidential Electors. Under the US Constitution these are selected by state legislatures. We get to check a box by Obama or McCain because all 50 state legislatures have generously decided to pick the guy their people want. Why would it be the Federal government's business if this state election is only open to people who pledge to support certain candidates? BTW, there is a potential way around this bill, which may make all my former speculation irrelevant: once an elector has the job it's probable the state can't make him do anything because he's a Federal official.

My name is misspelled.  On the front they correct the spelling by double underlying the offending letter, then spelling it correctly in parentheses just above the misspelling. They got my mother's first name wrong. The prophylactic used to prevent opthalmia neonatorum (pinkeye) was, according to my birth certificate, silver ni rate (sic)  1% norman (sic) saline. That norman saline is not to be confused with the saxon variety.  Reminds me of Marty Feldman and Abby Normal. There's a seal and an originally signed stamp on the back that contains my name, still misspelled, no correction on the stamp. It does ask if I was legitimate, in which block I can't quite make out, sort of faded, looks like bast...something. Oh, and it does say I was born alive, which is probably why I was issued a passport so easily. On the back there are a bunch of questions, none answered on my copy, but they do ask if a midwife was involved. Clearly, it's a good thing I decided not to accept the nomination of my party for president.

(1+ / 0-) Recommended by: truong son traveler ... if this is a bogus claim. As a genealogist, I order birth, marriage, and death certificate copies to document my ancestors. Some states have index information online with a name and date of birth or marriage or death (depending on the database).  I always request a photocopy of the original document because I don't like certified copies (typos can occur, and in the case of one of my gr-grandmothers, the cause of death was not listed on the certified copy; I've since gotten a digital image of the ledger of the death records kept at that period of time, and now know her cause of death).  Some counties do a photocopy of the original document and certify it (as with my other gr-grandparents who got their marriage license in Dakota Territory) - price is the same. In other countries, images of official birth, marriage, death records are online (free in some countries) clear back to the late 1600s. I know what these records look like in my own state, other states, and in a couple of European countries. I've seen the .jpg that Markos published of Obama's birth certificate.  It is in official format and gives the same info as found in other states: name of child, date, time, location of birth; name of mother, name of father.  That's all that's required for a birth certificate. I do not understand what this "long form" birth certificate crap is all about. When someone gives me a full explanation of the difference between a long and short form birth certificate, in what states this phenomenon occurs, and shows me pictures of what the difference is, maybe I will stop being so confused over what these reichwingnuts are talking about. For now, I'm left with the opinion that they're talking out of their arses again. I'm sick of attempts to steer this nation from principles evolved in The Age of Reason to hallucinations derived from illiterate herdsmen. ~ Crashing Vor by NonnyO on Wed Feb 02, 2011 at 03:31:33 AM PST    (0 / 0) by you on soon If this is OK, click Post:   Or you may make changes below and Preview again, or Cancel this comment.
