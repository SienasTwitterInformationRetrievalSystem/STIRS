Eng., Texas A&M Univ., College Station, TX, USA ; Ghoshal, P. ; Grot, B. ; Gratz, P.V. more authors Abstract Authors References Cited By Keywords Metrics Similar Download Citation Email Print As processor chips become increasingly parallel, an efficient communication substrate is critical for meeting performance and energy targets. In this work, we target the root cause of network energy consumption through techniques that reduce link and router-level switching activity. We specifically focus on memory subsystem traffic, as it comprises the bulk of NoC load in a CMP. By transmitting only the flits that contain words predicted useful using a novel spatial locality predictor, our scheme seeks to reduce network activity. We aim to further lower NoC energy through microarchitectural mechanisms that inhibit datapath switching activity for unused words in individual flits. Using simulation-based performance studies and detailed energy models based on synthesized router designs and different link wire types, we show that (a) the prediction mechanism achieves very high accuracy, with an average misprediction rate of just 2.5%; (b) the combined NoC energy savings enabled by the predictor and microarchitectural support are 35% on average and up to 60% in the best case; and (c) the performance impact of these energy optimizations is negligible.

Management Team Partners Philanthropy Contact Us Blog Events Ten Tips To Reduce Energy Consumption & Save Money By Kelley Crawford Feb 03, 2011 Energy Management Figuring out some bright ideas to help save your organization money is a daunting task in a world filled with costly equipment, huge overhead and shrinking staffs. However, there is more than one way to cut back and see some budget savings. Here are a few tips to consider when looking for ways to reduce your energy consumption and save your organization money. 1. Lighting modernization  Replacing older bulbs with newer more energy efficient bulbs is an inexpensive way to begin to save energy. Implementing lighting controls, sensors and dimmers in certain environments can also save money and decrease unnecessary energy use in spaces that aren’t occupied after a certain time or need less lighting. Retrofitting lighting is also an efficient way to get your facility on the track to minimizing energy use. It involves replacing components in the fixture or, in some cases, the complete fixture is replaced to make it more energy efficient. 2. Variable frequency drives (VFD) A VFD is a system for controlling the speed of an electric motor by controlling the frequency of the electrical power supplied to the motor. These drives have the option to vary the speed of the fans based on the load being used. Variable-frequency drives should be used with larger motors and fans in the facility to maximize energy efficiency. For example, in ventilation systems for large buildings, variable-frequency motors on fans save energy by allowing the volume of air moved to match the system demand. 3. Chiller plant efficiency It is estimated that chillers consume 20 percent of the total electrical energy generated in North America, making it very important to reduce consumption in this area. Water-cooled chillers, which use water to remove the heat, are twice as energy efficient as air-cooled chillers, which use the flow of outside air to remove heat from the chiller. Newer chillers often have variable frequency drives (mentioned above). In older systems, cooling tower fans run continuously at full speed, causing excess energy and dollars to be wasted. 4. Boiler plant efficiency Similar to chillers, older boilers for heating systems are constantly going at full speed. There are two energy saving options with boilers – retrofitting or replacing. While a large cost upfront, replacing boilers with new efficient technologies will save money in the long run. Newer boilers have the ability to change capacity when the full heat is not needed. Retrofitting boilers with new burners and controls may have similar savings as replacement boilers but at a lower investment cost. 5. Steam trap maintenance and replacement A steam trap regulates how much heat is allowed through a terminal device (radiator, patient room fan coil units, etc). Steam traps usually fail because certain parts are not working the way they are supposed to work. Often times they end up in a fully open position, allowing too much heat to get through, resulting in both wasted energy and dollars. There could be hundreds or even thousands of steam traps in a large facility. Every year 20 percent of the steam traps should be replaced and all should be checked for maintenance issues. A good way to manage this process is to develop a five-year maintenance plan. 6. Building automation system (BAS) BAS core functionality keeps the building climate within a specified range, provides lighting based on an occupancy schedule, and monitors system performance and device failures and provides email and/or text notifications to building engineering staff. The BAS functionality reduces building energy and maintenance costs when compared to a non-controlled building. Although some systems are initially expensive, over time these devices will save money by efficiently controlling temperatures and energy levels. 7. Repairing air leaks in air handlers Regularly checking for leaks in air handlers will prevent using excess energy and will also save money from having to do extensive repairs. One easy way to see if you have leaks from ducts or air handling units is to feel the temperature in your mechanical room in the hot summer months. If your mechanical room feels comfortable or even a little cold during the warm months, then there is most likely a leak. 8. Replacement of damaged pipes and duct insulation Making sure insulation leaks are repaired is very important to keep heating and air conditioning from being wasted. If leaks occur, more heat is needed to get temperatures up and more cooling will be used to get temperatures lower than would normally be necessary. Replacing damaged pipes and repairing insulation immediately will help prevent unnecessary energy use. 9. Utility bill reconciliation A utility company often charges according to a power factor. The lower the power factor, the more inefficient your electrical system is in using the power received from the utility company. If your facility has a low power factor, then you will be penalized with added charges. To avoid these extra charges, you can use power factor correction capacitors to increase the power factor of your system. The installation of power factor capacitors on the user's electrical distribution system eliminates the necessity of paying penalties to the utility company for poor power factor. 10. FACILITYDUDE!!! With the cost of facility upkeep comprising such a large portion of a company's budget, it is vital that operational efficiencies are maximized. To achieve such goals, organizations must find effective ways to streamline their maintenance, inventory, and utility functions.  Call FacilityDude today to learn more about how our web-based facility management tools can help your organization save money, increase efficiency and improve services.

gcsescience.com       41                gcsescience.com Power Stations How to Reduce Energy Use. There is an increasing demand for energy as more people in the world want to improve their standard of living. Some energy resources are not renewable and some have bad environmental effects. This page suggests some ways in which we can reduce our energy use. Energy is mainly used for heating and transport. Less energy is required for computers, TVs and lighting. Reducing energy use means just using less energy or using the energy more efficiently. Heating Buildings. A lot of heat is used to keep buildings warm. This makes the buildings more comfortable to use and stops the material of the building getting damp and decaying. The main way to reduce energy use is to use insulation. Heating Water. A lot of energy is used to heat water. Hot water tanks need insulation but we can reduce the amount of hot water we use by 1. Having taps that turn off properly and don't keep dripping. 2. Taking a shower instead of a bath (although a power shower left running for a few minutes will still use loads of hot water). Transport. Aircraft use a lot of fuel compared to other forms of transport. Try not to fly too often and buy fruit and vegetables which have been grown locally (or grow your own). Cars with smaller engines use less fuel. You can use your car less by 1. Share a car with someone else. 2. Use public transport (bus or train). 3. Use a bicycle or walk instead of using a car for short trips. Computer and TV. 1. Don't leave them switched on when you are not using them. 2. Don't leave them on standby - turn them off at the socket. Lights. 1. Don't leave them switched on when you are not using them. 2. Use energy saving bulbs or LED lighting.   Links   Electromagnetism   Induced Current   Revision Questions   gcsescience.com        Physics Quiz        Index        Power Station Quiz        gcsescience.com Home      GCSE Chemistry      GCSE Physics Copyright © 2014 Dr. Colin France.

Hidden vegetables: an effective strategy to reduce energy intake and increase vegetable intake in adults. Blatt AD 1, Roe LS, Rolls BJ. Author information 1Department of Nutritional Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 16802, USA. Abstract BACKGROUND: The overconsumption of energy-dense foods leads to excessive energy intakes. The substitution of low-energy-dense vegetables for foods higher in energy density can help decrease energy intakes but may be difficult to implement if individuals dislike the taste of vegetables. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether incorporating puréed vegetables to decrease the energy density of entrées at multiple meals reduced daily energy intakes and increased daily vegetable intakes. DESIGN: In this crossover study, 20 men and 21 women ate ad libitum breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the laboratory once a week for 3 wk. Across conditions, entrées at meals varied in energy density from standard versions (100% condition) to reduced versions (85% and 75% conditions) by the covert incorporation of 3 or 4.5 times the amount of puréed vegetables. Entrées were accompanied by unmanipulated side dishes. Participants rated their hunger and fullness before and after meals. RESULTS: Subjects consumed a consistent weight of foods across conditions of energy density; thus, the daily energy intake significantly decreased by 202 ± 60 kcal in the 85% condition (P < 0.001) and by 357 ± 47 kcal in the 75% condition (P < 0.0001). Daily vegetable consumption significantly increased from 270 ± 17 g of vegetables in the 100% condition to 487 ± 25 g of vegetables in the 75% condition (P < 0.0001). Despite the decreased energy intake, ratings of hunger and fullness did not significantly differ across conditions. Entrées were rated as similar in palatability across conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Large amounts of puréed vegetables can be incorporated into various foods to decrease the energy density. This strategy can lead to substantial reductions in energy intakes and increases in vegetable intakes. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01165086.

Heating and cooling can then be implemented in accordance with usage, reducing the amount of energy consumption and carbon emitted overall. Currently, it is only once an environment has reached a threshold temperature (hot or cold) that the appropriate action is activated (cooling or heating), resulting in excess energy being consumed. Outcomes will feed into strategies for optimising building usage and will inform ongoing mobile application development, whereby students are informed of the closest available PC within a lab environment. Specifically the project will: 1) Establish benchmark energy consumption levels and room occupancy levels, before and after technical development; 2) Conduct interval metering of all appropriate system parameters to ensure adequate control / output monitoring; and 3) Develop a software application in line with requirements identified with a view to reducing overall energy consumption and maximising building usage, in line with occupancy requirements and user satisfaction.
