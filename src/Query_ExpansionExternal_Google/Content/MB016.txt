Abstract Authors References Cited By Keywords Metrics Similar Download Citation Email Print Request Permissions We consider spectrum sensing of OFDM signals in an AWGN channel. For the case of completely known noise and signal powers, we set up a vector-matrix model for an OFDM signal with a cyclic prefix and derive the optimal Neyman-Pearson detector from first principles. The optimal detector exploits the inherent correlation of the OFDM signal incurred by the repetition of data in the cyclic prefix, using knowledge of the length of the cyclic prefix and the length of the OFDM symbol. We compare the optimal detector to the energy detector numerically. We show that the energy detector is near-optimal (within 1 dB SNR) when the noise variance is known. Thus, when the noise power is known, no substantial gain can be achieved by using any other detector than the energy detector. For the case of completely unknown noise and signal powers, we derive a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based on empirical second-order statistics of the received data. The proposed GLRT detector exploits the non-stationary correlation structure of the OFDM signal and does not require any knowledge of the noise power or the signal power. The GLRT detector is compared to state-of-the-art OFDM signal detectors, and shown to improve the detection performance with 5 dB SNR in relevant cases.

Details for Known and Unknown - Donald Rumsfeld Created by jjj444yes 3 years ago Audio Books : Mainstream : MP3/128Kbps : English Known and Unknown by Donald Rumsfeld UNABRIDGED Narrated by Donald Rumsfeld 128 kbps audible LENGTH 30 hrs and 11 mins "If you are not criticized, you may not be doing much." - Rumsfeld's Rules Few Americans have spent more time near the center of power than Donald Rumsfeld. Now he has written an unflinching memoir of his half-century career, sharing previously undisclosed details that will fascinate readers and force historians to rethink many controversies. Starting from a middle-class childhood in Illinois, Rumsfeld had a rapid rise that won him early acclaim. He shows us what it was like growing up during the Great Depression and World War II, going to Princeton on scholarships, serving as a naval aviator, then getting his first political job on Capitol Hill during the Eisenhower administration. He recalls how he won a seat in the House of Representatives at age thirty and what he experienced as a Republican in Congress during the Kennedy and Johnson years. We also follow him back to the executive branch as he took on key cabinet positions in the Nixon and Ford administrations, including his service as the youngest-ever secretary of defense, just after the trauma of Vietnam. And we learn about the challenges he later faced as a CEO in the private sector, and during his special assignments for President Reagan, including a face-to-face meeting with Saddam Hussein in 1983. All of that would have been enough material for a fascinating book. But as 2001 began, Rumsfeld's greatest challenges lay ahead of him. At age sixty-eight he returned to the Pentagon as President Bush's secretary of defense, with a mandate to transform the military for a new century. Just nine months later he would confront the worst acts of terrorism in American history, followed by unexpected wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. And he would be on the firing line for many controversies, from the revelations of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison to allegations of torture at GuantÃ¡namo Bay. Known and Unknown reveals what happened behind the scenes during the critical moments of the Bush years, as the President's inner circle debated how best to defend our country. It is based not only on Rumsfeld's memory but also on hundreds of previously unreleased documents from throughout his career. It also features his blunt, firsthand opinions about some of the world's best-known figures, from Margaret Thatcher to Elvis Presley, from Henry Kissinger to Colin Powell, and about each American president from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George W. Bush. In a famous press briefing, Rumsfeld once remarked that "there are also unknown unknowns . . . things we do not know we don't know." His book makes us realize just how much we didn't know. Donald Rumsfeld is donating his proceeds from the sales of Known and Unknown to the military charities supported by the Rumsfeld Foundation. About the Author Donald Rumsfeld was the thirteenth and twenty-first U.S. secretary of defense. He currently chairs the Rumsfeld Foundation, which supports leadership and public service at home and the growth of free political and free economic systems abroad. The Rumsfeld Foundation funds global microfinance projects, fellowships for graduate students interested in public service, linkages between young leaders from central Asia and the United States, and charitable causes that benefit the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their families. Married in 1954, he and his wife Joyce have three children and seven grandchildren. They currently reside in New Mexico. - Size: 1.62 GB   Download this torrent Direct Download Download the torrent Download as magnet link Download torrent anonymously <\/scr'+'ipt>'); &lt;a href=&quot;http://torr-d.torrpedoads.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=517eaca238028&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://torr-d.torrpedoads.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=393459&amp;cs=517eaca238028&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Extra information Tracker: http://inferno.demonoid.me:3415/announce Last seeder activity: 1 year ago Files described inside the torrent: 5 [ Click here to show the full list ] Comments << Prev       Next >> | 1 - 15 | 16 - 20 | Posted by mysticeyes 3 years ago [ Complain ] [ Send PM ] Chicken hawk alert!!

Rumsfeld is interviewed at his office in Washington.AP2011 WASHINGTON -- If the memoir of Donald Rumsfeld, among the most powerful and controversial U.S. secretaries of defense, catches on with readers and critics, he could cite one of his many "Rumsfeld's Rules": "The harder I work, the luckier I am." ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT When Rumsfeld began thinking about his book, "Known and Unknown," he imagined a more typical Washington release: a quick, impressionistic story based on whatever he recalled.  Instead, he and a team of six aides worked four years on what became a 700-page narrative, with an additional 100-plus pages of end notes. Dozens of books were consulted and thousands of documents reviewed, from White House memos to letters Rumsfeld's parents wrote to each other during World War II. Rumsfeld's sister Joan and former Secretary of State George Shultz were among the friends, family members and colleagues who came to Washington for conversations. "I started thinking about this amazing archive I had," he said during a recent interview. "The fact that I had it persuaded me that I ought to take advantage of it." Rumsfeld is seated in a conference room at his office suite, where the walls document a long, high-level life of politics and history: a photograph of then-Rep. Rumsfeld with President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s; a signed copy of President Gerald Ford's swearing-in statement in 1974; a piece of shrapnel from the hijacked plane that struck the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.  At 78, Rumsfeld had enough energy to narrate the audio edition of the book himself -- eight days of recording, eight hours a day. He looks grayer, but otherwise little changed from his time as defense secretary under President George W. Bush, with his rimless glasses and quick, confident grin. For much of his career in public office, Rumsfeld has been compiling information. As a Republican congressman from Illinois, he kept records on every vote he made and the reason for each decision. He held on to notes from presidential briefings and recorded thoughts and ideas into a Dictaphone.  Rumsfeld has set up a website, www.rumsfeld.com (which goes live on publication day, Feb. 8), that allows visitors to link to the documents he used as source material. During his interview, Rumsfeld showed samples, including eight pages of notes from a briefing Johnson gave in 1966 on the Vietnam War and White House papers from July 1975, when he was chief of staff under President Ford, with passages initialed by Rumsfeld's then-assistant, Dick Cheney. "It's not a journal, it's not a diary," he says of the Ford White House notes. "It is a set of working documents that I've never edited. In fact, most I've never reread." As defense secretary under President Bush, Rumsfeld issued thousands of memos; "snowflakes," they were called. He reads from some issued in 2003 and in 2005: "Are we winning or losing the War on Terror?" "Is the U.S. government changing fast enough?" "Do we need more troops? And if so, where and for what purpose?" "My brain would be going," he says. "I wanted to find out something. I needed help. I needed advice. Some of them were just, 'I need a haircut."' Another Rumsfeld Rule: "If you are not criticized, you may not be doing much." As defense secretary, he was admired as daring and innovative by foreign policy hawks and others, and was a close ally of Vice President Cheney. But he was deeply disliked by opponents of the Iraq war, and many Democrats and even some former military leaders urged his resignation. He was an architect of the Iraq conflict, whose departure was announced, just after Election Day in 2006, as the war became increasingly unpopular and Republicans lost control of Congress. Few words during his tenure stood out more than the response Rumsfeld offered in 2002 about the lack of evidence that Iraq was supplying terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. "Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because, as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know that we know," he said. "There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know we don't know." And so, with a wink, he called his book "Known and Unknown." He explains that his comments have roots in war theory, philosophy and in science. He says the idea of "known knowns" and "unknown unknowns" and so forth came up during intelligence briefings. "I used the phrase in a Pentagon press conference one day, and that's when it started rolling," Rumsfeld says. "I titled the book that because I believe people will find there are things they didn't know." He will not discuss specific contents of the book, will not comment on current events (he saves that for his Twitter account, RumsfeldOffice) and had no comment on President Bush's "Decision Points," which he said he's been too busy to read. But he says "Known and Unknown" will take on the most sensitive subjects, from the detainment facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. "I brought in people who were involved and outside advisers to discuss the legal decisions that were made. And in the book, I present them in a direct way," he says. In Washington, Rumsfeld was known as a tenacious and effective fighter of policy wars, once described by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as a "skilled full-time politician-bureaucrat in whom ambition, ability, and substance fuse seamlessly." In the 1970s, as chief of staff and then defense secretary in the Ford administration, Rumsfeld clashed with Kissinger, with Rumsfeld opposing, and helping to prevent, by many accounts, an arms control deal Kissinger had been trying to negotiate with the then Soviet Union. During the Bush administration, Rumsfeld was at odds with Secretary of State Colin Powell about Iraq. The differences were not personal, Rumsfeld says. He recalls receiving a book that Kissinger had written, with the inscription, "To an occasional adversary and a permanent friend."

When Rumsfeld began thinking about his book, "Known and Unknown," he imagined a more typical Washington release: a quick, impressionistic story based on whatever he recalled. Instead, he and a team of six aides worked four years on what became a 700-page narrative, with an additional 100-plus pages of end notes. Dozens of books were consulted and thousands of documents reviewed, from White House memos to letters Rumsfeld's parents wrote to each other during World War II. Rumsfeld's sister Joan and former Secretary of State George Shultz were among the friends, family members and colleagues who came to Washington for conversations. "I started thinking about this amazing archive I had," he says during a recent interview. "The fact that I had it, persuaded me that I ought to take advantage of it." Rumsfeld is seated in a conference room at his office suite, where the walls document a long, high-level life of politics and history: a photograph of then-Congressman Rumsfeld with President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s; a signed copy of President Gerald Ford's swearing-in statement in 1974; a piece of shrapnel from the hijacked plane that struck the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. At 78, Rumsfeld had enough energy to narrate the audio edition of the book himself – eight days of recording, eight hours a day. He looks grayer, but otherwise little changed from his time as defense secretary under President George W. Bush, with his rimless glasses and quick, confident grin. For much of his career in public office, Rumsfeld has been compiling information. As a Republican congressman from Illinois, he kept records on every vote he made and the reason for each decision. He held on to notes from presidential briefings and recorded thoughts and ideas into a Dictaphone. Rumsfeld has set up a website, (which goes live on publication day, Feb. 8), that allows visitors to link to the documents he used as source material. During his interview, Rumsfeld showed samples, including eight pages of notes from a briefing Johnson gave in 1966 on the Vietnam War and White House papers from July 1975 – when he was chief of staff under President Ford – with passages initialed by Rumsfeld's then-assistant, Dick Cheney. http://www.rumsfeld.com "It's not a journal, it's not a diary," he says of the Ford White House notes. "It is a set of working documents that I've never edited. In fact, most I've never reread." As defense secretary under Bush, Rumsfeld issued thousands of memos, "snowflakes," they were called. He reads from some issued in 2003 and in 2005: "Are we winning or losing the war on terror?" "Is the U.S. government changing fast enough?" "Do we need more troops? And if so, where and for what purpose?" "My brain would be going," he says. "I wanted to find out something. I needed help. I needed advice. Some of them were just, `I need a haircut.'" Another Rumsfeld Rule: "If you are not criticized, you may not be doing much." As defense secretary, he was admired as daring and innovative by foreign policy hawks and others, and was a close ally of Vice President Cheney. But he was deeply disliked by opponents of the Iraq war, and many Democrats and even some former military leaders called for his resignation. He was an architect of the Iraq conflict whose departure was announced, just after Election Day in 2006, as the war became increasingly unpopular and Republicans lost control of Congress. Few words during his tenure stood out more than the response Rumsfeld offered in 2002 about the lack of evidence that Iraq was supplying terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. "Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because, as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know that we know," he said. "There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know we don't know." And so, with a wink, he called his book "Known and Unknown." He explains that his comments have roots in war theory, philosophy and in science. He says the idea of "known knowns" and "unknown unknowns" and so forth came up during intelligence briefings. "I used the phrase in a Pentagon press conference one day, and that's when it started rolling," Rumsfeld says. "I titled the book that because I believe people will find there are things they didn't know." He will not discuss specific contents of the book, will not comment on current events (he saves that for his Twitter account, RumsfeldOffice) and had no comment on President Bush's "Decision Points," which he said he's been too busy to read. But he says "Known and Unknown" will take on the most sensitive subjects, from the detainment facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. "I brought in people who were involved and outside advisers to discuss the legal decisions that were made. And in the book, I present them in a direct way," he says. In Washington, Rumsfeld was known as a tenacious and effective fighter of policy wars, once described by Henry Kissinger as a "skilled full-time politician-bureaucrat in whom ambition, ability, and substance fuse seamlessly." In the 1970s, as chief of staff and then defense secretary in the Ford administration, Rumsfeld clashed with Secretary of State Kissinger, with Rumsfeld opposing – and helping to prevent, by many accounts – an arms control deal Kissinger had been trying to negotiate with the then Soviet Union. During the Bush administration, Rumsfeld was at odds with Secretary of State Colin Powell about Iraq. The differences weren't personal, Rumsfeld says. He recalls receiving a book that Kissinger had written, with the inscription, "To an occasional adversary and a permanent friend." "When I started working on the book, Kissinger said, `You tell it like it was.' We differed on some issues, and there's nothing wrong with that. It was professional and healthy," Rumsfeld says. Working on the book meant second-guessing his memory. In 1983, Rumsfeld was a special Middle East envoy for President Ronald Reagan and met with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, at the time viewed as a buffer against Iran. Some years ago, Rumsfeld was told of a magazine article saying he had personally delivered a letter from Reagan. Rumsfeld had no memory of doing so, but it turns out a State Department cable exists in which Saddam thanked Rumsfeld for the message. The letter must have come from the State Department itself, Rumsfeld says. "How could anyone believe that you couldn't remember if you delivered a letter from President Reagan to Saddam Hussein?" he says. "That's the kind of thing that persuaded me to take my time and look at the documents, since I had so many of them."
