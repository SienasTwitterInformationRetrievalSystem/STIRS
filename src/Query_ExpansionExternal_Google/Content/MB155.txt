If the Syrian government deployed them, it would mean a “red line” had been crossed, he warned. Obama’s warning that the deployment of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime would be a “game changer” came during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Wednesday. On Tuesday, both the Syrian government and rebel fighters accused each other of launching a rocket chemical warhead in Aleppo which reportedly killed 25 and injured 86. “With respect to chemical weapons, we intend to investigate thoroughly exactly what happened,” Obama said. “So I’ve instructed my teams to work closely with all other countries in the region and international organizations and institutions to find out precisely whether this red line was crossed.” Obama expressed deep skepticism regarding Syrian state media reports that “terrorists” had in fact fired the rocket, saying that the Syrian government both had the capability and had previously expressed a willingness to deploy chemical weapons “to protect themselves.” “The broader point is that once we establish the facts, I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game changer and I won’t make an announcement today about next steps because I think we have to gather the facts. But I do think that when you start seeing weapons that can cause potential devastation and mass causalities and you let that genie out of the bottle, then you are looking potentially at even more horrific scenes than we’ve already seen in Syria, and the international community has to act on that additional information,” Obama stated. The US president's comments also touched on Iran, which Washington and Tel Aviv accuse of developing a nuclear weapon. Though Washington is known to have convinced Tel Aviv behind closed doors against attacking Iran, Obama noted that he believed Netanyahu was "absolutely correct" in his belief that it was Israel's right to strike Iran as a self-defense measure. Obama added his belief that there was "not a lot of daylight" between Israeli and American intelligence on Iranian nuclear development, adding that, however, Washington still thinks "there is time to resolve this diplomatically." Referring to the option of ending its unproven nuclear weapons development program, Obama said, "The question is, will the Iranian leadership seize that opportunity." RT spoke to Jeffrey Laurenti, Senior Fellow at the Century Foundation on International Affairs, about the visit and the rhetoric on Iran. When asked if Netanyahu is ready to go it alone without the US in an attack on Iran, Laurenti said, “certainly Prime Minister Netanyahu is trying to set the marker that the United States cannot hold him back indefinitely if he feels his real security interests are at stake." But, he added, "the reality is that Israel cannot dare act on an attack against Iran and be confident of having the United States to protect it from retaliation, unless it has ... made the case why such an attack is desperate and a last resort. And that he has not been able to do with the Obama administration.” Comments (120)   Anonymous user 28.04.2013 08:55 Eastern Govts need Start Suing WestMedia. Continue propaganda journalism.

Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu hold a joint news conference in Jerusalem  Photo: REUTERS By Damien McElroy, Jon Swaine 7:53PM GMT 20 Mar 2013 Follow Speaking in Israel, Mr Obama said anyone familiar with the facts of the chemical weapons stockpile in Syria would be sceptical of pinning the blame on the opposition for a poison gas attack. “Once we establish the facts, I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game changer,” Mr Obama said. “When you start seeing weapons that can cause potential devastation and mass casualties and you let that genie out of the bottle, then you are looking at potentially even more horrific scenes than we’ve already seen in Syria.” Mr Obama said the US policy not to intervene militarily or arm Syrian rebels thus far is based on his desire to solve the problem as a global community but he reiterated that chemical weapons were a red line that would trigger intervention. The alleged use of chemical weapons has prompted senior senators from both parties in Washington to heap pressure on President Obama to intervene. Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate armed services committee, called for strikes on the Assad regime’s military facilities and for a no-fly zone to be imposed over the country.

John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two Republican senators, reiterated their long-standing demand for the US to step in, with Mr Graham even suggesting the US put “boots on the ground”. Mr Obama's comments came amid news that Britain will airlift hundreds of chemical weapons detection and protection kits to Syrian rebels as part of its first shipment of non-lethal equipment since a EU arms embargo was relaxed to allow battlefield supplies. Government sources said the equipment from Ministry of Defence stores would allow rebel fighters to detect and identify suspected chemical weapons as they battle against the regime. The shipment was being assembled as senior US politicians heaped pressure on President Barack Obama to intervene in the Syrian civil war following a poison gas attack that killed at least 25 on Tuesday. David Cameron told the House of Commons that a feeble international reaction was allowing Syria to fall into a Bosnia-style spiral of death. Bashar al-Assad speaking with Syrian women during a surprise visit in Damascus Syria’s regime and its opposition opponents have traded accusations of deploying chemical weapons in the town of Khan al-Assad, near Aleppo. Bashar al-Jafaari, Syria’s ambassador to the UN demanded a “specialised, independent and neutral mission” set-up by Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General, to investigated the incident. The rebel Syrian National Coalition has also demanded an international inquiry. British officials see the provision of chemical weapons suits, equipment that monitors the air and analysis sets as a key need for the opposition, officials said. Alongside body armour and armoured vehicles, the suits will be part of the first shipment sent within weeks via Turkey to the front line. “Protective equipment in the MoD stores is very effective for activists engaged against the regime on the ground and if it is known that kits are deployed we judge it less likely that the regime would use it,” said an official involved in the planning. “But if there are chemicals used it will allow the rebels to detect it accurately and the world to react.” Mr Cameron said the chemical weapons threat was one reason to remove the embargo on the rebels altogether. “I felt sitting round the European Council chamber there was a slight similarity between some of the arguments that were being made about not putting more weapons into Syria that seemed to me to be very familiar to the discussions we had about Bosnia and the appalling events that followed,” he said. “There should be the next ratcheting up of military effort, and that would include going after some of Syria’s air defences,” Mr Levin told Foreign Policy magazine. In an effort to show his regime’s resiliance, President Assad was pictured at a reception for a Damascus fine arts centre. King Abdullah II, the Jordanian monarch warned that President Assad’s regime was doomed and that an Islamic fundamentalist state was likely to emerge on his borders. “The most worrying factors in the Syrian conflict are the issues of chemical weapons, the steady flow or sudden surge in refugees and a jihadist state emerging out of the conflict,” the king said. The cost of the conflict already exceed half a billion dollars and were rising rapidly. An estimated 500,000 Syrian refugees – about nine per cent of Jordan’s population of 6 million, had crossed into Jordan in the last 12 months.   Syria News » World News » Middle East » Jon Swaine » Damien McElroy » In Syria   Iraq crisis in pictures   Syria presidential elections   The ruins of Aleppo   Syria chlorine gas attacks: Q & A   UN: 3.5 million Syrians desperately need aid   Read more World News Jailed Venezuelan opposition leader put on trial in Caracas   Leopoldo Lopez, the leader of the anti-government protests that rocked the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro, is charged with inciting violence after wave of unrest left 43 dead Israel-Gaza conflict: At least 15 killed in shelling of UN school   Most of those killed believed to be children, Israel Radio reports, as Gaza authorities say more than 200 wounded taken to local medical centres Israeli shelling kills at least 15 in UN Gaza shelter   Video Wounded Palestinians who were sheltering in a UN-run school in northern Gaza are rushed to hospital after being shelled by Israeli tanks Air Algerie plane 'crashes' with 116 on board after going missing over Mali: live   Air Algerie plane with 110 passengers and six crew reportedly crashes after losing contact with air traffic control over Mali after taking off from Burkina Faso to Algeria German newspaper accuses David Cameron of 'gross hypocrisy' over EU sanctions   Welt newspaper criticises the Prime Minister's government for calling for tougher sanctions against Russia's Vladimir Putin yet still continuing to supply the country with arms and giving shelter to Russian oligarchs Hillary Clinton 'blames her husband's infidelity on abuse by his mother'   Hillary Clinton reportedly said her husband's infidelities were due in part to abuse by his mother in a 1999 interview Marco Rubio and Palestinian ambassador in angry exchange over Israeli murders   Palestinian diplomat Maen Areikat accuses US Republican senator of "appalling" double standards on the murder of three Israeli teens and the slaying of a Palestinian youth Sarkozy 'Riviera postcard' risks backfiring over claims he broke driving laws   Front page shots of Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy riding a Vespa without a helmet sparks debate over whether he broke French driving laws Germany to 'spy on US and UK intelligence gathering' for the first time in 45 years   Germany orders surveillance of British and American intelligence gathering, according to reports Unless Israel lifts its blockade of Gaza, no ceasefire can work   Freedom, jobs and a future for Palestinians in Gaza are the best insurance policy Israel can have, says Chris Doyle Comments Advertisement Middle East news» Israel news Iran news Iraq news Dubai news Egypt news Advertisement Latest Video»   Three cake recipes   Opening ceremony highlights   Meet the six-year-old limbo skater   Taste test: are pyramid tea bags better?   Dancing grandpa shows off his moves   What clues will MH17 black box reveal More from the web Advertisement More from the web News Most Viewed TODAY PAST WEEK PAST MONTH Air Algerie plane 'crashes' with 116 on board after going missing over Mali: live Revealed: the Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces MH17 plane crash: Ukraine PM Arseniy Yatsenyuk resigns Israel tests hi-tech tunnel detection system to fight threat from underground City to bear brunt of EU sanctions on Russia Malaysia Airlines plane crashes on Ukraine-Russia border: July 22 as it happened Couple missed Malaysia Airlines flight that crashed because of lack of seats Revealed: the Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces Donkey suicide bomb stopped by Israeli troops in Gaza Leading HIV researchers lost as flight MH17 is downed in Ukraine Malaysia Airlines plane crashes on Ukraine-Russia border: July 22 as it happened Britain needs 'national debate' about banning Muslim girls from wearing veils in public Brazilian who turned 126 years old last week could be oldest living person Rebekah Brooks cleared but Andy Coulson guilty in phone hacking trial Dramatic near-miss at Barcelona airport Advertisement More from the web» MORE FROM TELEGRAPH.CO.UK Amazon   Infographic: Who is today’s entrepreneur?

This is a red line for the United States. I’m not going to telegraph in any specifics what we would do in the event of credible evidence that the Assad regime has resorted to using chemical weapons against his own people, but suffice to say we are certainly planning to take action if that eventuality were to occur,” Clinton said after a meeting in Prague with Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg. Prior to Clinton’s remarks, officials in the United States claimed Syria had taken preparatory steps with regard to its chemical weapons stockpile. In January, the Pentagon announced it is prepared to act in response to Syrian chemical weapons. When asked if the U.S. will take military action and secure Syria’s chemical weapons, then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said sending troops was a possibility. “You always have to keep the possibility that, if there is a peaceful transition and international organizations get involved, that they might ask for assistance in that situation. But in a hostile situation, we’re not planning to ask for that,” Panetta said. Syria recently told the United Nations it fears al-Qaeda and other extremist groups supported by the U.S. will be equipped with chemical weapons. “We have repeatedly stated publicly and through diplomatic channels that Syria will not under any circumstances use any chemical weapons that it may have, because it is defending its people from terrorists backed by well-known states, at the forefront of which is the United States of America,” said Bashar Ja’afari, the Syrian United Nations ambassador, in a letter to U.N. Boss Ban Ki-moon and the Security Council. On Tuesday, Syria accused CIA sponsored al-Qaeda rebels of using chemical weapons in a missile attack on the village of Khan al-Assal near the city of Aleppo. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said 16 people were killed and 86 wounded by the missiles reportedly containing “poisonous gases” fired from Nairab district. Bush U.N. ambassador John Bolton tells Fox News the chemical attack was launched by Syrian government. Rebels blamed the Syrian government for the deadly attack. “Why would the Free Syrian Army bomb themselves with a chemical weapon?” asked an FSA mercenary. In December, al-Qaeda mercenaries seized a military base and chemical weapons research center near Aleppo. According to reports, mustard gas and nerve agents were allegedly stored at the center. “Probably anyone from the Free Syrian Army or any Islamic extremist group could take them over,” Assad army defector, retired Maj. Gen. Adnan Silou, told the Washington Post. The attack on Tuesday arrives one day before a meeting between Obama and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Monday, we reported that during the meetings the United States and Israel will settle on a common goal – escalating the war in Syria and doubling up the effort to take out the Assad government and replace it with one more amendable to Israel and the United States. Now that chemical weapons have appeared on the scene — regardless of which side actually used them — the United States and Israel have an excuse to escalate tensions inside Syria and confront Assad’s military directly under the weapons of mass destruction pretext.

When pressed during an interview in her Tel Aviv home, Livni wouldn't say whether there is evidence that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has directed the use of any chemical weapons. But she said this development poses a direct threat to Israel, which shares a border with Syria. Livni told CNN that "the appearance is that it's not going to be only in Syria, but that Hezbollah can reach all these chemical weapons and use them against Israel in the future." Israelis have long been concerned that Hezbollah, Israel's foe in neighboring Lebanon, could gain possession of Syrian chemical weapons if the Assad regime is further destabilized. U.S. eyes 'red line' on Syria U.S. may 'act accordingly' on Syria Syria chemical weapons a 'game-changer' President Obama just landed in Israel for a two-day trip, and two national security issues dominate the agenda: the nuclear showdown with Iran and the growing crisis with Syria. On both fronts, Livni says, U.S. leadership can make the crucial difference. "The United States has the tools in order to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon and in order to stop all this situation in Syria," she said, and she insisted that this is the time to act. "It is not a favor to the state of Israel. This is something that represents the interests of the United States as well," she said. Israeli minister says she hopes U.S. helps restart peace talks In February, Israel attacked a convoy of anti-aircraft weapons in Syria. That assault did not involve chemical weapons, but clearly their use would increase the stakes for Israel. Livni says Israel is prepared to take action: "Yes, but I am not going to speak about it publicly. Israel has the right of course to defend itself." There are reports that chemical weapons were used in two locations Tuesday in Syria, killing at least 25 people. On Tuesday night, U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told CNN there was a "high probability to believe that chemical weapons were used." And in the same interview, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Diane Feinstein said "the White House has to make a decision in this. I think the days are becoming more desperate."
