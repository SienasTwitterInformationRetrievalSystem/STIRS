The security recommendations are contained in the Guide to Security for Full Virtualization Technologies (NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-125). The draft report was issued for public comment in July 2010. Virtualization adds a low-level software layer that allows multiple, even different operating systems and applications to run simultaneously on a host. "Full virtualization" provides a complete simulation of underlying computer hardware, enabling software to run without any modification. Because it helps maximize the use and flexibility of computing resources—multiple operating systems can run simultaneously on the same hardware—full virtualization is considered a key technology for cloud computing, but it introduces new issues for IT security. For cloud computing systems in particular, full virtualization can increase operational efficiency because it can optimize computer workloads and adjust the number of servers in use to match demand, thereby conserving energy and information technology resources. The guide describes security concerns associated with full virtualization technologies for server and desktop virtualization and provides recommendations for addressing these concerns. Most existing recommended security practices also apply in virtual environments and the practices described in this document build on and assume the implementation of practices described in other NIST computer security publications. The guide is intended for system administrators, security program managers, security engineers and anyone else involved in designing, deploying or maintaining full virtualization technologies. NIST SP 800-125 recommends organizations: secure all elements of a full virtualization solution and maintain their security; restrict and protect administrator access to the virtualization solution; ensure that the hypervisor, the central program that runs the virtual environment, is properly secured; and carefully plan the security for a full virtualization solution before installing, configuring and deploying it.

NIST has released a set of guidelines for addressing these risks in Special Publication 800-125, "Guide to Security for Full Virtualization Technologies.” The guidelines complement recently released drafts of NIST security guidelines for public cloud computing. The agency also has set up a new wiki, the Cloud Computing Collaboration site to enable communication among the cloud community and NIST cloud research working groups. “The recent increase in the use of full virtualization products and services has been driven by many benefits,” the guidelines say. Mounting multiple virtual machines on a single server can make more efficient use of hardware and processing capacity, and can provide desktops with access to a variety of operating systems and applications. “Desktop virtualization also supports better control of OSes to ensure that they meet the organization’s security requirements.” Related coverage: NIST guide tackles security challenges of public cloud computing But, “full virtualization has some negative security implications,” NIST warns. “Virtualization adds layers of technology, which can increase the security management burden by necessitating additional security controls. Also, combining many systems onto a single physical computer can cause a larger impact if a security compromise occurs.” « previous 1 2 3 next » E-Mail this page Printable Format Related Articles NCI builds out collaborative hub for cancer researchers07/09/2014 NIST to get new lead Internet policy advisor08/10/2010 Info sharing improves security, slows effects of brain drain05/15/2014 Cyber Grand Challenge aims to speed security automation06/04/2014 AppStore gives governments access to municipal apps06/04/2014 inside gcn ID.me trust framework extends military ID authentication Security automation: Are humans still relevant?

"With the wide availability of cloud computing services, lack of organizational controls over employees engaging such services arbitrarily can be a source of problems," NIST noted in a document prescribing a set of security and privacy guidelines for cloud computing. "Without proper governance, the organizational computing infrastructure could be transformed into a sprawling, unmanageable mix of insecure services." The issue is somewhat similar to the problems created when individual employees and small groups set up rogue wireless access points in an enterprise network, the report noted. NIST prepared the Guidelines on Security and Privacy in Public Cloud Computing in response to a directive from federal CIO Vivek Kundra. As part of his effort to accelerate the government adoption of cloud computing Kundra asked NIST to develop a set of security standards and guidelines agencies can use when moving applications and data to the cloud. The goal of the document is not to create fear among federal agencies, said Tim Grance, a computer scientist at NIST and an author of the report. Rather, the guidelines aim to prepare federal IT managers for cloud projects. "Public cloud computing is a very viable choice" for government agencies, Grance said. "We are not by any means saying 'don't do it.' But you have to be careful. You got to make sure that [cloud computing] is part of a coherent overall strategic process." NIST's 60-page document, currently open for public comment, provides a detailed analysis of many familiar cloud security and privacy issues. For instance, the report highlights multiple compliance issues, such as those related to data location, facing cloud adopters. Often, detailed information about the location of an organization's data is unavailable or not disclosed by the cloud provider, the report noted, making it hard for organizations to determine whether security controls are in place and if legal and regulatory requirements for protecting data are being met. Similarly, U.S. federal agencies are required to comply with several security and privacy related mandates, the report notes. However, the degree to which cloud providers are willing to accept liability for data under their control remains largely untested, NIST said. Organizations using public cloud computing systems relinquish direct control over many security aspects, and confer an unprecedented amount of trust in the provider. Moving to the cloud can sometimes exacerbate insider threat issues, raise questions about data ownership and control, and make risk assessment and management harder, NIST said. 1 2 Next page Comments ( ) Print Today's Top Stories Microsoft wants you to forget Windows 8 10 cool makerspaces to explore now How Microsoft's CEO sees growth for Windows Phone and Lumia 13 pieces of advice for Yosemite beta testers Changes afoot as DARPA challenge robots prep for upgrade California sees IT shifting to IBM-built cloud For half, STEM degrees lead to other jobs From CIO.com | CSOonline 14 Must-See Social Media Marketing Success Stories How to Clean Up Your IT Resume The Top 12 Fitness & Health Apps What Is Going Wrong With BYOD?

NIST Helps to Accelerate Federal Government Adoption of Cloud Computing Submitted on February 3, 2011 - 4:00pm Categories: Cloud Computing Wiki National Institute of Standards and Technology Printer-friendly version The Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued two new draft documents on cloud computing for public comment, including the first set of guidelines for managing security and privacy issues in cloud computing. The agency also has set up a new NIST Cloud Computing Collaboration website to enable two-way communication among the cloud community and the NIST cloud research working groups. Cloud computing is a way for nearly anyone or any organization with access to the Internet to rent computer power for applications and data storage from cloud providers who run large computers. Working on a cloud feels the same to users, but the cloud provider performs the many management activities required to keep computers operating and secure. U.S. Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra asked NIST to accelerate the federal government’s secure adoption of cloud computing by leading efforts to develop standards and guidelines in collaboration with standards organizations, the private sector and other stakeholders. The release of these new publications and the new website are part of NIST’s work to fulfill that mission. The publications include The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, which documents years of NIST research on cloud computing, and Guidelines on Security and Privacy in Public Cloud Computing, which provides an overview of the security and privacy challenges for public cloud computing and presents recommendations that organizations should consider when outsourcing data, applications and infrastructure to a public cloud environment. The new Cloud Computing Collaboration website, developed to foster the cloud community’s collaboration on the federal government’s secure adoption of cloud computing, provides information about NIST’s cloud computing program and invites public participation on working groups that address a wide range of cloud computing topics.
