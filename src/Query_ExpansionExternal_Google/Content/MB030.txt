Carter and Stelter wrote that Olbermann and his representatives would not deny the story and an anonymous source told them that the former MSNBC host would have an equity stake in Current TV.

He will also become the "chief news officer" for Current. Olbermann had been without a television home since he abruptly left MSNBC, where he had hosted "Countdown" for eight years, in January. For Olbermann, his move to Current gives him a chance to wield large influence over a a relatively tiny network. Current averages about 23,000 viewers in primetime every night--a far cry from the million or so viewers who watched "Countdown." In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday morning, Olbermann said that "nothing is more vital to a free America than a free media, and nothing is more vital to my concept of a free media than news that is produced independently of corporate interference." He called Current "the model truth seeking entity" in television, and said that his new show was "the most exciting event in my career." Olbermann said the show "will be for all intents and purposes an improved and we hope amplified and stronger version of the show that I just did at my previous network." He could not, however, provide details of the name and time of the show, saying only, "stay tuned." Al Gore, the chairman of Current TV, also spoke on the conference call. He said he was "extremely honored and delighted" that Olbermann was coming to Current. He said Olbermann was a "great fit with Current in every way." Olbermann will also be the executive producer of the new show. In the conference call, he called Current the only "independent news and information" channel in the United States. He said he was looking forward to working somewhere where "purely market forces are not the deciding factor in what we're doing here." A reporter asked if Olbermann would be able to donate to political candidates in his new position-- a reference to the suspension Olbermann received at MSNBC for his donations to three Democrats. "The answer is yes," Gore said. "We believe at Current that every citizen has freedom of speech, and that freedom of speech includes the ability to donate to candidates of your choice." He added that "full disclosure of that is important." As Chief News Officer, Current CEO Mark Rosenthal said, Olbermann will be intimately involved with all of the channel's news and informational programming. Current has already launched a website for Olbermann's upcoming show.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe News Media Keith Olbermann's Current Event: New Show, New Job at Al Gore's Channel By James Poniewozik @poniewozik Feb. 08, 2011 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Delicious Google+ Comment Follow @TIMECulture Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann announced this morning that, as of late spring, he will launch a new primetime show and become Chief News Officer at Current TV. [Pause to allow readers to find Current TV in their digital-cable/satellite channel guides.] On a conference call with Current founders former Vice President Al Gore and Joel Hyatt, Olbermann said that his new show, much like Countdown at MSNBC, would focus on “calling people out” and offering his take on the news—”an improved and we hope amplified and stronger version” of the show he left abruptly after working out a severance agreement with MSNBC last month. Gore and Hyatt said that the nonfiction network—much hyped at its launch, little-watched since—welcomed the chance to give Olbermann a voice; Olbermann, meanwhile, said that working for (and helping to run) a much smaller network would grant him an independence missing in corporate-owned media. In other words, Current and Olbermann each have something the other needs. Or at least they hope they do. Olbermann had a Conan O’Brien problem. He had a name and a following, but–despite the thousand-channel universe–there were only a few existing platforms for what he did, and they were all full. Once Fox washed out as an opportunity for O’Brien, the likes of TBS were all that was left on TV. Likewise, while it may seem like we have far more cable news talk shows than we need, there are three 24-hour channels (four with HLN), and the ones who hadn’t already fired him had full primetimes. So Olbermann made a move like Conan, and maybe even analogous to Oprah Winfrey: not jumping to a big network, but a small one that could, to some extent, become his own vehicle. If this move works out (and if the others do), this could augur an era in which more cable channels, especially smaller ones, essentially become virtual brand extensions of single celebrity talents. In an executive role, Olbermann could help reshape Current’s lineup with other compatible (and maybe like-minded) hosts, just as he helped to get Rachel Maddow started at MSNBC. At the conference, Current’s team stressed that Olbermann was instrumental in branding ESPN and MSNBC (the former one maybe more of a stretch, as many hands made SportsCenter). And while we don’t know yet what Olbermann will do, his brand pretty much immediately subsumes Current’s—and in a way even Gore’s, since the Vice President has not been an on-air regular at the network. Is it the right move for Olbermann? Uh, sure. Why not? What else was he going to do? The upside is, he gets to make a network in his own image, one that could become a player in the national media and political conversation. The downside—well, it’s not like the bar for ratings success is so high at Current to begin with. (Current averages 23,000 viewers in prime time. Even when getting beat out by Fox News, Olbermann had that many viewers under his couch cushions.) There are so many ways this story could go: he could be Conan at TBS, or Howard Stern on satellite—or Dan Rather on HDNet. But almost by default he at least improves the channel’s ratings, and he can always move on. Does the news transform Current instantly into a major cable channel? No, but it does transform Current into a minor cable channel, which is an improvement. While it got a lot of attention when Al Gore founded the idealistic, user-generated-news-oriented channel in 2005, its ratings and profile since have been infinitesimal. There was much talk that Gore might try to make Current a political-news channel—a TV Air America or a liberal answer to Fox News. Instead, it was an earnest, quirky video and documentary channel, with a mix of investigative world reporting, user-made videos and today, hunting-dining show Kill It, Cook It, Eat It. It was well-intended, sometimes interesting, rarely noticed. Now it will be a channel that gets talked about, for a while anyway, though Olbermann is not guaranteed to make it into a top-, or even mid-, tier cable channel (any more than Don Imus did when he simulcasted on RFD network). If this does work, it will be because Olbermann does what Gore could not, or would not, do then: become intensely, personally involved and give the channel a distinct point of view and a celebrity stamp. On the conference call, Gore sidestepped a question about whether Olbermann’s hire (he also gets an equity stake on top of his managerial title) will turn Current into a “liberal” network: “I find myself in substantial agreement with the views that I’ve heard Keith Olbermann express, and I think the conversation of democracy in the US benefits greatly from having Keith heard.” We did get clarity on whether Olbermann will be allowed to donate to political candidates, which got him in trouble at MSNBC: yes—”Freedom of speech includes the ability to donate to candidates of your choice,” Gore said—but he’ll also need to disclose. (It helps that Olbermann will essentially be his own boss.) But if Current is to develop a revitalized media brand, whatever it is, it will need to expand the rest of its programming to complement its new star. And Olbermann, as the news chief, will need to rebuild a network more literally than he did at MSNBC. What may matter more to the success of this arrangement is not whether it brings fans the same old Keith Olbermann, but how effectively it creates a brand-new Current TV. 0 comments   Get Livefyre FAQ Sign in + Follow Post comment   Link Sort: Newest | Oldest Latest from our Partners 'Forgotten': Foster Baby Dies in Hot Car in Wichita — NBC News Do Yourself A Favor And Watch This Kitten Attack A Ceramic Cat — Huffington Post Food Fight: Russia Wants to Ban Some McDonald's Meals — NBC News No Regrets: Birthright Continues to Send Thousands to Israel — NBC News Uruguay eliminates Italy; Did Suarez bite again? — Sports Illustrated Gwen Stefani Nurses Her Son in Switzerland, Shares Photo — People SubscribePopular Among Subscribers Japan's Booming Sex Niche: Elder Porn Young Kids, Old Bodies Benedict Cumberbatch Talks Secrets, Leaks, and Sherlock Obama's Trauma Team Get all access to digital and print Subscribe Most Popular From Entertainment All-TIME 100 Novels Top 10 of Everything: Arts and Entertainment Here’s How the Animators Made The Lego Movie: Watch A Year in Tears: 13 Weep-Worthy Movies of 2013 The 25 Best Songs of 2013 (So Far) From Time.com Russian Forces Double Along Ukraine Border Gangs of ‘Powerfully Built’ Women Are Mugging Tourists on the Streets of Hong Kong Putin Phones Obama To Discuss Ukraine, White House Says Colbert Tweet Draws Accusations of Racism and #CancelColbert There’s A Scientific Reason for Why You Look Weird In Selfies More on TIME #LightBoxFF: Along For the Ride With Lauren DeCicca and Andre Malerba Inside Bangladesh’s Cheap Cigarette Factories The 13 Most Influential Candy Bars Ever 17 Memorable Kisses Throughout History Connect With TIME ' } else { s += ' ' } s += '' + google_ads[i].line1 + ' '; s += ''; s += google_ads[i].line2 + ' ' + google_ads[i].line3 + ' '; s += ''; s += '' + google_ads[i].visible_url + ''; s += ' Sponsored Links' + s + ' ﻿ Home U.S. Politics World Business Tech Health Science Entertainment Newsfeed Living Opinion Sports Magazine Subscribe Give a Gift Newsletters Customer Service Site Map Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Use Ad Choices/Logo © 2014 Time Inc.

Jumping into the fray is Rush Limbaugh who discussed the announcement on his radio show this morning. He suggested that, “in normal circumstances,” Olbermann would have publicists hide this move, hoping that “nobody ever heard about it” implying just how much the talk radio giant thinks of Al Gore’s television network. But, since that’s not going to happen, Limbaugh suggested that everyone else should stop talking about it instead. “I just have one piece of advice for the people at Fox; do not ever talk about what goes on over there and nobody will ever hear about it. Olbermann wouldn’t be anything today if they hadn’t decided to start picking fights with people over there. That network wouldn’t have half the audience its got as it does now.” In his typical blowhardian way, Limbaugh does have a point. All of the talk of Olbermann’s move is the most that many people have ever probably heard of Current TV. Still, Olbermann’s troubles recently with MSNBC have only proven just how devoted his fan base is which means chances are good that they won’t need reminders from Bill O’Reilly to watch his stuff. Still, it will be interesting to see if Limbaugh takes his own advice. Our guess is that the second Olbermann returns in front of television cameras, Limbaugh will be one of the first to register a (lets go out on a limb and say “negative”) review.
