2012, shows bees in a hive, placed in front of apartment buildings, in Saint-Martin-d'Hères, French Alps. JEAN-PIERRE CLATOT/AFP/GettyImages Honeybee deaths are on the rise across the world, and researchers are working to find the cause. With as many as 40 or 50 percent of commercial U.S. bee hives lost to colony collapse disorder, according to the New York Times, scientists are eyeing a relatively new class of pesticides as a likely culprit. Neonicotinoids, which are chemically similar to nicotine, have already been shown to interfere with bees' capacity to learn scents, hampering their efforts to collect food. Colony collapse disorder -- which follows a "sudden loss of a colony’s worker bee population," according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- may be relatively new. It first surfaced around 2005, the New York Times explains, but has gotten dramatically worse in the past year. The European Commission has been pushing for a neonicotinoid pesticide ban in the EU, but chemical companies have been protesting. Syngenta and Bayer, two of the top producers of the pesticides, recently proposed a plan to expand bee habitats and increase monitoring in an attempt avoid restrictions on their products. In the U.S., a group of environmentalists and beekeepers recently filed suit against the EPA for approving the pesticides. Neonicotinoids, they wrote in the lawsuit, have been "repeatedly identified as highly toxic to honeybees, clear causes of major bee kills and significant contributors to the devastating ongoing mortality of bees known as colony collapse disorder,” reported Bloomberg. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to issue its own assessment later in the spring, according to the New York Times. A recent study published by the American Bird Conservancy found that the pesticides may also negatively impact birds and water-borne insects. Mother Jones notes the report hasn't been peer-reviewed, but was authored by a retired senior research scientist formerly with Canada's environment ministry.

Honeybees are probably the most economically valuable insects in the world, and are responsible for pollinating most of the food we eat. Here in the United States there’s an entire industry built up behind honeybees, with most US honeybees being transported to California to pollinate almonds at some point in the year. Unfortunately there are a lot of wrong-headed things out there in the press. One common idea I see spread through facebook meme, such as the image to the left, is that biotech crops are responsible for killing the bees. This is a hypothesis that’s been pretty thoroughly researched in a variety of ways. Industry data very strongly indicates this is not the case: a recent meta analysis performed by Monsanto published in PLOS ONE reviewed experiments done by a wide variety of researchers and concluded that there were no effects on survival of bees on Bt crops. Academic research is consistent with the industry data, from a 2005 review on the nontarget effects of Bt crops in the Annual Review of Entomology: Neither Bt cotton nor Bt maize requires bees for pollination, but cotton nectar is attractive to them and produces a useful honey. Maize pollen may be collected when other pollen sources are scarce. Pre-release honey bee biosafety tests have been conducted for each Bt crop registered in the United States, including Cry9C maize and Cry3A potatoes. Each test involved feeding bee larvae and sometimes adults with purified Cry proteins in sucrose solutions at concentrations that greatly exceeded those recorded from the pollen or nectar of the GM plants in question. In each case, no effects were observed. The rationale for requiring larval and not adult bee tests is questionable, because adult bees ingest considerable quantities of pollen in their first few days post emergence. Larvae, particularly later instars, also consume pollen along with jelly secreted by nurse adult bees, but only recently have there been attempts to quantify pollen ingestion by individual larvae. Other studies with bees fed purified Bt proteins, or pollen from Bt plants, or bees allowed to forage on Bt plants in the field have confirmed the lack of effects noted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Post-release monitoring programs are now underway to assess impacts of North American GM crops on pollinators under commercial field conditions. Admittedly, there could be better data on this subject. For instance some of the research that’s been done has been done without some essential controls, like this German group which fed honeybee larvae a mixture of Bt pollen without determining that active Bt proteins were present in the pollen. The data, however, is generally against the idea that Bt crops harm bees. What isn’t harming the bees? Other groups have suggested neonicotinoids, but the problem with this is that we don’t have a a lot of the neccessary data we’d need to know for sure if this is the case. We’ve discussed this in the Biofortified comments before. The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation put out a very detailed report on the subject, which concluded: The failure of foraging bees to return to their hives has led many people to suggest that a link exists between CCD and the behavioral disruptions observed with sublethal exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides. As of yet, no single insecticide or combination of insecticides have been linked to CCD, though many chemicals have been found in hives. Researchers that compared gene expression in honey bees from healthy colonies and from collapsed colonies found no link between expression of genes that code for proteins associated with the detoxification of insecticides and collapsed colonies. This suggests that insecticide exposure, whether to neonicotinoids or another class, is not a primary factor in CCD…. …While neonicotinoids and other agrochemicals do not appear to be the direct cause of CCD, they may be a contributing factor to already stressed colonies. It is increasingly important that future studies focus on interactions of multiple factors suspected of contributing to CCD. My favorite TV show, Doctor Who even jumped in on the commotion by claiming that the bees had returned home to an alien planet: There aren’t a lot of easy answers on the topic, and pesticides are probably one of the better ideas being tossed around in the popular media. There are some good reasons to think that some pesticides, especially neonicotinoids, may be a big contributing factor. However, the losses began well after crops expressing Bt proteins were adopted and a very long time after neonicotinoids were adopted so these have never struck me as likely cuplrits. While the Doctor Who episode featured the disappearance as a mostly tongue-in-cheek thing, religious fanatics have suggested that this was a sign of the apocalypse. Cellphones have also been another popular crackpot theory.  So it’s unlikely that these are factors in colony collapse. Personally, I wish I could say definitively that GMOs or neonicotinoids were responsible for Colony Collapse Disorder because then I could say that we knew why the bees are disappearing. Instead, there are a lot more factors to consider. While it would be a simple task to fill Biofortified with an unfruitful discussion of what colony collapse isn’t, I think it would be a much better idea to discuss what colony collapse disorder is, talk about some of the factors involved in the decline of honeybees, and engage in follow-up discussions in the comments. I’m going to break this article into 5 sections: History of Beekeeping Honeybee Biology and Apid Ecology Parasites Pathogens and Pesticides Nutrition The Big Picture While I’d like to discuss each in detail, the list is going to be very incomplete. For each section, I’m going to give a snapshot: I just want readers to be aware that this is a huge area of research. History of Beekeeping Earler, I said that I didn’t think Bt crops or neonicotinoid insecticides were direct causes because they were relatively new things. There are reasons for this. The first thing you need to realize when reading up on this subject is that we’ve been keeping bees for awhile. About 15,000 years ago, some enterprising caveman discovered that bees stockpiled delicious honey and we began braving sheer cliffs and angry insects to collect this honey. Awhile later, another enterprising individual discovered that you could build boxes to keep bees in and by about 5,000 years ago the very basic foundations of modern beekeeping were laid out. If one of those ancient beekeepers were kidnapped by The Doctor and transported to a modern apairy, they probably wouldn’t be completely lost. The materials have changed, but the methods of beekeeping haven’t really changed all that much. For as long as we’ve been keeping good records, we’ve recorded losses. One of the articles announcing the Colony Collapse problem appeared in PLOS Biology in 2007, and described these ancient losses in quite a bit of detail: Some winter losses are normal, and because the proportion of colonies dying varies enormously from year to year, it is difficult to say when a crisis is occurring and when losses are part of the normal continuum. What is clear is that about one year in ten, apiarists suffer unusually heavy colony losses. This has been going on for a long time. In Ireland, there was a “great mortality of bees” in 950, and again in 992 and 1443. One of the most famous events was in the spring of 1906, when most beekeepers on the Isle of Wight (United Kingdom) lost all of their colonies. American beekeepers also suffer heavy losses periodically. In 1903, in the Cache valley of Utah, 2000 colonies were lost to a mysterious “disappearing disease” following a “hard winter and cold spring”. More recently, there was an incident in 1995 in which Pennsylvania beekeepers lost 53% of colonies. Often terms such as “disappearing disease” or “spring dwindling” are used to describe the syndrome in which large numbers of colonies die in spring due to a lack of adult bees. However in 2007, some beekeepers experienced 80–100% losses. This is certainly the extreme end of a continuum, so perhaps there is indeed some new factor in play. Furthermore, the original USDA action plan reviews some other serious threats to beekeeping that happened at the same time. While worrying is a legitimate reaction, I’m not entirely convinced that this is a new phenomenon. It’s entirely possible that similar things have happened before. However, there are a few more confounding factors which prevent us from being able to say that the same problems are coming around again. There are new things around, like neonicotinoids and pyrethroids (specifically fluvalinate) which weren’t around then and could be contributing today. There are also other new things, like a shrinking environment, constant travel and increased global spread of disease organisms, which are probably contributing factors. However, given the fact that similar things have happened in the past it’s unlikely that we’re dealing with a completely new phenomenon. Honeybee Biology and Apid Ecology Honeybees aren’t your average insect, and there are many quirks of their biology that make them unusual if you compare them to more common livestock like sheep or pigs. A lot of these factors make them more susceptible to parasites and pathogens. Honeybees are weird in that they’re difficult to think of as a collection of multiple organisms, but in my opinion, are more accurately described as a superorganism. Superorganisms are a collection of entities that function as a single organism. While honeybee colonies consist of thousands of individuals, the colony functions as a single creature. Honeybees are very highly evolved eusocial organisms with a strict division of labor, both in terms of reproduction and everyday nest maintenance. Unlike humans and ants, honeybees need more than a male and a female to found a nest. The colony begins when a drone mates with a virgin queen, and after she returns a big chunk of the colony splits off to form a new colony. The queen is incapable of raising larvae by herself, and if you were to put a mated queen in a beehive there would be no colony. Instead, she needs workers to build wax combs in which to lay her eggs. These workers have their own division of labor based on age: young workers clean the nest and tend the young, middle age workers  forage and older workers forage and defend the colony. To reproduce, the bees need all these groups. They need drones and queens to reproduce, and the workers to do the work. Without all of these working in unison, there is no bee colony. These social roles are very important, and a large part of honeybee immunity revolves around social roles. Bees keep the colonies quite clean, and even work together to seal the hive from invaders with propolis. Besides sealing the colony, propolis also has antimicrobial properties. It’s not the cure for cancer, but it likely stops the spread of bacteria and viruses.  While bees within colonies tend to stick to themselves, there are circumstances where stranded workers may enter another hive… especially if their home colony is suddenly transported out of foraging range. During later times of the year, stronger colonies may raid weaker colonies. With this in mind, the 2007 USDA action plan defines CCD thusly: Symptoms of CCD include: (i) sudden loss of the colony’s adult bee population with very few bees found near the dead colonies; (ii) several frames with healthy, capped brood with low levels of parasitic mites, indicating that colonies were relatively strong shortly before the loss of adult bees and that the losses cannot be attributed to a recent infestation of mites; (iii) food reserves that have not been robbed, despite active colonies in the same area, suggesting avoidance of the dead colony by other bees; (iv) minimal evidence of wax moth or small hive beetle damage; and (v) a laying queen often present with a small cluster of newly emerged attendants We’ll discuss those parasites later. **One problem that I see consistently in online discussions of Colony Collapse Disorder is that many assume that any loss of bee colonies is the same thing as CCD. There are many reasons a honeybee colony can die, and the definition of CCD above eliminates some of the other possibilities. For example, under the second symptom (ii) there must be low levels of Varroa mites which means that the colonies aren’t killed by Varroa mites. Later definitions also remove colonies with damaging levels of Nosema. Pesticide poisoning also results in large numbers of dead bees around the hive, so direct pesticide poisoning does not match up with these symptoms. While it’s tempting to assume that these symptoms are explained by only the older workers being afflicted, I would caution against that interpretation because it can be explained equally well by a slow-acting agent acquired as larvae that finally kills the bees well after they’ve emerged as adults. The fact that only newly emerged adult bees are still present means that newly emerged adult bees are still present. The other thing that you need to realize is that we get a lot of pollination services from native bees, and those native bees  we rely on for pollination are in trouble as well. In fact invertebrates as a group aren’t doing too well, but bees seem to be particularly hard hit. Ecosystem fragmentation and loss of plant diversity are definitely major contributors, but cross-contamination of pathogens between native and our introduced honeybees is probably a contributing factor. In other words, we’re losing vital pollinators on two fronts, and it’s too early to know for sure if the two events are related. Parasites, Pathogens and Pesticides Some of these guys we’ve already mentioned, but have yet to discuss in detail. Honeybees, like virtually every other organism on the planet, have their own set of parasites and pathogens which can wreak havoc on bee colonies. Some will immunosuppress the adults, others weaken the entire colony, while others target larvae. The list of pathogens is quite long, and some are bigger problems in some parts of the world and in some parts of the country. I could easily devote an entire post to their biology, but here are just four along with the problems they cause: Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) is a virus which infects honeybees, and is spread among the workers in a colony. Under certain circumstances, which I’ll describe later, the virus can replicate out of control and cause damage in honeybee colonies. The damage results from lots of honeybees having deformed body parts, and stunted wings. A good chunk of these bees die after soon after they emerge. Nosema are single celled fungal parasites. They inject their cell’s cytoplasm into the intestinal cell of the bee and replicate rapidly. The parasite is spread through the feces, and often you can tell if a colony has a Nosema infection by looking for larger than normal amounts of feces around the outside of the hive. Infected bees are puffy and white, and have trouble absorbing nutrients from their food. Infected bees are quite easy to tell apart from noninfected bees. Paralytic viruses is a broad category that includes several different viruses, among them Acute Paralysis Virus and Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus. These viruses do pretty much exactly what it sounds like, they slowly render the bee immobile and unable to fly. The role of these viruses is controversial because some research indicates that they’re involved, while other groups downplay their role. Varroa destructor is a parasitic mite that’s closely related to ticks. They attach to the outside of honeybee adults and larvae and suck their hemolymph, knocking their immune system out to facilitate this process. V. destructor also vectors viral pathogens. The damage from V. destructor infestation is both from transmission of disease and from removal of hemolymph. These are just four pathogens that are major problems in honeybees, but they’re not neccessarily culprits in the Colony Collapse problem. There are also insects that play a role in weakening honeybee colonies. Hive beetles will burrow through honeycomb, consuming pollen and bee larvae. Waxworms are caterpillar larvae which burrow through frames of beeswax that are in storage. While these organisms generally steer clear of hives implicated in CCD, it’s possible they could still play a role by tracking pathogens into colonies. Bees fight these pathogens off in three ways. First, as already mentioned, they line most of their colonies with propolis which has antimicrobial properties. Second, they practice a form of socialized medicine where they will expel diseased larvae and adults from the colony. They can also practice a so-called ‘behavioral fever’ where the bees vibrate their bodies to overheat intruders. Some bees have also learned to use this against predators, as shown in the video at the bottom of this section. A third form of defense is the bee’s immune system. They have a full compliment of weapons at their disposal, from antibiotic proteins that form holes in bacterial cells and blow them up, to RNAinterference that destroys nucleic acide sequences of viruses, to hemocytes that encapsulate invaders. However, they tend to rely more on sanitation than their immune system. One thing worth mentioning isn’t what they have, but what they lack. The husbandry of other livestock has certainly benefited from the fact that they can be used as models for humans, but bees aren’t so lucky. Honeybees are insects, and insects lack an antibody production system. Because they don’t produce antibodies, they can’t be vaccinated*. Bees are exposed to quite a few pesticides, believe it or not. These not only include pesticides that they’re exposed to while foraging (i.e. those neionicotinoids), but also pesticides that they’re exposed to in order to combat V. destructor. There are sophisticated sampling methods to sample for V. destructor and there are damage thresholds that have been set. Thus, V. destructor can be managed in an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) setting. Fluvalinate is a synthetic pyrethroid that’s more toxic to mites than to bees, and this is used to control V. destructor in bee colonies. Organophosphate insecticides, namely Coumaphos, are used when pyrethroid insecticides fail because of resistance. When frames are stored, waxworms are sometimes controlled with napthalene, the active ingredient in mothballs. Nutrition and Stress A lot of people imagine aparies as places that are surrounded by miles of quiet little meadows like what you see on TV, but sadly this is not the case. Honeybees are likely impacted by the fragmentation of habitat just like native bees, and their diets are often supplemented by nectar substitutes like high fructose corn syrup. While high sugar diets in humans contribute to obesity by increasing calories, the diets of bees consist largely of sugary liquids like nectar. The problem is that wild nectar contains lots of sugar in addition to other things like amino acids that are lacking in HFCS, and other substitutes aren’t economically viable. Furthermore, bees are exposed to a lot of variable conditions when they travel. They need a high diversity of pollen because pollen can vary widely in it’s nutritional composition. When the honeybees are loaded onto trucks and transported cross-country it’s questionable whether they’d be exposed to the types of pollen that are, nutritionally speaking, best for them.These would presumably be in protein rich pollen substitutes, but I’m unaware of any studies that have evaluated whether these will nourish well enough to support an immune response. The Big Picture Pathogens, pesticides and all the other factors I mentioned above do not exist in a vacuum. Instead, everything interacts with everything else. Pathogens co-infect bees in the field and a lot of the research that’s underway is aimed at looking at the bee pathogens which are correlated with Colony Collapse. Unfortunately, there are no pathogens which are correlated with Colony Collapse. There are no pesticides which are exclusively connected with Colony Collapse, either. There are also no genes which are consistently upregulated in Colony Collapse colonies. Instead, it looks like there are a bunch of smaller incidents which involve a lot of factors acting in unison. The reason why there’s a lot of focus on diseases in CCD research is because CCD bees tend to have higher numbers of bee pathogens, and lots of different pathogens. The problem, however, is that there are no diseases that are exclusively associated with CCD. Furthermore, a lot of the pathogens that are in healthy colonies are also found in CCD colonies. Researchers are just starting to understand these interactions. A recent PLOS ONE paper shows how complicated these interactions can be. In the figure below, the circles represent different pathogens, and the black lines represent correlations. The bigger the circle, the greater the proportion of bees in the colonies that are infected. The thicker the lines, the stronger the correlations between pathogens. Some pathogens, like Nosema apis (N. apis), Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV), and Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV) are detected more commonly in collapsing colonies which is denoted by the size of the circles. In collapsing colonies, how often different pairs of pathogens are detected in the colonies are shown by the thickness of the lines. Unfortunately, at this time, we’re not sure whether these pathogens are causing the collapse of the colonies or if they’re there because the colonies are collapsing. All of these pathogens have been shown to be able to kill bee colonies, but whether they’re actually killing the colonies is hard to determine. There are instances where some of these pathogens, like Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) can be present but not cause symptoms and there are conditions which cause the same pathogens to become very problematic. One such interaction is between Varroa destructor and DWV. To ensure a meal, the mites have to immunosuppress their hosts. In other animals, this often creates openings that allow other pathogens to establish. Nazzi et. al 2012 did a pretty good series of tests looking at how infestation of V. destructor changes infection by Deformed Wing Virus. They found that by artificially infesting bees infected with DWV with V. destructor, they could get the number of DWV genome copies to increase by quite a bit. Then, they looked at expression of an immune factor connected to the NF-KB pathway, Dorsal, as a product of viral infection and found that only viral infection but not mite feeding caused a decrease in the production of RNA that codes for this protein. Artificial silencing of Dorsal resulted in an increase of DWV reproduction. As more mites feed on the bees, the more susceptible the bees become to DWV. Because the viruses are able to replicate easier, they’re able to better drive down the transcription of factors that play a role in defense against viruses. The results from their study pretty strongly imply that feeding of the mites causes a loop that results in DWV replicating out of control, and higher levels of DWV cause the bees to die at a faster rate. Because some factors involved in antiviral immunity are downregulated, it also implies that bees that are both infested with V. destructor and infected with DWV are more susceptible to infection by other pathogens. The V. destructor-DWV interaction is worth mentioning, not because it’s important for CCD but because it describes the type of research that needs to be done. V. destructor is frequently sampled for and relatively easy to detect, which means that this parasite is easily controlled. Similar interactions between honeybee pathogens may go undetected, and V. destructor is present at some level in most colonies. While V. destructor may be absent from collapsing colonies, the diseases it vectors are still present and we don’t understand how these diseases interact. Finally, not all honeybee diseases are well studied. There are some organisms, notably Malpighamobea mellificae, which cause diseases in honeybees but haven’t been studied since the 1960s. M. mellificae replicates in the bee’s Malpighian tubules (kind of like their kidneys) and keep these from functioning properly. They can cause problems in beehives, especially around springtime when the bees are recovering from hard winters. The infected bees get a form of dysentary, and often flee the colony in a manner similar to Collapsing hives. Since there’s no research on the pathogen, it’s unclear if this pathogen plays any role in Colony Collapse (Evans and Schwarz, 2011). Conclusions There are a lot of factors involved in colony collapse disorder, and it’s unlikely that there is ‘One True Cause of Colony Collapse’. There are a lot of things that correlate with the symptoms and timelines, but we have to start to separate these. Above, I’ve shown a lot of things that correlate with collapsing colonies… but at the same time, so did my high-school graduation. A correlation can shed light on some details of the problem, but this isn’t the same thing as causation. We know that similar incidents have happened before, but they were a lot more localized than the current set of events. Pesticides, pathogens and environmental factors are likely to be involved but we’ve really got no idea what role these factors play at the current time. There’s good progress being made, but it’s still too early to know why it’s happening this time around. While we might not know exactly why honeybee colonies are dying, there are a lot of good entomologists trying to figure out what factors are involved in Colony Collapse. The stuff I’ve described above is merely a snapshot of a small subset of interactions which entomologists have to dig through to get to the heart of the problem. Throughout this entire piece, I’ve tried to stick to open-access literature so interested readers can have access to good information on this stuff. If you’re interested in further reading, there are a variety of institutions which have good information. The Xerces Society does a lot of great work on studying the native bees. The USDA has a great webpage on Colony Collapse Disorder and puts out annual open-access reports on what progress has been made on CCD over the past few years. . * The use of the term ‘vaccination’ is controversial within insect immunology because some (including myself) think it implies antibody production. Instead of producing antibodies, insects rely on proteins that detect broad classes of pathogens. They can modify how specific and sensitive their immune response is by upregulating certian components these after exposure, and in some cases ‘store’ bits of double-stranded RNA. There’s research ongoing to determine if exposure to bits of pathogen could be used as a prophylactic measure in the way we use vaccines. **This paragraph was added by edit on 3/14/2013 after my first comment below.

There are a couple of pieces of CCD information that I’ve struggled to find in recent years and wondered if you could recommend any papers/resources/reports that could provide answers. 1- Is there a record of annual reported CCD losses around the world? It’s difficult to know whether it is still an increasing problem or if incidences have levelled/reduced since 2006. 2- Is there a resource that shows which regions around the globe have been affected by CCD? It’s surprisingly hard to find this information. Most websites focus on the US. Thanks in advance if you could help a layman like myself further understand this complex and interesting area. Graham White March 13, 2013 at 9:51 am · Reply Unfortunately, despite the enormous effort you have put into this, you are sadly wrong. I suggest you read the Buglife Report here: http://www.buglife.org.uk/Resources/Buglife/revised%20neonics%20report.pdf “The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on bumblebees, Honey bees and other non- target invertebrates (revised version) Vicky Kindemba 2009 ” This is a meta-analysis of over 50 peer reviewed studies going back as far as 2000AD , when the French Government banned neonicotinoids on sunflowers, oilseed rape and maize – after 1,000,000 French bee colonies were lost, following the introduction of Bayer’s imidacloprid based systemic pesticide ‘Gaucho’ on sunflowers. Buglife also issued an updated review, which classified more than 50 peer reviewed papers into one of three classes: 1. The study assigned neonics the major role in colony collapse 2. The study concluded neonics played no role in CCD 3. The study came to no conclusion either way. Six papers fell into category 3. (we just don’t know) Two papers (4%) fell into category 2 (neonics are innocent) Forty four papers (96%) fell into category 1 (neonics cause the global pandemic of bee deaths) Guess which two papers were funded by the pesticide industry? Guess which 44 papers were funded by governments or independent sources? If you send me an email I will gladly send you the key studies/ I write as a beekeeper of 18 years experience who has just lost 80% of my colonies during this current winter – and it was not down to varroa or viruses. I live in an area of intense oilseed rape cultivation where the entire landscape for 20 miles radius is dominated by neonic treated OSR/ Bill Price March 14, 2013 at 12:26 am · Reply Graham , sorry to hear of your loss. That is a devistating feeling. My bees died this winter as well, but it was definitely not CCD. Can you definitely attribute your loss to CCD? We’re all the bees gone? Did you observe dead bees? Larvae? Dead hives != CCD, but the association is often made. Also, explain low CCD rates in Austrailia, which regularly uses neonics. Likewise, explain CCD in France, which has banned neonic use for many years (longer than the typical half life). BTW, the commercial beeks here often seek out canola and rape seed fields for their hives (yes, the fields/seeds are treated). They have no problems out of the ordinary. Andre March 15, 2013 at 2:50 pm · Reply The primary question actually is: « What is the link between winter loss and CCD »? I understand that, in France, neonics were named as culprits for the sudden disappearance of forager bees. Joe Ballenger March 15, 2013 at 5:55 pm · Reply Andre, That gets to the heart of the issue that I’d like to address with this post. Bees die during winter for a number of reasons. Varroa/DWV and Nosema are big reasons. Sometimes the ventilation’s not good in the overwintering building, and the bees die from CO2 buildup. Stuff like this accounts for about 2/3rds of losses of US bee colonies. Colony Collapse Disorder is a very specific syndrome, whose symptoms are listed above. This accounts for about the other third. There have been researchers who have looked at the pesticides found in bee colonies diagnosed with CCD, as well as expression of detoxification genes in bees from colonies diagnosed with CCD. Neither of these revealed any correlations with pesticides. Now the problem is that European bee colonies are in trouble as well, and these trends have continued in areas that have banned neonics. Only recently have European researchers started to standardize case definitions with the American CCD case definition (see link above). So, that still leaves us on Square One. Neonics have troubling sublethal effects which could affect honeybee health, and they seem to interact with some parasites. But, we don’t know the full extent of these effects. The big problem with Neonics in Europe is that they were worse for bees than preliminary research indicated. Folks are trying to figure out exactly how much worse they were. Native bee losses are another monster, as there are a lot of factors that are different between honeybees. Diet, pesticide exposure, stress…all of these would be very different in important ways. I’m really trying to avoid link-dumping here, so I’m limiting myself to one or two papers per reply. Here are the papers cited in the Xerces report for pesticides and gene expression, with some comments. Immune and pesticide toxicity gene expression: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/08/21/0906970106.abstract When this paper was published, it was very controversial because it was published in a high profile journal and didn’t demonstrate any clear patterns in expression of pesticide detox or immune related genes. One problem, however, is that it used microarrays which have some issues associated with them. At the time, this was top-of-the line methodology…but I personally think it needs to be replicated with RNA-Seq. This paper will give you an idea of how complex the pesticide situation is in honeybee colonies: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009754 There are a *lot* of pesticides…literally dozens…found in appreciable concentrations inside honeybee colonies. There are learning defects that have been documented in non-neonic pesticides, and there’s all sorts of synergism that can happen between different pesticide classes. It’s going to be a lot of work to tease this all out, and neonics are only a tiny part of this story. the bug guy March 14, 2013 at 6:07 am · Reply While the Buglife report correctly shows the high risks neonics present to bees, they do not show a conclusive link to CCD. Considering how sensitive honeybees are to many other pesticides, you could probably draw up a similar document for other classes. Joe Ballenger March 14, 2013 at 11:51 am · Reply Jonathan, I’ve been following the CCD data through the USDA reports over the past few years, and these focus mostly on American hives. In Europe, there have been a lot of unexplained bee deaths but only recently have some of these incidents been attributed to CCD. As far as I know, and somebody correct me if I’m wrong, they’re still trying to ascertain how big of a problem CCD is in Europe. We know it’s there…but we don’t know how much. Here in America, colony losses have been hovering at about 30%/year since 2006 (down to 20% in 2012). About one in three of these was actually attributable to CCD. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1758-2229.2011.00312.x/abstract Graham, As Bill said, CCD is not the same thing as dead bees or dying colonies. CCD is a very specific syndrome which involves a rapid decline of healthy colonies where there is still a queen and some young workers present with few dead bees around the hives, among other things. The differential diagnosis for CCD is listed out above, and has recently been amended to include ‘non-damaging levels of Nosema’ as a part of it. Saying that neonicotinoids are a high risk to bees is very different than saying that they cause CCD. That neonics aren’t good for bees isn’t up for debate (the Xerces report basically says they aren’t), but what we’re actually debating is whether they cause the list of symptoms above. There have been incidents where bees were poisoned by neonics, and in each case this resulted in large numbers of dead bees in and around the hive. So…neonic poisoning does not match the symptoms of CCD, and I think I need to edit the post to more bluntly state that CCD is not the same thing as dead bees. They’ve done surveys of pesticides, and none have explicitly been connected with CCD. Sure, neonics can disrupt some of the social aspects of honeybee life…but that doesn’t make them The One True Cause of CCD. **** Furthermore, the Buglife report Graham White hyperlinked to doesn’t make a single mention of CCD as far as I can tell. I scanned it and they do mention colony losses, but that is *not* the same thing as CCD. I also did a couple word searches (Colony, colony collapse, colony collapse disorder, CCD) to verify this. The report Graham linked to doesn’t contain the text he pasted, and I can’t locate the source for the text via google. The Buglife report is very similar to the Xerces report, except for the fact that it’s a European thing and not an American thing. That being said, I think it’s odd that a European agency would be trying to sort out the American CCD problem without doing a survey to determine the extent of the CCD problem in Europe. So, I went to their website to try to locate the report. The portion of the website with the link to the report that Graham linked to states this in reference to neonics in the very first line: “While this is unlikely to explain Colony Collapse Disorder in the Honey bee, it could be a key contributory factor and may well be part of the cause for widespread declines in wild bee populations. The report also exposes that the current process for approving crop pesticides is inadequate for assessing risks to bees and other wildlife.” http://www.buglife.org.uk/conservation/campaigns/Pesticides+Poisoning+Our+Bees So, even Buglife does not appear to support a direct CCD-Neonic link. I’m not saying that they’re not involved, but it’s not nearly as simple as “CCD is neonic poisoning”. The jury’s still out as to what extent sublethal levels of neonics can disrupt honeybee social structures in field situations. It’s likely there’s some amount of disruption, but I’ve yet to see a paper that demonstrated that neonics can cause bees to abandon a colony in a manner that replicates CCD. However, there is always the possibility I’ve missed something. If you want to send me the updated Buglife meta-analysis, Biofortified has a contact button. I’m not going to give a personal E-mail account out online. Also, please don’t link-dump. If I want to read the original papers, I should be able to locate them through Web of Knowledge. Just send the meta-analysis, please. Charles M. Rader March 16, 2013 at 6:45 am · Reply Joe, thanks for the writeup. I have a question about bee nutrition. I want to stress that it is a question, not even a suggestion. All the attempts to connect CCD with GMO agriculture assume some sort of poisoning is the potential cause. But if diminished bee nutrition is a contributing cause, is it possible that the better weed control that GMO herbicide tolerance makes possible has deprived some bees of pollen variety? E.g. if a population of bees was depending on some weeds as a supplemental source of pollen to contribute a nutrient that was deficient in pollen from the dominant local crop, then better weed control could deprive the bees of that variability. Anastasia Bodnar March 16, 2013 at 2:48 pm · Reply This point has been made about monarch butterflies, too – that herbicide tolerant crops are the cause for lower amounts of weeds. Yes of course that contributes, but I’m thinking there’s lots of other factors as well – such as farm consolidation removing spaces between farms, GPS allowing farmers to spray more precisely (less missed areas) and right up to field edges), and the removal of marginal acres from CRP thanks to high corn prices. Joe Ballenger March 17, 2013 at 6:42 pm · Reply Charles, I really want to thank you for asking that question, because I have to concede that I did not consider that angle. Changes in agricultural landscapes (particularly in weedy areas) have detrimental impacts on both native bees and honeybees because it reduces the amount of food they have to eat. Better weed control means fewer weeds, fewer weeds means less food, less food means worse nutrition. When reading up on GMOs and bees, a lot of the things I read from activists focus mostly on Bt crops and assume a more direct role for GMO crops. I clearly had this in mind when I wrote this piece, and perhaps I was a bit myopic. As Anastasia said, however, there are a lot of landscape changes that result in the reduction of weedy forage. We’ve come a long way, technologically speaking, in the way we manage weeds. More effective herbicides, and herbicide tolerant crops are a part of the new technology. New technology always creates new problems, and advances in how we control for weeds are no different. So, yes…herbicide tolerant crops play a very small and indirect role in causing this problem. However, there are a lot more facets. Anonymous July 2, 2013 at 5:33 pm · Reply I’ve heard that hives located in inner-city areas do better than ones in the country. Has there been any research on this? And if it is the case does it lend weight to the suspicion that poor food source variety may have a part to play in CCD? Tom March 17, 2013 at 5:33 am · Reply This will probably throw some fuel on the GMO-conspiracy fire… Are there attempts at genetically modifying bees to (1) determine if there are endogenous genes that cause increased or decreased susceptibility to CCD and (2) create resistant strains? I know that question 2 is kind of hard to address without knowing the ultimate cause of CCD but would engineered disease and/or insecticide resistance be a way forward? Joe Ballenger March 17, 2013 at 7:01 pm · Reply Tom, Unfortunately, as I understand the situation, there are genes we may be able to use to monitor for CCD (as defined above)…but I’m not sure that we know a whole lot about genes that determine susceptibility. As for insecticide resistance, that’s a much tougher question. The average pollen sample contains a lot of different pesticides which can vary widely according to geographic location. I’m very specific in how I use the term pesticide, and not all of these are *insect*icides. Fungicides and herbicides are also found in pollen samples, and some fungicides are known to interact with insecticides. I’m not sure that breeding for insecticide resistance is a way forward. Instead, I think we should be a lot more careful about how we apply pesticides when plants are flowering. Even that, though…there’s no way to know what impact that would have. There are groups that are breeding honeybees to become better at controlling mites for themselves. Since those mites vector a lot of diseases, that would go a long way towards breaking that cycle. Some of the most common insecticides found in honeybee hives are those used to control mites, and that would go a long way towards reducing honeybee stress. the bug guy March 17, 2013 at 7:04 pm · Reply Genetic modification has already been used on the Dengue Fever vectoring mosquito, Aedes aegypti to produce sterile males that disrupt reproduction. It may be possible to do something to incorporate resistance into the honeybee. old drone March 25, 2013 at 2:59 pm · Reply This is what the regulators let loose in 2004(see below). It is all based on industry “research”. Since then there has been another failed industry “study” and thousands of acute and chronically affected honeybee colonies dieing. 70 % of the 100′s of dead bee samples taken by gov. inspectors tested + for Clothianidin. In the meantime the pesticide companies have made billions of dollars on this group of chemicals. Regulatory Note REG2004-06 Clothianidin 2. Poncho 600 Seed Treatment Insecticide 4. 6.0 Effects on non-target species 1. 6.2.2 Terrestrial organisms 6.2.2.1 Non-target terrestrial invertebrates Clothianidin is very highly toxic to honey bees, with a 48-hour acute oral LD50 of 0.00368 μg a.i./bee (= 3.68 ng a.i./bee). The transformation products TMG, MNG, TZMU and TZNG, however, were of relatively lower toxicity to the honey bees. Field or semi- field studies conducted in Sweden, the United Kingdom, France and Germany as well as in Ontario (Canada) and Minnesota (United States) indicated that there were no significant impacts on honey bees compared with the controls. All of the field/semi-field studies, however, were found to be deficient in design and conduct of the studies and were, therefore, considered as supplemental information only. Moreover, the results of most of the studies indicated that residues of clothianidin, when used as a canola (rapeseed) seed treatment insecticide, were expressed in pollen and nectar of the crop plants (or collected from foraging bees) in concentrations which exceed the measured Regulatory Note – REG2004-06 Page 31 6.2.2.2 acute oral LD50 to the honey bee. The effects on honey bee hives from chronic/long-term exposure to clothianidin residues are unknown. It should also be noted that clothianidin is very persistent in soil, with high carry-over of residues to the next growing season. Clothianidin is also mobile in soil. Given the foregoing, the risk that clothianidin seed treatment may pose to honey bees and other pollinators cannot be fully assessed, owing to the lack of sufficient information and data. Clothianidin may pose a risk to honey bees and other pollinators, if exposure occurs via pollen and nectar of crop plants grown from treated seeds. Joe Ballenger March 31, 2013 at 3:51 pm · Reply Old Drone, The Xerces report I linked to in the original post discusses all of this. Neonics are very likely bad for bees. Again, not exactly a controversial statement…and something I said in the original post. Furthermore, as I said in my original post, Colony Collapse Disorder and dead bees are not synonymous with one another. CCD is largely characterized by hive abandonment, whereas the study you’re talking about seems to be talking about dead bees. This very strongly indicates the condition I am talking about (CCD) and the condition YOU are talking about (acute neonicotinoid poisoning) are completely different. If you would link me to the exact study you’re talking about (which I’m not going to dig up), that would be the best way to facilitate further conversation. Bill Price April 1, 2013 at 9:16 am · Reply Thank you Joe, for having to point this out yet again. Dead bees do not automatically = CCD. Their equivalence is another one of those zombie memes that will never go away On another topic, do you know of many studies regarding Amygdalin (from almond) levels in hives and bees? I am familiar with the London-Shafir (2003) work, but was wondering if this had been looked at more. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00606-003-0272-y#page-1 TravisK April 1, 2013 at 9:51 am · Reply Does anyone have links to field studies that measure neonic levels found in pollen for different seed treated crops? Given how little long-term above-ground insect protection these seed treatments give us I’m curious to what extent the pollen of a treated crop could be an issue. Andre April 12, 2013 at 11:25 am · Reply The European Commission has requested the European Food Safety Authority to assess the risks associated with the use of clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. EFSA delivered its opinions on 16 January 2013. Available starting at: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130116.htm?utm_medium=infocus&utm_source=homepage&utm_campaign=beehealth This gave rise to a lot of dysinformation, starting by EFSA’s own communication team which, to set out the most grotesque here, produced a press release with different keypoints in different languages. For an analysis (in French): http://www.imposteurs.org/article-neonicotinoides-scandale-mediatique-et-politique-sur-fond-d-expertise-de-l-efsa-par-wackes-seppi-115227070.html The European Commission in turn rang the alarm bell and proposed a « temporary » (I am putting quotation marks to indicate that the « temporary », if accepted, will of course be permanent) two-year ban on the major uses of the three neonics in order, the Commission claims, to get evidence on their role in bee losses (pretty stupid approach as there would be no checks…). So far, the proposal has failed. A new attempt to gather a majority for an amended proposal should be made shortly. The United Kingdom Government is one of the few that advocates science-based policies rather than policy-based « science ». It produced « An assessment of key evidence about Neonicotinoids and bees »: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181841/pb13937-neonicotinoid-bees-20130326.pdf.pdf There was also a field trial which led to an article in Nature : http://blogs.nature.com/news/2013/03/uk-study-casts-doubt-on-insecticide-link-to-bee-declines.html Full trial report: http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/scienceResearch/scienceCapabilities/chemicalsEnvironment/documents/reportPS2371Mar13.pdf The gist (from Nature): « Now, a field trial run by FERA [the UK Food and Environment Research Agency], based in Sand Hutton, has failed to find any “clear consistent relationship” between neonicotinoid residues and the size of bumblebee colonies or the number of new queens they produce. “The absence of these effects is reassuring but not definitive,” says the FERA study, which involved assessing the health of colonies near crops grown from seeds that were treated with clothianidin and imidacloprid. » Needless to say that the issue of neonics and bees is extremely politicised in Europe. The question arises whether safety experts in Europe are still able to produce objective assessments, against all sorts of pressures – by so-called NGOs, media, politicians. My answer is: no! The neonic reports testify to this. The EFSA spin doctors wrote: « EFSA scientists have identified a number of risks posed to bees by three neonicotinoid insecticides… ». Yet the reports include a final table which summarises the monitoring reports from member States, i.e. the feedback from field observations. The overall picture is that the situation is not as bleak as claimed. Moreover, the table distinguishes between two situations: « risk identified » (whatever that may mean) and, as alternative, « assessment not finalised » (which could mean: still tracking the evidence of risk). In France (one of the leaders for the ban), thiamethoxam was used over half the oilseed rape area in 2011/2012. There were no complaints from beekeepers in general nor from one of their associations which is extremely vocal on the issue (it behaves in fact like a subsidiary of the anticapitalist movement). How was this translated in the EFSA table? The French did not provide any feedback! Joe Ballenger April 12, 2013 at 5:19 pm · Reply Andre…please re-read what I have written. Neonics are potentially bad for bees. I’ve mentioned this at least three times now, one of these times being in my original post. Neonics can potentially cause hive abandonment, but so can pyrethroids and high amounts of CO2. Hive abandonment is a general response. Other pathogens, including IAPV, can also potentially cause CCD-like symptoms. So, nobody has a handle on what actually causes CCD and the relation of any of these to CCD is uncertian. The papers you’ve posted here all deal with what happens to bees when they’ve been exposed to neonics, and from the brief scan I did none actually looked at neonic residues in CCD hives. There are researchers who have looked at pesticide residues in hives. They have found lots of different pesticides (and not just insecticides), which clouds the issue of what pesticides are doing to bees. They did find neonicotinoids, but they were in very low concentrations and in a very small percentage of the hives. In CCD hives, the only pesticides which occur in higher amounts are largely miticides. Not neonicotinoids. So, no correlation there. As I pointed out earlier there’s also little correlation in the timeline. There are also massive hive losses in areas where neonics aren’t used, but nobody knows if this is CCD or not. This issue is far more complex than the papers you’ve posted let on, and there’s an entire world of literature you’ve systematically ignored. I’m tempted to post references again, but this is at least the third time I’ve discussed these papers in this thread. Posting them again would simply be redundant. I refer you to my above posts which discuss the Xerces white paper, and the Pettis PLOS ONE paper. In other words the papers you have posted here do not support the conclusions you have drawn from them. They are discussing another issue entirely. This is something I basically said in the first paragraph of the original post, and something I flat-out said in multiple previous comments. Please re-read the post. Bill, I am familiar with amygdalin as a cyanogenic glycoside, but I know very little about how it affects honeybees. So, I did a quick search on Web of Knowledge to see if it had been dealt with. There’s an article in the American Bee Journal which suggests that amygdalin could be potentially harmful to the bees if consumed for more than a week…but they say this is an area where more research is needed. So…I don’t know that it’s been looked into. Andre April 14, 2013 at 2:53 am · Reply Joe, I was basically reporting about the situation in Europe. No criticism nor challenging of your post. The key message is that, with respect to bees and pesticides, particularly neonics, science has left the realm of science to become politicised.

See all TPL Why California Is in Desperate Need of Bees The state’s $3.8 billion almond industry may take a huge hit due to colony collapse disorder. Take Action Share Comments More Share with your friends February 12, 2013 By Clare Leschin-Hoar Clare Leschin-Hoar's stories on seafood and food politics have appeared in Scientific American, Eating Well and elsewhere. full bio follow me Love isn’t the only thing blooming around Valentine’s Day. So are California’s 800,000 acres of almond blossoms. But scientists warn there may simply not be enough honey bees available to pollinate this year’s crop, which prompts an ominous question: “Is 2013 the year colony collapse disorder (CCD) begins to impact our food supply?” Mysterious and worrisome bee losses have been on the radar since 2006, but this winter was especially hard on hives, and some experts, like UC Davis entomologist Eric Mussen, predict 2013 could end up as one of the worst honey production years on record. That’s bad news for almond growers, who rely heavily on bees to pollinate the nut trees, and the state’s ag-economy. Almonds are California’s second largest cash crop (behind dairy) and the state’s largest export crop, worth an estimated $3.8 billion. This is big business. According to Scientific Beekeeping, over a million out-of-state bee hives arrive by pickup truck and semi-trailers to work California’s almond orchards, outnumbering local hives two to one, before leaving to pollinate a rotation of flowering crops in other parts of the country. So just how bad could the season be? Pretty bad. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says beekeepers have been losing approximately 30 percent of their honey bees each year. But word of hive losses in the 70-90 percent range are being reported this winter—an unsustainable trend for the nation’s commercial beekeepers, and a worrying decline for fruit and vegetable producers, who rely heavily on the tiny workers. For commercial beekeeper Jeff Anderson, whose bees pollinate crops in California and Minnesota, the declines are jaw dropping. “My operation started last spring with a high count of 3,150 hives. Today I have 992 alive, most in severely weakened condition,” he says. The nation’s almond crop won’t be the only food impacted. “Bees pollinate over 95 different types of fruits and vegetables, with almonds being the most prolific,” Paul Towers, spokesperson for the Pesticide Action Network, tells TakePart. “What happens in the almond crop spells good news or bad news for other crops. There’s a ripple effect as commercial bees get moved from almonds to blueberries to cranberries and pumpkins.” 4 Food Facts From the Future: Gleaning Information From the Director of National Intelligence’s Global Trend 2030 Report While there’s still no scientifically definitive cause for CCD (some suggest weather, parasites and disease), the finger is increasingly being pointed at a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids—including clothiandin, thiamethoxam imidicloprid and sulfoxaflor—currently under consideration at the Environmental Protection Agency. As we told you last year, scientists have linked neonicotinoids use on crops to sudden die-offs of honeybees. The European Commission, on the other hand, recently recommended a two-year suspension of three neonicotinoid insecticides beginning July 1. The U.S. has no such policy, but PAN, along with the Center for Food Safety, Beyond Pesticides and 25 beekeepers filed an emergency legal petition with the EPA to halt use of clothianidin until further studies have been done. The petition was denied.

Subscribers HOME About Us Back Issues Columns Environmental Darkroom Almanac Entertainment Securities Appellate Masthead Tuesday, March 26, 2013 Last Update: 1:32 PM PT EPA Blamed for Bee Colony Collapse Disorder By WILLIAM DOTINGA  Tweet        SAN FRANCISCO (CN) - U.S. environmental regulators illegally approved overuse of pesticides that caused honeybee colony collapse disorder, threatening agriculture throughout North America, nonprofits claim in Federal Court.      Colony collapse disorder has baffled and alarmed farmers and scientists since 2006. Worker bees abandon hives and vanish en masse, leaving behind the queen and unhatched brood, food and honey-and the hive eventually dies.      In the years since beekeepers first reported the catastrophic losses, hives across the United States have seen yearly declines averaging 35 percent.      A 2010 U.S. Department of Agriculture report blames the collapses on a combination of environmental stressors that leave worker bees susceptible to viruses, parasites, mites and other pathogens.      But a peer-reviewed report this year from the European Food Safety Authority said that recent studies show that neonicotinoid pesticides - widely used throughout the world - pose a significant risk to bees and contribute to colony collapse disorder.      In their new federal complaint, environmental groups agree.      Plaintiffs Center for Food Safety, Beyond Pesticides, Sierra Club, Pesticide Action Network North America and Center for Environmental Health - and four beekeepers - sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the top two officials in its Office of Pesticide Programs, its director Steven Bradbury and deputy administrator Bob Perciasepe.      The complaint states: "Clothianidin and thiamethoxam are systemic insecticides that are taken up by a plant's vascular system as it grows and are expressed through its tissues, including flowers, pollen and nectar. They share a common mode of action that damages the central nervous system of honey bees. When bees forage on pollen or nectar from treated crops, or are otherwise exposed to even extremely small levels of these compounds, paralysis and death can result. Over the past decade, the proliferating use of the neonicotinoid class of pesticides has coincided with mass die-offs of honey bee populations in the phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder, documented as early as 2003-2004 in the United States, with first reported case findings in 2006."      Neonicotinoid poisons affect normal bee behavior in a number of ways that combined lead to hive death, according to the complaint.      "Honey bees are social insects that rely heavily on memory, cognition and communication to coordinate activities essential for their survival. Chronic ingestion of neonicotinoids damages foraging behavior, overall mobility and the communication by which they coordinate their activities. Neonicotinoid pesticides can also have several other indirect effects on honey bees, such as causing premature shifts in hive roles. They can impair honey bees' medium-term olfactory memory and associative learning abilities, which foraging honey bees rely on to find their way back to the hive," the complaint states.      The environmentalists accuse the EPA of turning a blind eye for years to the deliberate misuse of neonicotinoids by farmers, who ignore warnings and directions for use of the pesticides. Clothianidin and thiamethoxam are both marketed by Bayer AG under a number of brand names, and Syngenta also has worldwide distribution rights for thiamethoxam.      "Due to EPA's actions and inactions alleged herein, clothianidin and thiamethoxam are spread widely throughout hundreds of millions of acres of both agricultural and neighboring lands. The neighboring lands are where these toxic compounds are not intended to be and are often lands not owned by the farmers applying the compounds. These lands adjacent to agricultural fields in many cases are prime remaining bee and native insect habitats. Due to the long persistence of these compounds and the uncontrollable drifting and blowing of contaminated dust and soil, bees and other insects are victims of multiple exposure pathways that EPA failed to assess when the agency approved the pesticides - and still has failed to assess. Key among these exposure pathways are residues in pollen and nectar, dust from treated seeds and soils, planter exhaust, untreated but contaminated non-crop plants adjacent to treated fields, contaminated puddles in fields and adjacent surface water, guttation [the secretion of water from the pores of plants] droplets on both treated and untreated but contaminated plants and residue from foliar uses," the complaint states.      EPA scientists have repeatedly described the severe impacts of neonicotinoids on bee populations in their own internal risk assessments, the environmentalists say. And in countries where use of clothianidin and thiamethoxam has been suspended or restricted - Austria, Italy, France, Germany and Slovenia - honey bee colonies began to thrive again.      To its credit, the EPA has suggested "non-mandatory best management practices" to reduce the environmental effects of clothianidin and thiamethoxam. But the EPA claims it lacks the authority to do more than that under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, or FIFRA.      The environmentalists say that even if the agency had the authority to further regulate the pesticides, it would take years for users to comply with enhanced regulations.      "As a result, clothianidin- and thiamethoxam-treated seeds will continue to be planted across hundreds of millions of acres in 2013 and beyond. To date, EPA has provided no formal direction or label changes to farmers on how to minimize non-target effects, how and where to clean out crop planters, or what steps to take to avoid effects to nearby honey bees or insect-pollinated plants. In short, the imminent hazard the defendants have allowed will reinitiate in about April 2013, when corn and other crop planting season begins again," according to the complaint.      Neonicotinoids also harm other beneficial insects, including bumblebees, butterflies, ladybug and lacewings, dragonflies and hoverflies. These are essential to pollination and insect control and are being decimated by the pesticides as well, the environmentalists say.      And even after finding that "clothianidin is expected to present acute and/or chronic toxicity risk to endangered/threatened birds and mammals via possible ingestion of treated corn and canola seeds ... [and] via residue-laden pollen and nectar" across the United States, the EPA has shirked its duty to consult with Fish and Wildlife Service about approval of the pesticides, the groups say.      "For at least one neoncotinoid insecticide, FWS scientists are on record stating 'EPA is ignoring their duties with respect to consulting with FWS.' This is in fact true for all thiamethoxam and clothianidin product use approvals subject to this action. According to EPA documents, there are hundreds of federally listed threatened and endangered species occurrences in states where clothianidin and thiamethoxam are used in which direct or indirect effects are foreseeable, but EPA has disregarded those effects determinations with respect to the Endangered Species Act consultation requirements," the complaint states.      Despite FIFRA requirements that the EPA make its data public before registering a pesticide for use, the EPA routinely fails to do so, according to the complaint. And the EPA routinely issues "conditional" approvals which remain in place without further examination for up to 10 years.      "Together with a coalition of beekeepers and public interest groups, plaintiffs Beyond Pesticides and PANNA delivered a letter to defendants dated Dec. 8, 2010, requesting suspension of clothianidin's registration due to inadequate data on impacts to pollinators and excessive agency delay in ensuring compliance with that condition. By letter of Feb. 18, 2011, defendants refused that suspension request. Plaintiffs CFS, Beyond Pesticides, PANNA, Steve Ellis and Tom Theobald, along with a coalition of beekeepers and honey producers and public interest groups, submitted the Clothianidin Legal Petition to EPA to suspend the registration of clothianidin on March 20, 2012, rooted in the nine-year unreasonable delay in ensuring full compliance with the 'conditional registration' conditions for clothianidin. They followed that petition with two supplemental filings, dated May 3, 2012 and June 18, 2012, respectively. These consisted of information that came to light after the petition was filed, including critical new data on how certain uses of clothianidin constitute an 'imminent hazard' to honey bees and other beneficial insects that compelled a decision to promptly suspend clothianidin's registration. By letter dated July 17, 2012, defendants denied the portion of the petition that alleged an 'imminent threat' existed. That letter indicated EPA did not consider the May 3, 2012 and June 18, 2012 supplemental filings in making that decision. To date, the agency has yet to issue a decision based on the supplemental evidence showing imminent hazard or on any of the other new science and extensive mass honey bee kill data that emerged after the petition was filed. Defendant Bradbury's letter of July 17, 2012 stated his denial of the imminent hazard claim in the petition was EPA's 'final action pursuant to section 16 of FIFRA' with respect to that claim. There was no Federal Register notice, no public hearing and no opportunity for notice and comment prior to this final action. The EPA has yet to resolve any of the remaining claims in the petition or to reconsider its denial of an 'imminent hazard' based on the full administrative record before it," the environmentalists say in the complaint.      EPA scientists warned the agency to do more study on the effects of clothianidin on bee colonies as early as February 2003, the groups say. Two months later, the EPA issued a conditional approval for the poison - allowing it to go on sale nationwide - while the registrant supposedly made arrangements to conduct the study.      "To date, for clothianidin, the requirement of a complete and adequate life-cycle study and evaluation of exposure and effects to the queen bee, remains unmet. This also applies in the case of thiamethoxam, as EPA's pollinator field test conditions for it incorporated and mirrored the conditions imposed for clothianidin," the complaint states.      The groups say similar attempts to reverse the conditional registration of thiamethoxam - which the bees metabolize into clothianidin - met with the dismal same fate at the EPA.      The agency estimates it will make its final decision on the poisons' conditional registrations in 2018 - 15 years after receiving the applications and issuing conditional approvals.      This is not the first time the EPA has faced criticism for its conditional approval of clothianidin. In 2008, the National Resources Defense Council demanded the agency produce records on to its permit to Bayer.      On its website , the NRDC - which is not a party to the beekeepers' complaint - lists 42 crops grown in the U.S. that require bees for pollination.      "The list of crops that simply won't grow without honey bees is a long one: Apples, cucumbers, broccoli, onions, pumpkins, carrots, avocados, almonds ... and it goes on. Without bees to pollinate many of our favorite fruits and vegetables, the United States could lose $15 billion worth of crops - not to mention what it would do to your diet," the NRDC says on its website.      The environmental groups and beekeepers seek declaratory and injunctive relief for EPA violations of the Endangered Species Act, Administrative Procedure Act and FIFRA. They want the court to vacate the agency's conditional approvals of products containing clothianidin and thiamethoxam and an immediate suspension of their use.      They are represented by house counsel for the Center for Food Safety's counsel: George Kimbrell, Peter Jenkins, Paige Tomaselli and Sylvia Shih-Yau Wu.  Home Back to Top Courthouse News Service Privacy Policy Search RSS About Us

Photo by: Jon Sullivan. Colony Collapse Disorder: Common Pesticides Disrupt Brain Functioning in Bees. Update via Reddit r/permaculture: Recent bee related death reports: Bee deaths a result of pesticide Safari; count upped to 50,000 dead insects Meanwhile, other reports of bees dying around Wilsonville and surrounding towns have prompted Xerces to check whether similar pesticides were used elsewhere. “My worry is that we’re going to lose sight of the real message,” said Mace Vaughan of Xerces. “I think we’re (using insecticides) all over the place, and people are doing it in their backyards without even knowing it.” U.S. Bee Deaths From Colony Collapse Disorder May Be Tied To Diet, Study Finds (Boston, MA) Agrichemical and pesticide makers like Monsanto, Bayer AG and Syngenta are also launching projects to study and counter colony collapse. Few deny that pesticides – particularly a class of commonly used insecticides called neonicotinoids – can be harmful to bees in the laboratory. It is unclear what threat the insecticides pose under current agricultural usage. Some scientists say habitat decline and disease-carrying parasites, such as the Varroa mite, are the chief cause of bee deaths. Agri-giants trying to solve bee deaths (St. Louis, MO) One of every three bites of food we consume depends on pollination by honeybees, but these overlooked contributors to our food system are continuing to die in stubbornly perplexing ways. In 2006, beekeepers started noticing that bees were abandoning their hives, a phenomenon scientists dubbed Colony Collapse Disorder. Since then, the American bee population has dropped by an average of 30 percent every year, sending researchers, beekeepers and farmers into a head-scratching frenzy to figure out the cause. Study links insecticides to bee deaths (Quebec, Canada) According to Jean-Pierre Chapleau, spokesman for the Quebec Beekeepers’ Federation, beekeepers want neonicotinoid insecticides banned. “Neonicotinoid insecticides are overused,” he says. Chapleau said that beekeepers don’t blame farmers, because they can’t buy seeds that have not been treated with insecticides even if they want to. The industry says that’s not accurate. Scottish bee deaths double in a single year (Scotland) SBA president Phil McAnespie said: “Last summer and autumn were very bad, which is obviously an issue and viruses are associated with that. “I think most of the losses are down to the weather. Obviously, there is concern about neonicotinoids and there is ongoing research into that but I don’t think they have played any major part in this [the increase in bee deaths].” Update: Animal agriculture carnage: Third of all honeybee colonies in England did not survive winter (guardian.co.uk) Update: Bee keepers’ use of corn syrup and other honey substitutes as bee feed may be contributing to colony collapse (reuters.com) Update: 1/3 of US Honeybee Colonies Died Last Winter, Threatening US Food Supply – “We’re getting closer & closer to the point where we don’t have enough bees in this country to meet pollination demands,” said entomologist Dennis vanEngelstorp, who led survey documenting declines. (wired.com) Update: It’s confirmed: It’s getting worse. Cover of the NY Times today, edging out even the Taliban. Thing is, this threat we know how to stop. “Bee Die-Off Soars, Putting Crops at Risk A mysterious malady seems to have expanded drastically in the past year, wiping out as many as half of the beehives needed to pollinate much of America’s produce.” Exposure to commonly used pesticides directly disrupts brain functioning in bees, according to new research in Nature.” While the study is the first to record that popular pesticides directly injure bee brain physiology, it adds to a slew of recent studies showing that pesticides, especially neonicotinoids, are capable of devastating bee hives and may be, at least, partly responsible for on-going Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Christopher Connolly with the University of Dundee in Scotland and his team exposed honeybees to two pesticides at levels encountered in the wild: neonicotinoids and miticidal pesticides. By recording brain activity after exposure, the researchers found that both pesticides directly hampered bee brain functioning, including blocking neurons from firing. The findings are especially notable for studying bees after exposure to the miticidal pesticide, which is used directly on bee hives to safeguard them from a common parasite, the Varroa destructor mite. In this case, however, the cure may be worse than the disease. Connolly explains: “Much discussion of the risks posed by the neonicotinoid insecticides has raised important questions of their suitability for use in our environment. However, little consideration has been given to the miticidal pesticides introduced directly into honeybee hives to protect the bees from the Varroa mite. We find that both have negative impact on honeybee brain function.” Furthermore the researchers found that when bees were exposed to both chemicals—the neonicotinoids and miticidal pesticides—their brain functioning and learning abilities were hurt even more. The study is the first to show the direct brain impacts that may explain why bees exposed to these pesticides slow aberrant behavior, including losing their way easily and slow reactions. Scientists both in the U.S. and Europe have recorded the complete collapse of hives following exposure. However, pesticide companies have continually argued that their products cause no harm to bees even as high-profile independent research from multiple sources appears to be telling a very different story. The research has spurred some policy movement. France has banned the use of neonicotinoids on certain crops. The EU proposed a ban on neonicotinoids for two years after a committee looked at the research for six months. However, the ban was scuttled by opposition from Germany and the UK, though it could still come up in appeal. Most recently, nine beekeeping and environmental groups sued the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to take action to protect bees. Bees are key plant pollinators, and their decline has worried scientists, farmers, and policymakers worldwide. In the U.S. alone, bee pollination is estimated to be worth $8-12 billion. While bee declines have occurred in the past, researchers believe this one is much more severe. Citation: Mary J. Palmer,Christopher Moffat, Nastja Saranzewa, Jenni Harvey, Geraldine A.

Reply Tom says: June 14, 2013 at 07:30 BREAKING: 99.9% of all dinosaurs on Earth did not survive the asteroid impact 65 million years ago. Seriously, enough fear mongering… "Scientists have estimated that over the course of Earth's history, anywhere between 1 and 4 billion species have existed on this planet. Be it through disease, genetic obsolescence, over-predation or any number of other factors, the overwhelming majority of these species are now extinct. Of these billions of species, roughly 50 million still survive into the modern era. While these numbers are certainly extreme at first glance, it serves as proof that extinction, while a sad occurrence, is a part of life for all living things." http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/how-speci… Humans fear change – we like everything to stay the same, all the time. The same way we don't like our favorite restaurants going out of business, we don't like thinking that a species will go extinct (because it makes us realize that WE could go extinct). We fear that "everything will collapse" in a sort of butterfly-effect if one tiny cog on the gear breaks. This is absolutely not the case, as we know because of our scientific understanding of biology and ecosystems. People also forget about this little thing called "evolution", which, as we know, is driven by "survival of the fittest". The species that best adapt to changes in their environment are the ones that survive. If the bees don't make it, they don't make it – just like the billions of other species that didn't make it (even before humans were around…). Changes in environment can cause species to go extinct, but look around – there is life EVERYWHERE. These changes can range from natural disasters, to asteroid impacts, to shifts in climate due to continental drift, to overpopulation of predators, to the under-supply of food source, to disease. Reality: the population count of all species is always changing, and sometimes they go extinct. That's life, folks. Maybe all the bees dying off isn't as scary as you think…stop freaking out, and please, stop fear mongering. Life will continue on this planet as it has for appx. 2 billion years. I know what your counter fear-driven argument is going to be: "BUT IF ALL THE BEES DIE THEN OUR FOOD SUPPLY WILL DWINDLE BECAUSE THE BEES POLLINATE MOST OF OUR CROPS! THEN WE'LL BE THE ONES AT RISK OF POPULATION DECLINE!" Except that…that's not going to happen, for multiple reasons. There are lots of numbers out that that get thrown around. I've seen claims as high as "1/3 of the foods we eat"…but here's the thing: just because we currently eat certain foods, doesn't mean we need to eat them to survive. You know what grows without the intervention of bees? Most plants…including the foods that sustain most of the world: from corn and rice, to potatoes to various leafy greens. Second, evolution is similar to capitalism: if there is supply available, a demand will arise. So honey bees stop pollinating? Well, either a stronger species of honey bee will come about or different species will take their place in the usage of the pollen (causing pollination). Bees aren't the only species that use pollen, you know. If there is more pollen to go around for other species (because the bees aren't using it), those other species will likely grow in population and continue the pollination work of the bees. Life on this plant is far more complex than you can imagine. Stop worrying about every single little cog…the planet, and the life on it, will continue as it has for 2 billion years.
