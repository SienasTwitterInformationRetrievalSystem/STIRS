Gallo, March 8, 2013  |  Meet the Blogger  |  More Posts by Walter Robb and A.C. Gallo Whole Foods Market commits to full GMO transparency by giving supplier partners five years to source non-GMO ingredients or to clearly label products with ingredients containing GMOs. Today, we stood up for the consumer’s right to know by announcing that all products in our US and Canadian stores containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) must be clearly labeled within five years. We heard our customers loud and clear asking us for GMO labeling and we are responding where we have control: in our own stores. We are the first national grocery chain to set a deadline for full GMO transparency. By 2018, we will require our supplier partners to label products containing GMO ingredients, and we will work in collaboration with them as they transition to sourcing non-GMO ingredients or to clearly labeling products with ingredients containing GMOs. This is a complicated issue, and we wanted to give our supplier partners enough time to make this change. Fortunately, many of our suppliers are already well on their way to moving to Non-GMO ingredients and a good number are already there. While five years is the deadline, we know there will be progress much sooner and we plan to announce key milestones along the way. The prevalence of GMOs in the US paired with nonexistent mandatory labeling makes it very difficult for grocery stores to source non-GMO choices and for consumers to choose non-GMO products. Yet we know our customers care passionately. In fact, Non-GMO™ Project verified products are among the fastest growing sellers in our non-perishable grocery category.  For many years, we’ve sourced our 365 Everyday Value products to avoid GMOs in their plant-based ingredients and in 2009, we began putting this line through the Non-GMO Project verification program and encouraged our grocery supplier partners to do the same. Whole Foods Market currently sells 3,300 Non-GMO Project verified products from 250 brands, more than any other retailer in North America. We will continue this important work and our customers will see more and more Non-GMO Project Verified labels on products throughout our stores. While the US and Canada still have no labeling laws, more than 60 countries do. However, many US states are currently considering mandatory labeling initiatives, like the one in Washington state, where 500,000 citizens signed a petition last year to move the initiative the next step to their state legislature for consideration. Whole Foods Market supports that ballot measure in Washington and hopes it and other such state initiatives will finally lead to one uniform set of rules in support of the consumer's right to know. There are also efforts that have made GMOs now part of a national conversation. JustLabelIt.org, for instance, has collected over 1.5 million signatures in support of mandatory federal labeling. And while we are encouraged by the many mandatory labeling initiatives, we are committed to moving forward with our own GMO transparency plan now. Until the GMO labeling requirement is fully effective, shoppers can rely on Non-GMO Project verified products and certified organic products if they want to avoid GMOs. The US National Organic Standards prohibit the intentional use of GMO seed in the production of organic crops. As a pioneer in the US organic food movement for the past 32 years, we offer thousands of organic products, the largest variety in the country. To ensure a growing supply of non-GMO options for our customers, we are stepping up our support of organic and certified products, and we are growing the non-GMO supply chain with our supplier partners. We are as excited about this announcement as we are dedicated to supporting transparency and our customers’ right to know what’s in their food. Hear more from Walter Robb about the announcement in this video on his blog and watch the announcement made at Natural Products Expo here.

THANK YOU!!! I thank you. My kids thank you and our health thank you. I am hoping other stores will follow but I will be shopping at Whole Foods a heck of alot more now! Thank you! 03/08/2013 11:20:47 AM CST Charla Reaves says ... I have always thought your stores were an excellent source for shopping organic, offering more choices than any other store around. This new initiative puts you over the top in excellence. You obviously listen to the consumers and it is so refreshing to see you take such action. I am a committed customer to your store, because you are obviously committed to your customers. 03/08/2013 11:25:04 AM CST Jen says ... Thank you! Will you be tackling BPA packaging next? It would be so helpful to know which cans contain BPAs and which don't (even better if all 365 brand packages didn't contain BPAs). 03/08/2013 11:25:29 AM CST Antwan Barnes says ... Thank you for this helpful initiative. 03/08/2013 11:28:07 AM CST Jillian says ... THANK YOU WHOLE FOODS! For doing the job that the gov't refuses to do! This is a private company responding to citizen demand and this is how our country should work!! Thank you for taking the first step so that GMO's will eventually be run out of our food supply because consumers will choose not purchase them! Thank you Whole Foods for finally giving people in the USA the FREEDOM of choice! Now... if you can only add more Whole Foods stores across the US!! You have NONE in Northwest Florida, we need you down here, I moved down here and am so sad without a whole foods! The closest ones are at least 6 hours away!! 03/08/2013 11:29:04 AM CST Kate says ... Thank you!! It really should be a given that we know what we are buying. It is unfortunate it will take that long. I am grateful it's happening. Thank you for taking a stand. 03/08/2013 11:30:56 AM CST Beth Walsh says ... Eeeeeek! Best news ever! On behalf of my soon to be newborn daughter (due May 2): Thank You, Thank You, Thank You! 03/08/2013 11:34:54 AM CST Anna C says ... Thank you so much WFM!!! You are making this world a better place with this movement and I am proud to be a loyal customer. God bless!! 03/08/2013 11:44:53 AM CST Staci says ... I'm surprisingly shocked to read this. With the distance and lack of support Whole Foods showed during California's Prop 37 initiative this wasn't an action I expected to see. I'm very excited you've made such a bold move as it will force great change in the industry. Thank you!!! 03/08/2013 11:48:48 AM CST Fuller Callaway says ... Thank you! i am glad you stepped up and made this decision and commitment for your customers! 03/08/2013 11:53:35 AM CST Guenter de Vincent says ... All I can say super move for Whole Foods 03/08/2013 12:05:12 PM CST Tara says ... THANK YOU! 03/08/2013 12:12:22 PM CST Christi Demuth says ... 5YEARS?? IT COULD BE DONE IN 1-2 YEARS. Is this just a marketing ploy? 03/08/2013 12:13:11 PM CST Laurie says ... This is wonderful news! Thank you for helping us, the consumers, to make this a reality! Now if all supermarket chains could take this issue seriously and follow your lead. I look forward to gaining more knowledge on what my family is eating. 03/08/2013 12:19:14 PM CST Lucy Nickel says ... Does this great news of GMO labeling coming soon to Wholefoods apply for Canada as well?? Waiting for your reply, Thank-you. Lucy Nickel 03/08/2013 12:20:13 PM CST Mary Nolan says ... I am very excited about this news! The closest Whole Foods to me is 15 miles one way, no matter which of the 3 I choose to shop. So, since I've drastically altered my eating habits and lifestyle to accommodate my avoidance of GMO products, I shop at Whole Foods at least 2x a week. If I can feel assured that work is moving in the direction of clear labeling, it will make the shopping experience so much more pleasant again, rather than a nauseating chore. I've already seen positive changes in the labeling at Whole Foods! May I ask if the deli selections can be included in this as well, so that I know I am buying organic? I look forward to updates! 03/08/2013 12:23:12 PM CST Craig Toth says ... I wish it began sooner, but this is a start. 03/08/2013 12:30:10 PM CST Nikki - Community Moderator says ... @CHRISTI - Absolutely not a marketing ploy. This is a complicated issue. We wanted to give our supplier partners enough time to make this change. While 5 years is the deadline, we know there will be progress much sooner. We plan to announce key milestones along the way. 03/08/2013 12:31:26 PM CST ginger says ... Thanks for the infor and doing your part! much obliged! 03/08/2013 12:37:29 PM CST Kris Horrocks says ... THANK YOU! 03/08/2013 12:38:32 PM CST Cindy S. says ... Thank you! I hope many other stores follow your example. We won't eat anything unless it's organic or Non-GMO Project verified, so this will be a big help to us. 03/08/2013 12:40:11 PM CST Dana Preston says ... Awesome! I hope others follow your lead. 03/08/2013 12:44:06 PM CST Mari Whittelsey says ... Why five years? This has been going on for 20. We need this sooner. 03/08/2013 12:44:21 PM CST Denettee says ...

Jump to navigation Right to Know GMO Coalition of States for GMO Labeling Maryland Return to the map 2014 HB 1191 was introduced in February 2014, and has 19 sponsors. According to the bill’s text, part of the purpose of requiring GMO labeling is to “protect public health by serving as a risk management tool that will enable consumers, physicians, and scientists to identify unintended health effects resulting from the consumption of genetically engineered foods and enabling consumers to avoid potential risks associated with genetically engineered foods.” You can read the bill text here and track its status here. Companion measure SB 778, introduced in January 2014, has eight sponsors, and you can track that bill’s status here. Both bills list a hearing scheduled for March 11th. 2013 GMO free MARYLAND is a 501c4 grass roots movement in the state of MARYLAND. It's mission is to publish the newest research and educational materials regarding the health risks, environmental impacts and social ramifications of genetically engineered food and it's supportive technologies. The first priority is to help consumers make better food choices by identifying ingredients to be avoided and vendors to be trusted. We encourage individuals to increase awareness locally and mobilize with larger group as there is strength in numbers. We have established a working relationship with many national food safety organizations including: Organic Consumers Association, Center for Food Safety, Institute for Responsible Technology, Food & Water Watch, Food Democracy Now! and others. With the introduction of 3 GMO labeling bills in the last 2 years in MARYLAND, we are making progress and it is our ultimate goal to work directly with legislators in Annapolis and DC to show the growing support for passing GMO labeling Laws in the state of MARYLAND. To learn more about what's happening in your state, visit GMO Free MD and join them at their Meetups.

Jump to navigation Right to Know GMO Coalition of States for GMO Labeling Texas Return to the map When SB 81 in 2011, it gave  home bakers in Texas the right to legally sell cakes, cookies, and other non-perishable foods ans long as the individual: (1) ensure(d) that the minimum standards prioritize safe handling of fruits and vegetables based on known safety risks, including any history of outbreaks of food-borne communicable diseases; and (2) (the produce was) consider(ed) acceptable produce safety standards developed by a federal agency, state agency, or university. It wedged the door open for HB 970 which is current today. HB 970 has been filed by Representative Eddie Rodriguez. It would allow individuals to make foods (canned jams, jellies, dried herbs, and non-hazardous baked goods) in their kitchens and sell them directly to consumers without any penalization or regulation from their local or state health departments. It allows this as long as sales are less than $50,000. If passed, HB 970 expands the list of food allowed, lets individuals sell at a location other than their home, and prohibits municipalities from outlawing cottage food operations through zoning. Though no word of GMOs is mentioned, it starts a conversation about food and labeling. As of March 5, 2013 the bill is In Committee and no hearing is currently set.

Modified Food, Gm Labeling, Gmo, Gmos, Whole Food Gmo, Whole Foods Announcement, Whole Foods Gmos, Green News Whole Foods has announced that by 2018, all products in U.S. and Canada stores must be labeled if they contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This is the first national grocery store to set a deadline from GMO labeling. “We are putting a stake in the ground on GMO labeling to support the consumer’s right to know,” said Walter Robb, co-CEO of Whole Foods Market, in a press release. “The prevalence of GMOs in the U.S. paired with nonexistent mandatory labeling makes it very difficult for retailers to source non-GMO options and for consumers to choose non-GMO products. Accordingly, we are stepping up our support of certified organic agriculture, where GMOs are not allowed, and we are working together with our supplier partners to grow our non-GMO supply chain to ensure we can continue to provide these choices in the future.” Genetically modified organism have been manipulated through genetic engineering by introducing changes into DNA structure. This announcement comes at a time where interest in GMO labeling is at an all-time high. During the November election, a mandatory GMO labeling initiative -- Prop 37 -- was introduced in California. Millions of dollars poured in from various corporations such as Monsanto and PepsiCo against the ballot measure, which was ultimately defeated. A recent poll by The Huffington Post in partnership with YouGov found that a huge majority -- 82 percent -- of Americans want labels for GMO food. Gary Hirshberg, the CEO of Stonyfield Yogurt and the chairman and founding partner of the Just Label It campaign, has been a vocal proponent of the move to label GMO foods. In a recent blog for The Huffington Post, he explains: Our government's failure to require labeling, and to be engaged in developing the science supporting GE food risk assessment is an absolute breach of its responsibility to the American public. There are in fact lots of reasons to label these foods: health and environmental concerns, ethical/religious views or just because people want to know. In fact, Mellman research shows 92 percent of citizens want the right to know with no meaningful statistical difference between men and women, Republicans and Democrats, urban and rural communities, education level or any demographic. The bottom line is: without labeling, consumers are completely in the dark. The FDA can label GE foods. And the vast majority of consumers want them to be labeled. Not everyone agrees with Hirshberg, though. Recently, a former activist for non-GMO food switched his stance and no longer advocates against genetically modified food. Whole Foods has been selling non-GMO foods for years -- any certified organic food cannot be made using GMO crops, for example. The company will continue to makes announcements about progress between now and the 2018 deadline.

Rockfish Some species of <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_search.aspx?s=rockfish" target="_hplink">rockfish</a> will disappear from Whole Foods, but others will still be found. Among the threatened varieties are some species of Alaskan rockfish, which may already be locally depleted. They're also caught with environmentally-destructive trawls. Tuna Whole Foods stopped selling bluefin <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_search.aspx?s=tuna" target="_hplink">tuna</a> several years ago, and now banned tunas include species listed as "<a href="http://blog.wholefoodsmarket.com/2011/04/no-red-rated-tuna-swordfish/" target="_hplink">red</a>" by its partners. <em>Photo by Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/invernodreaming/6125533828/sizes/o/in/photostream/" target="_hplink">InvernoDreaming</a>.</em> Swordfish Many <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_search.aspx?s=swordfish" target="_hplink">swordfish</a> are caught with methods that are often snare sea turtles, seabirds and sharks. Whole Foods will only carry swordfish caught using handlines, which involve a single baited line that catch one fish at a time and result in virtually no bycatch.
