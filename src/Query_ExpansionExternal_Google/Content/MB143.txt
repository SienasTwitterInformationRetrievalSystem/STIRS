The Joao Havelange stadium in Rio de Janeiro was built only six years ago. It was also being used as the main football venue in Rio, while the city's Maracana stadium is being renovated for next year's World Cup. It is an embarrassment for Brazil as it prepares for its two huge sporting events, say correspondents. The authorities have also acknowledged delays in work on the Maracana and a funding problem at another stadium, which is set to host the opening match at the World Cup. 'Not acceptable' Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes told a news conference on Tuesday that he had been told about the structural problems at the stadium - locally referred to as the Engenhao - earlier the same day. "I asked if this represented a risk for spectators and they told me it did, depending on the wind speed and temperature. "On that basis, I immediately decided to close the stadium until we had more details." He said the situation was "simply not acceptable" for a stadium which opened such a short time ago, and warned that those responsible would be held to account. The stadium opened late and over budget in 2007. It has since been leased to local football club Botafogo.

' document.write(script); Back Home Brazil Dealing With Stadium Renovation Issues As '14 World Cup, '16 Olympics Beckon Brazil Dealing With Stadium Renovation Issues As '14 World Cup, '16 Olympics Beckon Published March 28, 2013 Authorities said there are structural problems with the stadium's roof Brazil's preparations for the '14 World Cup and the '16 Olympic Games "ran into more trouble yesterday" when authorities closed Estádio Olímpico João Havelange because of "structural problems with its roof," according to Dom Phillips of the LONDON TIMES. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes said that the stadium would "be closed indefinitely." He added that the problems "represented a risk for fans," and the stadium would "remain closed until it was given the all clear." Officials said that the stadium would "not now be used for the Confederations Cup in June or for the 2014 World Cup, and Botafago and other Rio clubs were looking for alternative venues." The stadium opened in '07 for the Pan Am Games and "was considered the most modern sporting venue in Latin America" ( LONDON TIMES, 3/28). Meanwhile, in London, Scott-Elliot & Sandy write England's men's national soccer team is "due to play Brazil in the refurbished Maracana Stadium in Rio on 2 June but it is still undergoing major building work and is unlikely to meet its 27 April completion deadline." Reports in Rio suggest that it "will not be finished" until May 25. FIFA is due to "take over the Maracana" on May 27 for the Confederations Cup. The April deadline was "supposed to allow time to stage a test event before England arrive and any delay into May will raise questions over whether an adequate test can be conducted." If completion is delayed, the England game "may have to be used as one of the test events in front of a reduced capacity crowd." The Maracana's US$571M upgrade was "supposed to be finished before Christmas but has fallen further and further behind schedule." The Olympic Stadium would have "offered an ideal fall-back if the Maracana is not ready" ( London INDEPENDENT, 3/28 ).

Maracana work delayed by floods as FIFA cancel inspection visit By Gerard Brand Follow @@gedbrand10 Published: 06:36 EST, 7 March 2013 | Updated: 09:11 EST, 7 March 2013 3 View comments It wouldn't be a major tournament without stadium fears, and the preparation for the 2014 World Cup is Brazil is no different. After heavy rain hit Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday, FIFA had to cancel yesterday's inspection of the famous Maracana stadium as some equipment was submerged in rain water. But it's not all doom and gloom for Brazil, with the Maracana organisers playing catch up to the likes of the Mineirao Stadium, which already comes complete with a roof and pitch. Scroll down for video Submerged: The Maracana is already behind schedule, with organisers concerned about testing the stadium before the World Cup Rio's Maracana stadium is FIFA's main worry as Brazil prepares to host the Confederations Cup in June, FIFA secretary-general Jerome Valcke said on Tuesday. '[Rio] is the one which is causing FIFA the most concern,' said Valcke. 'The date of completion is very important so we can test them before the start,' Valcke said. 'May is too late and that could cause a lot of trouble for FIFA, for the World Cup and for Brazil.' WORLD CUP 2014 STADIUM UPDATE Mane Garrincha (Brasilia) - Work now '89 per cent complete' Arena Corinthians (Sao Paulo) - Work now '60 per cent complete' Castelao (Fortaleza) - Complete, hosted first game in January Mineriao (Belo Horizonte) - Complete, but eventual occupancy is in dispute Beira-Rio (Porto Alegre) - Bulk of renovation complete, expected opening in September Arena Fonte Nova (Salvador) - Expected opening at the end this month Arena Pernambuco (Recife) - Work now '90 per cent complete' Arena Pantanal (Cuiaba) - Work now '60 per cent complete' Arena Da Amazonia (Manaus) - Around 50 per cent complete Arena Das Dunas (Natal) - On schedule, but worries with roof and post-2014 occupancy Arena Da Baixada (Curitiba) - Work now '55 per cent complete' And the unexpected flooding has not helped the situation, with Valcke seemingly genuinely worried for the state of the iconic stadium. 'If you see images of the stadium you will be concerned. The stadium is under water. We are really concerned.' But Rio de Janeiro authorities downplayed the disruption caused by the flood, saying: 'The problems caused by the rain were being solved and the construction timetable was not affected.' Bridge over troubled water: Access to the equipment has been haulted (above) while the roof was only partially completed in February (below) FIFA has said the six stadiums which will host matches in the Confederations Cup, considered a dress rehearsal for the 2014 World Cup, must be ready by mid-April. The Maracana, built for the 1950 World Cup and remodelled several times since, was due for completion in December but the deadline was put back to February and then April. The latest rebuilding work started in 2010 at a cost of $457million, with a re-opening friendly with England scheduled for June 2. Miles ahead: The Mineirao Stadium has already been completed Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) technical director Virgilio Elisio said on Monday he was worried and that work would have to speed up. Meanwhile the Recife stadium, previously one of the major headaches and which was less than half complete when the local organising committee visited for the first time last year, is 90 per cent ready, officials said. 'Now we have to work on the pitch, which is the most important project,' said Valcke. 'The pitch will be planted in the new few weeks but we don't have much time for it to be ready.'

The Joao Havelange Olympic Stadium, known locally as the Engenhao, will have to undergo roof repairs before it can be declared fit for use. Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes said he had been told that the structural problems could pose a risk for spectators, depending on the wind speed and temperature. "On that basis, I immediately decided to close the stadium until we had more details," he told a news conference. "It's simply not acceptable that a stadium which was inaugurated such a short time ago now has to face this sort of situation." Designed by architects Carlos Porto and Gilson Santos, the stadium opened late and over budget in 2007 and is currently the city's main football venue while the Maracana Stadium is rebuilt for this year's Confederations Cup and the 2014 World Cup. Rio intends to build only nine permanent sites and six temporary venues for the 2016 Olympics in an attempt to avoid the legacy of 'white elephant' sporting venues suffered by former host cities Athens and Beijing. Other sports venues we've reported on lately include Zaha Hadid Architects' successful bid to design the new national stadium for Japan and a competition-winning design for a football stadium in Ethiopia with stands built into mounds of earth – see all stadiums.

See our copyright policy. Before commenting, please read our comments policy. http://twitter.com/burtja @burtja Infrastructure is all running late. This issue shows a huge lack of quality control and Brazil is horrendously expensive. It does not bode well for the World Cup and Olympics. sor perdida No wonder things are toppling down. With such a corrupt empire, they shouldn’t have been awarded the Olympics in the first place. Let them erase the slums and build decent dwellings for the poor people they have at their disposal, then ask them to parade as a civilised nation. I am talking about the leeches at top, and not the Brazilian people… bonsaiman I am Brazilian and I must partially agree with the previous comments. Partially because if this “sports heritage” is crumbling, so are the ones of ALL countries, England is no exception. Just google the subject. But yes, corruption is there for anyone to see, cost of living is ridiculous (in my last trip to London I felt like a millionaire) but regarding slums and the like, I guess all countries suffer from some sort of social problems like this. The periphery of the major cities where the poor and the illegal immigrants live aren’t exactly the most civilized spots I’ve been. Someone threw acid in the face of a friend in the London subway. In a single trip to Paris another friend was assaulted in the subway AND in the Arch of Triumph. This sort of thing may happen anywhere, in some places more than in others. And talking about capitalising on problems, the once infamous, now famous Brazilian slums are making a huge profit from European and American tourists, eager to see the “uncivilised”. Lemons and lemonades, if you like. http://twitter.com/burtja @burtja Holding the World Cup or Olympics means a huge investment in infrastructure. Brazil committed to that when they signed up. Let’s ignore the success of London. But look at South Africa, they built almost all the stadiums for the World Cup from scratch, held a great show (I was there) and will benefit for a long time to come from the success. I’m sad because I wanted to go to the Brazil World Cup – I’m not planning to any more because I’m fairly certain the powers that be will not be able to deliver the sort of experience I had in SA. urbane.abuse Well as for South Africa, they seem to have a similar problem in Cape Town: http://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/R1m-to-investigat… Durden T I’m Brazilian too and I can assure you that the WC or Olympics are going to be massive and great events. But the politicians control the construction to be able to steal more and don’t care at all about the quality of the projects. We have great architects today in our country, but none of them was invited to propose even a simple plan. And I say invited, because no projects ongoing are the result of a competition. Strange, no?

But on the second day of its three-day visit, the IOC coordination commission for the 2016 Games was met by news that the venue of the diving competition may be switched to a different location after a request by the international swimming federation, and the company claiming ownership of the land where the Olympic golf course will be built said it will officially notify the IOC about an ongoing legal dispute. Work had been halted at Maracana on Monday as employees demanded better wages and benefits, but they returned to the construction site after Rio's governor got involved in the negotiation and said a better offer was going to be made. The union representing the workers said a full-scale strike was still possible depending on the new offer, but work was under way as the IOC's coordination commission stopped by the iconic soccer stadium, which is being refurbished for the 2014 World Cup and the Rio Games. "Everything was normal when the IOC visited," said Nilson Duarte, the president of the union representing the workers. "A decision on a strike will be made by the end of the week, but it appears that there will be an agreement that will fulfill the workers' demands." A strike would likely create problems to get the stadium ready for the Confederations Cup, the World Cup warm-up tournament that will be played June 15-30. Maracana will host three matches, including the final. The stadium was originally scheduled to be ready in December, but FIFA was forced to extend its deadlines because of ongoing delays. Although the Maracana shouldn't give the IOC much of a headache, the Olympic golf course may be reason for concern as construction has yet to begin with three years to go before the sport makes its return to the games after more than 100 years. The coordination commission is in Rio to meet with local organizers and monitor the progress made at venues and infrastructure sites for the first Olympics in South America. It is its first visit of the year, and it comes just two months after the IOC told local organizers that "time is ticking" and they must attack the project "with all vigor" to guarantee a successful games in 2016. IOC President Jacques Rogge said last week he doesn't think he will need to publicly warn organizers about delays, but Brazil has been under pressure to show that preparations are on track.
